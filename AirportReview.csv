aalborg-airport,Klaus Malling,Denmark,"A small very effective airport with few flights. Check-in is notorious quick and staff friendly arrival very quick and busses to Aalborg frequent. Usually no problems getting taxis as well. There used to be a cafeteria but nowadays just a kiosk - but good cafeteria with reasonable prizes inside terminal. Security check quick and friendly as well. There is a nice viewing pavilion at one end of the airport. Outside note the famous ""kiss and goodbye signs"". Restrooms outside terminal however few.",9,1
aalborg-airport,S Kroes,Netherlands,This is a nice and modern airport at the moment they are expanding the airport so there is a lot of building going on but in the departure area you will not notice this very much. The Airport has got free Wifi and a small restaurant with shop on the land side. Airside you will find a small shop with pre-packed sandwiches and hot dogs and other small stuff a small duty free shop is also around but not very cheap. There is no Lounge to be found at the moment but after the expansion is completed there will be one available (around May 2013). Check-in procedures are fast and the waiting area after check-in is fine with a view on the tarmac. All in all a nice modern but small airport with expensive restaurants and shop.,9,1
aalborg-airport,M Andersen,Denmark,A very nice airy terminal - that seems modern enough. Free WIFI and free parking. Everything within walking distance. Most people travel domestic to Copenhagen but a rising number of international routes e.g. AAL-AMS makes for a lot of possibilities. Check-in is very quick and so is Security. All in all a nice experience.,9,1
aalborg-airport,Paul Van Alsten,France,AMS-AAL and quite satisfied with this regional airport. Only a few flights per day so baggage reclaim understandably very quick. Bus line 2 connects with downtown Aalborg every 15 minutes weekdays but only hourly during the weekend - travel time is 15 mins and costs 18DKK. Check-in efficient and hassle-free using self-service kiosks. Free Internet computers are available landside - a nice touch. Security staff very friendly. Boarding area is rather cramped with limited seating - do not go airside too early.,5,0
aalborg-airport,K Fischer,,Very quick check-inn and security screening. Nice and airy. Free parking! No need to show up at the airport very early as is the case in CPH. Only drawback is that after security you will be standing and waiting for the gate to open. There is is very little space here and no where to sit down.,4,0
aalborg-airport,M Larsen,,Aalborg Lufthavn (AAL) is a smallish airport near the city of Aalborg. There is not usually a lot of people leaving or arriving at any one time so there is hardly ever any time wasted standing in line for check-in or security checks - brilliant! A very friendly and inviting atmosphere overall.,5,0
aalborg-airport,J Plum,,Nice big cafe on first floor with great view Overall very bright free access to computers for checking mails etc while waiting. Easy access to city centre of Aalborg via taxi or even a local bus direct from airport to city centre.,4,0
aalborg-airport,P Panagopoulos,,It's a depressing airport in a depressing town! SAS and Maersk are the only operators using it besides a few private owners and charter airlines. Use it only if you have to! If there's no taxi waiting outside it is difficult to go to the city centre. The only reason this airport exists is to serve passengers who fly abroad especially via CPH.,1,0
aalborg-airport,Pedro Gil,,Amazed to find that this little place gets reviews! I staged through here in April 05 enroute to LHR via CPH. Very bright clean and well designed airport. Good little cafe with interesting local food. All very efficient when I went through.,,0
aalborg-airport,Kent C Cooper,,I've been travelling through this airport every week for more than two years. Very easy access (12 min. from downtown Aalborg) right up to main entrance. SAS is really the only game in town once you get in and be prepared for delays on flights to/from Copenhagen (a 35-min. flight). Extremely clean as is the Danish way. Ground staff and crews are helpful enough but to any seasoned traveller this is a backwater airport. Again the SAS AAL-CPH-AAL leg is notorious for delays each week so if you have connecting flights out of CPH plan accordingly. Also upon arrival at AAL there are not always enough taxis waiting outside and you might have to wait a few minutes. Buses run into town on a regular basis but everthing at this small airport - taxis buses kiosk opening hours etc. - are all timed to coincide with arrivals and departures of flights from CPH.,,0
aarhus-airport,Paul Hastie,,Nice small friendly airport. Good transport links to the city by bus which meets flights and plenty of taxis. A few shops and cafes and very clean facilities.,,0
aberdeen-airport,John Murphy,United Kingdom,This airport gets worse on a monthly basis. They have spent 3 million pounds on a new front door when it needs bigger and up to date security. Anymore than one plane makes the queue terrible. Arrivals is so small you queue outside if you are sat at the back of the plane and then wait for the smallest baggage belt I have ever seen (I travel every week). It is by far the poorest airport I have had the unfortunate pleasure to use. I recommend using Edinburgh and commuting!,2,0
aberdeen-airport,M Cristea,Romania,"Small airport, our arrival was on Saturday, June 13, 10:30 PM. Unfortunately, there were three planes landed at the same time approx, and ours was the third, So we had to wait in lane in a crowded tiny corridor for frontier controls, but staff was efficient. Than we stayed in lane to get a taxi to reach city center for 45 mins. Departure was on Monday, June 22, at 12:10 PM, much better, smooth drop-off and security controls, no problem. Limited offer for eat/ drink and shopping, not overpriced, The Granite-City Restaurant in the main hall seemed to be OK! ",8,1
aberdeen-airport,P Reid,United Arab Emirates,"I've been coming through Aberdeen airport for a few years now and can't figure out how they can be so lethargic in making drastically-needed changes to improve passenger experience except of course where it can make them money like the new drop-off charge! Flew in last week from Amsterdam and used the Arrivals toilet which was more like a construction site portaloo cabin; cramped and unpleasant not a great welcome for visitors. Then leaving on an early flight on Saturday no food or drink facilities open landside queued for over 20mins to go through the security scanner (note this was at 5am for only the 2nd flight of the day) to find only 1 scanner in operation. Made it through for final boarding call so no breakfast for me! They really are kidding themselves calling it an international airport for the ""Oil capital of Europe"". I know many Aberdonians are ashamed of their airport and justifiably so.",1,0
aberdeen-airport,M Stewart,United Kingdom,Airport is small and convenient when flights can actually leave and the check in and security I experienced were fine. The airport lounges are OK too if you are frequent flyer. However the airport is not equipped for all weather flights apparently the runway is too short so delays or cancellations due to weather (a little bit of fog) occur as happened the only 2 times I visited and I understand this is not infrequent. A taxi driver who took me to a hotel (which I paid for myself) told me that when delays occur all the local hotels are full so I had to find a hotel way out of Aberdeen. The positive side for taxi drivers is that the one who took me said he'd had a passenger who was so desperate to get to Heathrow he paid Â£1000 (yes one thousand GBP) to get there. They staff at BA with whom I'd flown are unable to cope with queues very long at desks. Its more like a third world airport in that respect. One would have thought that with the importance of the oil industry etc that arrangements would have been made to improve capacity and capability.,2,0
aberdeen-airport,B Biscuit,United Kingdom,"Aberdeen is my local airport for 40 years and has grown from a quaint airfield to a merely adequate airport. Facilities are only ok you don't want to be hanging around any longer than strictly necessary. The food (you can't call it dining) options are very poor and very expensive by any airport standard. Then the transport links which are a whole subject on their own but the next bit is typical. If you have a late flight don't rely on getting a taxi as the drivers tend to just go home when they've made enough money to go golfing. Also don't ask them to go too far more than 15 miles into the country as that is too much bother for them and they will turf you out of their car even at 23.30hrs. If you can get basic civility from them then you're lucky. Opening the boot for you is a special treat. £16 for about 7 miles is the fare but they will take £20 from you. The 727 bus is fine but you can have a half hour wait in the freezing ""shelter"" and it only runs to the city centre and ends at 22.30(?). Long term (more than a day) off site parking is really your best/only option. Aberdeen where they built the terminal on the opposite side of the airport to the train station to give taxi drivers a job.",2,0
aberdeen-airport,Phil Lee,United Kingdom,Waiting for security check is a nightmare here don't understand why this airport is not taking measures to improve the wait time for passengers.,,0
aberdeen-airport,Fred Singer,United Kingdom,Truly awful airport. Toilets in airside arrivals are porta cabins! Baggage handling facilities very primitive. If delayed passenger seating virtually non existent. Eating facilities poor and very expensive. Security checks must be the slowest anywhere. Aberdeen is supposed to be Europe's oil capital? Well it's about time they had a decent airport.,1,0
aberdeen-airport,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,I believe 2013 was a record year for ABZ in terms of passenger numbers 2014 is up on that - and it shows. Dreadful crowding - airside landside check-in baggage handling security passenger facilities - everything is operating at way beyond its design capacity. Happily I only have to spend an hour there on Departure and 30 mins on Arrival. I feel sorry for the people who have to work there.,3,0
aberdeen-airport,Justin Johnson,United Kingdom,As a regular user of Aberdeen airport I can safely say its one of the worse airports I have experienced the toilets airside are disgusting and usually smell quite appalling also the Servisair lounge is extremely poor and the choice of snacks / food is very basic considering the amount of footfall and the claim of international status it is extremely poor. Security and baggage reclaim is inefficient and far too small.,2,0
aberdeen-airport,S Ritchie,United Kingdom,"I find trying to book flights virtually anywhere out of Aberdeen nigh on impossible. You used to be able to get to many destinations with one stop in London - technically impossible now thanks to BA dropping Aberdeen to London Gatwick. The only route to Gatwick is EasyJet which has two flights a day as far as I can see which will fleece you for your long haul cases and not give you any guarantee for your onward flight. This level of service to a supposedly international airport is a joke. The international arrivals ""area"" is dirty cramped and there is nowhere to sit. You have to try to stay out of the way of the crowds waiting for their luggage. You can't see people coming you have to loiter around a small corner. It's truly bizarre and the most unwelcoming arrival area I've ever seen in an airport. The luggage belts are in desperate need of an addition. It's all well and good have a nicer departures lounge and fancy coffee but where precisely are we meant to be flying? Having to walk onto the Tarmac in wind and rain or even better snowy conditions to haul your case up a flight of stairs does not exactly make for a modern airport facility. The check in desks are under-served and the security slow at busy times. The only good thing is that security and customs are actually nice here unlike everywhere else!",1,0
aberdeen-airport,S Fraser,United Kingdom,We arrived for a holiday and had to stay in a queue for an hour and a half this is totally unacceptable. I've been to a few airports and this one is the worst by far. We can only travel to a very few destinations and I gather this is because of the cost of landing here. The whole area is small and there are very few shops - if this is because of Aberdeen Council then they really need to open their eyes and see how other airports are run. People in Aberdeen don't want to travel to Edinburgh or Glasgow to go on holiday but they have no option - this needs to be sorted out. I've also recently heard that the flights from Aberdeen to London are being cut and Edinburgh and Glasgow are getting extra.,,0
aberdeen-airport,M Ferguson,United Kingdom,One luggage carousel poor quality and expensive food airside. What more can I say. On the plus side it is clean and there are tables in security to help you sort out shoes jacket liquids laptop but the area is very small. The seating in the gate area is not that comfortable most often you get on and off the plane by steps-rarely an airbridge as in many other airports. The addition of the multi storey carpark indicates extra footfall and the check in queues have been alleviated by the move of the BA desks round the corner but the airport has a long way to go!,3,0
aberdeen-airport,Leslie Forbes,United Kingdom,On Sunday 1st September I arrived at Aberdeen Airport from London. The Journey took about an hour and ten minutes which is about the usual time. On arrival I could not get anywhere near the baggage re-claim area due to a huge backlog and crowds of people. It then took me and most everyone else 1 hour and 10 minutes to get our bags from the arrivals hall. How this can this be called an International airport beats me! It really is an embarrassment.,,0
aberdeen-airport,Leslie Forbes,United Kingdom,Just back into Aberdeen Airport from Zurich via Amsterdam. Both of these Airports have great transport links using trams and trains. Aberdeen and Zurich can't be compared of course on size but the cramped and disgusting toytown railcar at the wrong end of the airport is hardly suitable. In both of these airports and at most others you can get a trolley for your bag without needing a coin. Last night I along with many other newcomers to Aberdeen I arrived before 10 to find trolleys all chained up and the bar closed. Do all foreign visitors have a pound coin ready for their trolley?,,0
aberdeen-airport,S Davidson,United Kingdom,I wish to echo the sentiments expressed in the review by Marion Johnston. The flight options to common holiday destinations like Tenerife etc are abysmal from Aberdeen Airport. Unless you are going on an overpriced package deal with Thomas Cook Thomson's etc and book around 8-12 months in advance you're only other option is a convoluted chain of flights transfers and even overnight hotels via Edinburgh Glasgow or London. I know of many other people from Aberdeen who concur. The runway extension is obviously a start for greater potential but I'm not seeing a greatly populated list of destinations to boot!,3,0
aberdeen-airport,Marion Johnston,United Kingdom,I am fed up of taking the bus to Edinburgh or Glasgow to get a flight to the Costa Blanca because there is nothing from Aberdeen. I travel at least 5 times each year and know many other people who do the same. Every time I fly from Edinburgh of Glasgow I meet people from the North East of Scotland. Jet2.com Easyjet Ryanair Thomson Airways and Thomas Cook all put on flights from Edinburgh and/or Glasgow - sometime several flights a day leave to Alicante and flights are available all year round. How can Aberdeen airport not justify 1 flight per week to Alicante all year round? The airport is in the dark ages and cannot get past the mentality of providing an airport that is for business use only.,2,0
aberdeen-airport,El Mac,United Kingdom,As a regular business traveller commuting between Manchester and Aberdeen I can truly say that the customer experience at Aberdeen Airport has deteriorated rapidly. Issues with Airlines and the haphazard Taxi services aside and there are plenty Aberdeen Airport is clearly struggling to cope with increased passenger traffic particularly as the Summer holiday season commences. The Security experience has to be seen to be believed the security queue winds its way through what can only be described as a chicane to the first point where an airport employee scans your boarding pass 10-15 minutes later you emerge into the Security Hall. Often undermanned this has 3 scanners 2 of which are in operation. With no control the queue effectively crowds pushing you forward until your turn to disrobe comes. Once through Security you're then funnelled through Duty Free and into the Airside 'Lounge' - not the most welcoming of places. If you're travelling with colleagues or as a family forget being able to hold a conversation. Every airline makes constant announcements there is the obligatory Pre-Board but that is followed by constant reminders as boarding begins with the frequent call for 'lost' passengers. On the subject of size Aberdeen has plans to expand. One could say grand plans but if they can't cope at the moment what hope is there for the traveller? The facilities within Aberdeen effectively close down from 20.30 making for a miserable experience if you're unfortunate to suffer the all too frequent delay.,2,0
aberdeen-airport,Nigel Stacey,United Kingdom,Not too bad it was easy to check-in. One thing I found strange was the baggage conveyer came out near the entrance to the airport. There are a few places to get a drink and a bite to eat. To get into Aberdeen the station is a bus or taxi journey away from the terminal itself. There are a couple of hotels close by but they are a bit pricey. All in all it I not too bad could do with a bit of a make over.,8,1
aberdeen-airport,Alistair Peckham,United States,Security efficient. Fire alarm went off just a few minutes before expected time of boarding. Meant exiting the terminal and going land-side. Fire service took 15 mins to arrive. Airport staff very professional and efficient once re-entry to the airport. Security was very fast efficient with passengers with flights boarding having priority and being called forward. Departure was delayed just over an hour.,7,1
aberdeen-airport,T Collier,United Kingdom,I really do wonder why Aberdeen have so many check-in desks (for BA flights) when they don't bother opening them! Had to wait near enough 30 minutes to check luggage in for it to go in the hold and made me wish I hadn't bothered! Security was very quiet thankfully so that was easy to negotiate. Ordered a burger at the bar post security and it took over 20 minutes for it to arrive - very frustrating when the place was dead and you can see the plane you are about to get on come in to land! Thankfully I did have time to quickly eat it just before heading to the gate.,5,0
aberdeen-airport,M Creed,United Kingdom,Having battled dreadful weather conditions overnight through the Scottish Highlands I eventually arrived at the airport 10 minutes before my morning flight was due to leave. Faced with an enormous queue to get through security I asked possibly the most sour and rude security woman I've ever met on the gate if she could rush me through. I received a lecture informing me I should leave more time to get to the airport and to stay where I was in the queue. Fortunately people already in the queue heard the nasty mean spirited diatribe I received and ushered me to the front of the security queue and I did get my flight (which luckily was delayed 10 minutes anyway). A thoroughly unpleasant and distressing experience. My first and last flight from Aberdeen.,,0
aberdeen-airport,Kathleen Lawrie,Spain,I travel to Aberdeen from Spain and have to rely on buses from Glasgow or Edinburgh. If Aberdeen is such a good airport why are there no flights from Alicante Murcia or Almeria to Aberdeen. We used to be able to fly with Flyglobespan and it was excellent. Please make it easier for us to come to Aberdeen to visit our family.,,0
aberdeen-airport,Mark Brewer,United Kingdom,Aberdeen airport works well most of the time. The only thing I can see that really lets the place down is the lack of toilet facilities air side. It's not unusual here to see queues of 8 or 9 in a gents toilet as was the case on a Saturday morning in July recently. This is something that really does need sorting out as other aspects of the airport are largely perfectly adequate.,4,0
aberdeen-airport,S Reid,,Avoid this airport on outbound flights in the afternoon particularly on Friday. Allow up to 1hr for the security screening process. You can pay an additional £5 to jump to the top of the security queue. I have not seen this at any other airport. Staff are friendly but another one/two security screening stations are required to cope at peak times. The luggage arrivals belt is small and if three flights land at once you scramble for your bags. On exiting the airport the smokers are just outside the door with the discarded cigarette ends on the pavement. Not a very nice welcome to Aberdeen. If you have the option avoid this airport or use it out of peak hours - not easy due to the remote location. I have recently used Terminals 3/4 and 5 at Heathrow and Aberdeen Airport is worse than these.,1,0
aberdeen-airport,E Douglas,,International arrivals tiny baggage retrieval approx 15 mins Rail link non existant bus services limited taxis expensive. Airport clean and tidy good choice of car hire.,3,0
aberdeen-airport,B Hewitt,,Arrival okay bags quickly through departure left from a gate which had only 6 seats so passengers had to stand in a very narrow corridor. Which was not pleasant on a hot day.,2,0
aberdeen-airport,Marybeth Richards,,Pocket sized airport that seems to be bursting at the seams at times. Waited 15 minutes for bags to start to appear on the belt after a flight from LHR - unusual as the place really isn't that big. Better bus connections to the city centre would be great. but not likely to happen. On the whole not a bad little airport.,4,0
aberdeen-airport,Ken Taylor,,Vast improvement in security screening procedures ( in terms of their ability to cope). Still a couple of surly staff who need retrained. Home Office bloke checking passports on the way back in is much nicer than he used to be and even managed a smile !,4,0
aberdeen-airport,Iain Williamson,,I've been using Aberdeen airport infrequently over the last ten years. The staff remain the friendliest and most polite I've seen in any airport and there is something exhilirating and about coming into this Northern city usually in a small aircraft bouncing in through high winds. The small airport usually allows for quick access to bus or taxi. Waiting for a bus can take some time though. The airport retains a nice atmosphere overall and is always clean.,,0
aberdeen-airport,Iain Cowe,,As a very regular passenger through Aberdeen Airport I can see that BAA have put in a lot of time and money expanding and re-shaping their departures area which has resulted in a nicer experience for passengers departing ABZ. The staff are efficient and friendly if sometimes a bit harassed but they cope admirably. Unfortunately the same is not experienced by international passengers arriving in the airport. The staff are good but in this day and age with ABZ trying to attract more international flights one tiny international arrivals area is not really sufficient. ABZ has international flights departing almost on top of one another at various times during the day and for each departure - you guessed it there's an arrival. I have experienced on many occasions being forced to wait outside the arrivals area in nothing more than a covered walkway while the previous plane load of passengers clear the immigration area and pass into baggage reclaim (the same room). Once in all international flights have one carousel for baggage which can sometimes have 2 or 3 planeloads (anything from EMB145s to B737s) of passengers round it. All in all not a great effort from Aberdeen Airport however it has served the North-East of Scotland and the North Sea oil industry very well over the years. I hope they go on doing so in the future but the management there really need to look at what they are going to do with extra passengers as their numbers will inevitably increase.,,0
aberdeen-airport,Tim Jones,,A bit chaotic due to extension work but very efficient going through security. Food ok and not too bad pricewise. Smoking is outside at either end of the terminal (bus shelters placed for bad weather) but most people just stood outside front door and it looked very messy - BAA staff doing nothing about it. Quick for getting bags through from the aircraft which is useful. Also at rush hour might be a good idea to pre- book a cab - they were overwhelmed!,,0
aberdeen-airport,Gordon Wiseman,,Used Aberdeen airport to fly to and back from to Amsterdam. The customer service at the airport was of a high standard and public transport to the city centre is reliable. Would gladly use Aberdeen again to travel domestically or to continental Europe. The recent news that weekly flights to popular destinations in Portugal and Spain will be available soon will also add to the appeal of this airport for travellers from Northern Scotland.,,0
aberdeen-airport,Steve Ward,,The only real choice if flying to Aberdeen! Overall OK but very limited choice of food and shopping. Staff are friendly and queues generally short.,,0
aberdeen-airport,Matthew Ross,,Aberdeen Airport is fairly good and efficient but with some room for improvement. I recently flew to the Faroe Islands on Atlantic Airways. On the return the luggage took a very long time to arrive; also there was confusion at the passport control over the status of green Faroese passports with many passengers standing in the wrong queue. This created a negative first impression for visitors; attention to detail and clearer signage is necessary. A more important concern is the inadequate bus service (route 27) between the airport and the city centre. It is very poorly marketed infrequent and does not run at all at weekends - leading to a massive queue for taxis. A regular shuttle bus between the airport university (Old Aberdeen) city centre and the railway station is needed.,,0
aberdeen-airport,William Callaghan,,Overall nice small airport with good connections to major hubs in Europe such as London (Heathrow/Gatwick/Luton) Amsterdam and Paris CDG. Also has flights to most major UK destinations. I found that travelling through the airport was relatively quick and hassle-free. Good bus service to the city centre which is about 10 km from the aiport and reasonably priced. Would recommend this airport to anyone living in the North of Scotland as an alternative to GLA/EDI. Further considerations for this small but expanding aiprt would be to add services to Spain and Italy as well as to some Central European cities such as Berlin/Prague/Warsaw.,,0
aberdeen-airport,A Lamont,,ABZ is a convenient airport with ever-improving routes to and fro. Work has begun on modernising the airport and there are more plans in the pipeline. ABZ is convenient and reliable. The only thing you can't rely on is the weather there. That is the biggest problem with ABZ and there isn't much that can be done about it.,,0
aberdeen-airport,Ron Dickie,,"Hopefully the new airport manager will manage to drag the airport in the 21st century. The new Servisair lounge for KLM/AF etc is a great leap forward although the suede chairs I feel may suffer from high mileage usage through a relatively short time frame. AF need to have a larger presence at check-in and these Servis air check-in crew need to be trained on how to put mileage onto a frequent flyer card even when I say ""have you done it"" they say ""yes"". I log in (around a month later) to find that my mileage has not been credited. As a local I shouldn't really gripe but on the whole both air side and land side it could be a lot better. Maybe a trip to some of the Scandinavian airports would get their creative side into drive.",,0
aberdeen-airport,Dave Aiton,,I have used Aberdeen International Airport extensively through the years and found it to be out of date and touch with modern international and domestic commuter travel the quality of the departure lounges are very poor and the delays when returning from international flights is disgraceful the baggage collection system whether domestic or international is pathetic.,,0
aberdeen-airport,Steve Gavigan,,I have used Aberdeen Airport several times in the last couple of years and have not had any problems. Everything works properly and the staff are very friendly. The security checks at the departure lounge are most thorough.,,0
aberdeen-airport,Rob Wallace,,When will they do something about the taxi rank? Its a little hut that holds about 40 people - often the queue stretches well outside - and at Aberdeen that is not a good idea. They also have sold the concession to one company so that other firms having dropped people off cannot pick up so you are stuck waiting for the chosen people to arrive.,,0
aberdeen-airport,Jane Newman,,I use Aberdeen Airport frequently and am impressed with it. It's a small airport but seems to have everything to cope with its passenger flow. I definitely recommend the newly refurbished 'Food Hub' restaurant where the staff are very friendly and courteous. There is always a hot food menu with different choices to suit everyone a selection of sandwiches and delicious home-bakes - I always look forward to my meal there before I fly home!! The airport has gone through a lot of changes recently such as the larger renovated toilets the new 'Coral' betting shop and the new departures layout.,,0
aberdeen-airport,Kevin Yates,,I fly in and out of Aberdeen Dyce airport a lot and have seen a marked improvement over recent weeks. Larger toilet facilities at arrivals (where their was only 1 for men and 1 for women). KLM has vastly improved it's check in facilities with usually 4-5 servis air staff in attendance. Departure lounge 1 has been improved with more seating. It could how ever improve it's lost luggage office (a real mess) which you will need to visit if you fly KLM often. Security entrance to departure lounge has changed as well with two baggage scanners (1 only ever in use though) and one personal scanner which is the bottle neck and leads to delays. All in all though Aberdeen airport is fine.,,0
aberdeen-airport,Jordan Dias,,Nice small friendly airport with helpful staff. Not much to do there but the shops are ok and not crowded.,,0
abidjan-airport,Anoma Yao,,Small airport but modern and clean facility. No hustlers in the terminal unlike in most African airports. Not much queuing at check-in immigration and security. Air-conditioning functions toilets are clean airbridges and no pax busses but poor amenities: no wifi tiny duty free zone and unattractive lounge.,8,1
abidjan-airport,Pedro Gil,,I frequently travel through this airport and would note a couple of problems in an otherwise nice facility. First I've arrived on another airline and been unable to get help in the transit lounge from Air I'voire even though they are my next flight. You have to get somebody to take you to the front desk through a little back hallway and tip them. Second if you go through the passport desk they have plain clothed policemen without badges who demand your passport in the luggage area without identifying themselves. The restaurant in the departure area is much nicer than the one outside the ticket area where you check in.,,0
abidjan-airport,Grant Macpherson,,I've been through ABJ Airport a number of times over the last couple of years and consider it the best airport in West / Central Africa possible one of the newest. Very clean and friendly with good security. Customs and Immigration take a while to get through but post 9/11 it's no worse than in the States or Europe. Air france the main carrier to/from Europe has additional security prior to boarding the plane. Check in staff and airport Staff both landside and airside very helpfull generally very good Duty Free taking both CFA Euro Dollars and credit cards,,0
abidjan-airport,M Meiners,,"I had to visit Abidjan this January. There is no doubt the airport is more than a pleasant surprise: One would expect the worst for any West African ariport in general and even more for this one keeping in mind that the country is fairly isolated and suffering from heavy civil unrest and at the edge of civil war keeping most western travellers and business away. In fact the airport corresponds totally to European counterparts of the same size (fairly small thus). The terminal building is very new and has been totally rebuild in a quite recent past with all confort one can expect: Aircondition normal sanitary facilities and yes all is clean and in good working condition! On arrival jet aircrafts just dock at a direct tunnel connection to the building distances are quite short. All controls are very smooth with absolutely no bribes to give to any official. While standing in line for passport control a ""doctor"" passes trough the lines and checks vaccinations (Yellow fever is compulsory) every where there is security passport control is smooth and efficient although every one tries to be closest to the luggage belt this also goes quite smoothly including inspection of luggage. No unauthorized people in the arrival area and nowhere unpleasant people insisting on ""helping"" you carrying your luggage and then trying to run away with it (apparently some people do have a sort of authorization to enter customs area for helping passengers but not insisting). Departure also is quite smooth: Check in is done in an enclosed area with identity check at the entrance so here also one is safe after checking in there is just a short way up the stairs passing customs and then to the departure hall. Here also with all normal facilities: duty free shop large restaurant area some smaller shops and sanitary facilities still clean and in good working order! Altogether thus a pleasant experience!",,0
abu-dhabi-airport,James Anderson,Saudi Arabia,"I flew from Bahrain to Phuket and back via Abu Dhabi. Coming in, the airport is overcrowded and the extra security checkpoint for transit passengers grinds traffic to a halt. Shopping is plentiful. Unfortunately, bathrooms all had queues out the door and dining options are all located in one small area upstairs, very far from the gates. After boarding, we spent an hour on the tarmac waiting for ground crews to load bags. On the return leg, we were piled into buses then driven out and parked in front of three different aircraft for 30 min while the driver tried to find the right plane. When we boarded, we again spent an hour waiting while ground crews shuffled bags around. After arriving in Bahrain it turned out that only 7 bags had been loaded for the entire flight. We spent another 90 min in line while staff in Bahrain tried to clean up the mess and report all the missing baggage. As of yet our luggage has not turned up. I will never fly through Abu Dhabi again.",2,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Jay Sitlani,United States,"Transiting through AUH is an ordeal, and lets down the very good inflight product of its dominant hub carrier Etihad. Herding transit passengers through a security line (and forcing premium pax into their own dedicated but much slower line) and requiring them to take their belts, shoes, watches, phones, plus anything else in their pockets off is absurd. And if you're connecting to the US, then you have to repeat this farcical performance. A new terminal is being constructed, and while I suspect it will be posh and modern and beautiful, it will still be burdened by these transit procedures. Etihad is a fabulous carrier, but the transit at AUH will make me think twice before I choose it for my long haul travel needs.",4,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Loay Osman,United Arab Emirates,Very confusing airport and not user friendly. Strange lay out. Lounges are cramped and not enough food and beverage  outlets. Extremely expensive duty free. Bathrooms looks shabby and not very well maintained. Overall the airport looks very tired. Too many announcements. However AUH are building their new airport,4,0
abu-dhabi-airport,A Shanmugasundaram,Italy,I had a 5 hour transit here and overall experience was good.The duty free shops were a bit crowded but could find some good stuff to buy. The staffs were experienced to handle the passengers of the delayed arrival flights to their transfer flights.,7,1
abu-dhabi-airport,Nur Afiqah Rahmat,United Arab Emirates,"I've lost count the amount of times I've traveled in and out of this airport, but I have been to all 3 terminals to review them here. Terminal 1: This is where all the other airlines (not low cost) flies out to and out from. Small considering its Abu Dhabi, where all the money is at. You are required to scan your luggage prior to check in and 'apparently' only passengers are allowed to go there, even if you're just there to buy flight tickets which is located inside. Only one small coffee shop before the immigration check for you to hang with your loved ones before you say goodbye. Inside the terminal past security, only few stores available, and all are tiny. Terminal 2: This is where the low costs airlines such as Rotana Jet flies in or out from. Terminal is tiny, looks like a ghost town with only one coffee shop that surprisingly has good food. Coming in to the terminal was another nightmare. I've flown in twice here and both times were jam packed. It's as if the queue is never ending. Terminal 3: This is where all the Etihad flights come in and out from. Much better than the other 2 terminals and you can actually check in at the counter with another person accompanying you. Shops inside the terminal passed immigration is better than Terminal 1, although still not as amazing as Dubai Terminal 3 or Doha airport. Still, not recommended for transit more than 3 hours. I had to give mix stars for this airport due to the different service quality that is displayed across different terminals. Oh and wifi was awful on all 3 terminals.",4,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Paul Caunter,Thailand,"Avoid this airport whatever class you are flying. Overcrowded, rude staff, lack of clean toilets, long queues. Etihad call it their home!",,0
abu-dhabi-airport,A Mansfield,Australia,"The most ridiculous experience at any airport. Get to gate 32 which is squeezed in a corner at the end of the floor and 1 hour out from boarding it is locked up. All there is is a tiny domestic sized lounge to sit on and wait. When staff eventually arrive there is another security screening with a manual bag search of every passenger to enter the gate lounge. No drinks purchased gate side of security are allowed into the sitting area so bottle just bought to drink while waiting goes in bin. No toilets once inside the gate either so onboard in an hour they are going to be popular! Basically if you are departing this gate you are trapped in a security hell. Avoid it at all costs. Not the way to end a long trip with many wonderful, efficient airlines and terminals. Though the Etihad airline experience has been good this part is just a bad joke. A reason to not fly Etihad via Abu Dhabi again.",,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Harsh Modi,India,Horrible airport. Baggage was lost because of airport mismanagement. Shoddily planned airport with some gates holed up in corner. Travel time between gates very high. Baggage handling very inadequate. Very confusing directions.,4,0
abu-dhabi-airport,G Vlcek,Australia,Sydney to London via Abu Dhabi with three hour stop over. Easy to navigate around airport staff very helpful shopping and food services adequate.

abu-dhabi-airport,David Pegg,South Africa,Flew on SAA from Jo'burg to Abu Dhabi and we were over the airport when the captain announced we were 12th in the queue for landing with a resultant 40 minute circle before landing. Once in the immigration hall in terminal 1 another 70 minute queue. It is obvious the airport cannot cope with the increased traffic and the passenger experience becomes very poor. In the past my wife and I used Abu Dhabi rather than Dubai but I am having a serious rethink.,5,0
abu-dhabi-airport,S Corey,Ireland,Long queues at baggage staff kept wandering away from their posts to chat to other members of staff. Once we finally cleared it we walked to where a man checked your passport and ticket. Another long queue for this. Walked a few more meters where we had to queue again for someone else to check our passport! I have no idea why! I was travelling with a child and the man at the desk was rude to her as she had not got her passport opened at the correct page! An airport I have no intention of visiting again.,,0
abu-dhabi-airport,T Rollings,United Kingdom,When I arrived in Abu Dhabi from Bangkok it was early afternoon. Airport seemed empty. It didn't take that long to get through passport control even with a brief spell of getting lost and confused and also a stop off at the toilet - (although I do agree there may not be enough toilets) - Yes there was a queue at immigration but it didn't seem burdensomely long (probably about eight people in front of me). The official was polite and smiled. I was processed relatively quickly as indeed was everyone else. My rucksack came reasonably quickly on the carousel even though I was one of the last people to join the carousel. My vehicle transfer didn't show up. I was left wandering around the terminal building wondering what I was going to do. Eventually I was rescued by a kindly man who made a few enquiries on my behalf and very soon I was picked up and whisked to my hotel. My overriding memory of the airport was just how empty it was that and nothing else. As for duty frees - it's a smallish airport so I didn't expect to see all kinds of shops.,7,1
abu-dhabi-airport,S Simon,United Kingdom,Trying to kill 15 hours in this place since we just found out my wife is unable to leave the airport. She's a Thai citizen and the visa required to spend a few hours in Abu Dhabi will cost $70US and take 8 hours to arrange. Mine is free and instant. This information wasn't mentioned anywhere when we looked yesterday. This airport is very small and dull - especially compared to Dubai. Etihad gave us some free meal vouchers at the transport desk which was unexpected. Shame this means McDonalds or the pasta place next door. I ordered spaghetti bolognese but got chicken curry. Free wifi is a plus. Airport hotel is very expensive and fully booked. Not too busy at minute but was rammed on our last visit. Won't come back.,2,0
abu-dhabi-airport,J Nascimento,United Kingdom,A taxi driver suggested to us that roadworks are never really finished in Abu Dhabi. They finish it realise that is was done wrongly and re-do it. Well pretty soon someone will realise that AUH terminal 3 is wrong… It is narrow cramped with a ceiling that makes me (6ft’2”tall) uncomfortable. If you are using or planning to use Etihad and AUH as your hub please understand: this is not DXB Terminal 3. Not even a poor version of it. It feels like a toy airport. Quite unbelievable how bad it is. Even DMK (the old Bangkok airport) feels more spacious. Hope you will not need to use the toilets. They are disgusting. With Dubai and Qatar nearby I don't see the point of ever using AUH again. Etihad is not that great as an airline. Saving £50 here or there and having to transit through this is just not worth.,1,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Rita Sunman,United Kingdom,Having just been through this airport in transit 7/3/15 can honestly say this is the worst airport we have been in transit through. Firstly not enough toilets endless queues and wet floor in cubicles sinks in toilets broken no soap in dispensers no hand towels in dispensers. Not enough seating areas poor layout in all areas poor signage not enough refreshment areas for the volume of people. Terminal 1 - far too small for volume of people. We were in terminal 3 again not enough toilets or seating we had to stand outside gate 32 for 3 hours waiting for the gate seating area to be opened with hundreds of other people elderly infirm babies and toddlers all sitting on the floor because of no seats while we could see the gate area through the glass all locked off with hundreds of seats available but we weren't allowed in to use them - this was disgraceful! We were allowed in 10 mins before boarding boarding delayed no explanation finally boarded the plane late take-off delayed for nearly an hour because the fuelling and luggage wasn't complete. The plane was sat on the runway 4 hours before takeoff. Throughout our transit no customer service whatsoever from Etihad.,,0
abu-dhabi-airport,T Farnum,,A joke and completely unacceptable. My parents flew in on a connecting flight from Frankfurt. They touched down at 21.45 but did not get out of the airport until 1.25am! They had to line up for over three hours at customs where they were made to fill out some new form whose English translation was completely ridiculous and impossible to understand. The customs official did not even look at this document when they finally made it to the customs desk! If Abu Dhabi wants to be an attractive tourist destination they are going to have to ensure speedy and efficient service at the airport which is your first point of contact with the UAE. Right now it is very far from being a world class airport.,,0
abu-dhabi-airport,H Prins,South Africa,I was shocked to experience the enormous waiting time to clear immigration - it took me three hours of standing in a slow-moving line of exhausted people. That is not what I had expected of a place that wants to attract tourism. Of course I will continue using the airport because it is a hub for if one wants to travel from Southern Africa to Asia but in future I will try my utmost to avoid this. Beyond belief.,,0
abu-dhabi-airport,F Marc,Australia,Worst airport I have been to it is a complete mess. I strongly believe that this airport could not handle such huge amount of travellers. After a long flight transit passengers usually need a quiet place to relax change clothes use the bathroom and charge electronic devices. This airport could provide any of them. Toilets are full and are also dirty. People lie on the floor blocking the passageway while restaurants are all occupied there are no place to sit either. Even if I could sit somewhere power plugs can be hardly found in the gates. Trying to appeal as a luxurious airport while providing such poor facilities is not a good combination believe me. Next time I would rather fly via Doha or Dubai.,2,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Michael Schade,United Arab Emirates,I am a frequent traveller and I have seen my share of dysfunctional airports but nothing compares to the AUH airport. It did not catch up with its growth over the past few years and passengers have to pay dearly for that shortcoming. It took me 2h from stepping into the building until I reached the gate. There are long queues everywhere check in passport control security and even toilets. Staff are stressed and grouchy. There are at peak hours no seats anywhere in or near the gates. The old and rundown terminal 1 is even worse. I guess passengers have to put up with this till the new terminal opens in about two years.,,0
abu-dhabi-airport,D Crute,United Kingdom,Worst airport I have experienced. Very poor facilities nowhere near enough toilets for the amount of people. Long queues at security and rude staff.,2,0
abu-dhabi-airport,D Jacobs,Belgium,Transited the airport on the way to Ho Chi Min City ex. Brussels for the 3rd time this year. I'm a very frequent (business) traveller for over 30 years all over the world but Abu Dhabi ranks as one of the worst airports I have had to cross. The infrastructure cannot handle the massive inflow of passengers but the worst is that for some reason they 'forgot' to install a sufficient number of toilets. I have never experienced not even in the most remote airports such a lack of toilet facilities. In the premium lounge there were a 'total' of 4 toilets for men resulting in waiting lines of 10-12 people. Abu Dhabi rates itself very high and thinks it is upper class and grandeur but they are very wrong. Just the airport as such is for me reason to skip Etihad flights in the future or whatever flight uses this airport as transit.,,0
abu-dhabi-airport,R Jones,United Kingdom,Terrible airport! For a growing carrier like Etihad and the traffic growth all around the gulf Abu Dhabi seems to be lagging behind everyone else. In terminal 3 there are 6 bag drop desks for most of the Etihad fleet (that's over 100 a/c) and around 10 normal check in desks. Average queue time can be anything from 10mins to 1hr plus. Then all the passengers move across to boarder control where of course it is chaos again. Finally when you clear immigration and security you are presented with a terrible selection of shops restaurants and cafes and no seating what so ever (unless of course you don't mind sitting on the floor or the edge of a flower bed). Then when your flight is ready to board there is a single file queue to one maybe two people checking passports. So the queue here for a B777 or A340 is 15mins+. Then you board the a/c and you are away. From the moment you enter the airport to boarding the plane it is a nightmare. I hope the new midfield terminal will be better. I cannot imagine what the A380 with 450-500 passengers is going to look like in terminal 3! I really feel sorry for those passengers. The staff are very rude and not interested in the passenger experience and queuing for security is chaos as staff are shouting almost every world city for passengers to skip the queue for imminent departures so the flow of people in the queue is limited as people skip the queue. I didn't imagine this at all for a Middle Eastern airport.,1,0
abu-dhabi-airport,J Maughan Jones,United Kingdom,1st tine through and we have to queue to travel across the airport as the walkway has broken meaning no one can reach security. On the way home and there are no toilets all have closed for the last 45 minutes as they are out of water! It seemed quite poor generally but this is a joke.,,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Rohit Raj,India,One of the worst International terminals I have traveled through in the last 5 years. This airport is simply not able to cater to the growing traffic and Etihad's massive expansion. Took almost 2 hours to clear immigration. The staff behavior near the immigration counter is very rude and partial. Just 4 or 5 counters for foreign passport holders (GCC Passport holders have separate counters) and the queues were long. There is no space at all for sitting just one central area - crowded all of the time. Long queues on all tunnels leading to boarding gates as the same tunnel is used by the arriving passengers. This airport is full of chaos.,1,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Andy Williams,United Kingdom,I used AUH on my recent trip to the Philippines as a connection. On both legs I spent only 3 hours in the place. Arrived at Terminal 3 but was departing from Terminal 1 on my outbound leg. The airport website tells you it takes 20 minutes walk but it was more like 10 but I travel light and move fairly quick. Terminal 1 was chaos! It simply is not big enough to house the traffic in and out. Long queues and very little seating. It is also very expensive even for just a drink. Inbound leg both flights arrived and departed from Terminal 3 which is much better. Still the queues into the gates are too long. Had my passport and boarding pass checked twice in the space of 10 meters. All in this place still only gets an average rating. I would use this airport again providing Etihad's ticket prices are decent and hope I only have to use Terminal 3.,5,1
abu-dhabi-airport,Khurram Butt,United Kingdom,I travelled with two little children MAN-AUH-ISB return. On both occasions we had to go to terminal 3 from terminal 1 and I found it very smooth.

abu-dhabi-airport,L Mellor,Sweden,Last visited this airport in the 1980s. In a way I'll be sorry to see it go as its tiled doughnut satellites have stood the test of time architecturally speaking. Compare this with the monstrosity at Charles de Gaulle which seems to have aged in less than 10 years. The biggest problem in landing at the international airport is it take about 15 mins to taxi to/from the runway as the new airport terminal construction means that there are a series of contraflow taxi ways. I read a lot of complaints but I took a family of three young children through the terminal at 2:00am and nothing but praise for the staff and services. The Merc Taxis are spacious and not overpriced.,7,1
abu-dhabi-airport,GJ Kooij,Australia,"Picture an airport where the following happens. You arrive and exit from the plane into buses without aircon in the sweltering heat next to an Air Berlin A330. After a while the driver emerges switches the A/C on and drives forever past building sites and runways driving driving at one stage right next to the taxiway so it looks like we'll be clipped by a taxiing B747 driving driving until finally he stops at a rubbish tip. This is next to Gate 19 at an airport building. You enter into Gate 19 and learn that your connecting flight departs from Gate 53. Gate 19 is at a smallish circular building packed with people trying to find their way to other gates. Many need to go one floor up but the single narrow escalator has a 40 m waiting queue. So you take the stairs and follow signs for Gate 53. Walking walking round the corner past renovation sites walking walking oh look there's a narrow walkway but it is clogged with people walking. Gate 53 turns out to be in the ""new"" part of the airport. After a lot of more walking you find gate 53 in time for the boarding call. All passengers of a B777 form a single queue which is attended by a single person checking passport & boarding passes. Many airport staff members walk by merrily but have other tasks than helping out with the check-in procedures. Standing standing shuffling forward ah yes you have cleared the checking person and are guided to a bus. The bus fills up with people doors are closed but we don't move until four more buses are filled up as well only then does our convoy take off. We drive past building sites past the ""new"" part of the airport past a circular building driving come very close to the taxiway. The bus convoy stops four planes down and all passengers from the 5 buses form a single queue to board the plane. I travel extensively for my business and have never been at an airport where infrastructure was so bad plus the staff is very unapologetic. At least the staff at Heathrow apologise for the chaos. An absolute joke of an airport.",,0

House airliner Etihad constantly adding new destinations while the airport is already clogged with stressed transit passengers on the way to catch there next flight on time! Avoid this airport at all costs.,,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Vivek Mathur,India,"I was recently flying from BLR to ORD with a connecting flight at AUH. I expected my stopover at AUH to be pleasant. The experience was far from it. First of all directions to gates were not clear especially if you are not aware that your gate might be in a different terminal than your flight actually departs from. In my case my Etihad flight departed from the apron in front of Terminal 3 but my departure gate was Gate 8 in Terminal 1. When I got to Gate 8 (a very long walk from my arrival at the far end of Terminal 3) it was closed with nobody manning it and without any sort of notice. It turned out that the security screening for several gates was being channelled through a single line entering through a different gate although nobody was being told about it. The security screening process was slow. Once past the security process I had 2 hours to my connecting flight. Sadly there were no restaurants coffee shops or even snack counters in the departure area which had far less seating than one would expect for 777 flights. Even more sadly there wasn't a single water fountain or even a soda vending machine to quench one's thirst. For about 8 departure gates (all shuttle gates not aerobridges) there was only one toilet for females and one for males potentially having to serve a couple thousand waiting passengers. I noticed that the area had been updated with a big-screen TV lounge area and LED lighting but somehow the thought of providing adequate toilet and refreshment facilities doesn't seem to have occurred to the authorities. I didn't experience the other parts of the airport which are supposed to be quite impressive but nonetheless there is no reason such a sub-par section should exist in the international airport of such a wealthy country especially when it is part of the terminal dedicated to the flagship carrier of Abu Dhabi. One final word about Etihad. I flew economy class (""Coral"") and I did not find their service to be significantly better than say British Airways or Lufthansa. Actually I would rate British Airways economy class service as superior to Etihad.",5,0

abu-dhabi-airport,David Feehan,United Kingdom,Just returned from holiday which involved transiting at AUH. The boarding process at Terminal 3 is to say the least chaotic. Especially if your flight involves being bussed from the terminal to where your plane is parked and because of this (notwithstanding the tight connection times between a lot of Etihad flights) they never seem to leave on time. Facilities do leave a lot to be desired. With planned construction of a new terminal building you hope that issues such as being bussed to and from terminals (abnormal in today's era of international airports) and chaotic boarding are ironed out. I'm not that optimistic though.,4,0

abu-dhabi-airport,T Wainwright,United Kingdom,Absolutely ghastly airport - the worst I have visited bar none. None of my flights left on time with a minimum of 90 minutes delay - so other connections were missed. What is the point of having an exclusive Etihad Terminal 3 if you are always dropped off at Terminal 1 - especially since there is no information that you're actually in another Terminal. That's after a convoluted bus ride of at least 20 minutes. So many flights taking off mine - due to take off in 80 minutes - couldn't fit on the board so we were left to wander like the undead looking for information. The security queues were horrendous all 4 times with no organisation and plenty of attitude from ground staff. Took 2 hours to clear that on separate transfers. No obvious sign as business class that there was a separate queue for us and first though you wouldn't have been able to get through the throng of people lining up almost to Terminal 1. The lounge was heaving and unimpressive. The only thing I liked in Terminal 3 was the air- con that others dislike as by that point I was extremely hot from the stuffy overcrowded tunnel. It's not as though the Etihad hard product or customer service in the air is very good either so I will never willingly go through Abu Dhabi again. Avoid!,,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Marc De Baets,Belgium,I really did not like my stopovers going and coming back from Bangkok to Brussels. I do not understand why passengers on international flights must take a bus to go the terminal building (T1) or to go to the airplane from the new terminal 3. Toilets were difficult to find and not very clean. There is a lack of seats at the boarding gate and staff is not friendly. Avoid this airport if you want a relaxing transfer to your connecting flight.,2,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Ron Leliveld,Netherlands,This is a very good airport with good services. everything is good from gate to gate.

abu-dhabi-airport,J Carragher,Ireland,Terrible place considering the vast construction going on you would think it would be in order to provide a few seats for passengers to sit on. Information wise one hand does not seem to know what the other is doing. Gates change frequently and you need to be vigilant or you could easily miss a flight. T1 seating completely inadequate. Flight info boards not very prominent in such a crowded lounge and hard as it is to believe of the five international clocks the Abu Dhabi one was stopped. Gate 5 at T1 for Manila bound passengers is disgraceful. You have to sit on the floor then when the scanning starts everyone is herded into a small lounge which has space for about 80 people with half that amount of seating. Not very comfortable for the compliment of a 777.,2,0
abu-dhabi-airport,G Raj,United States,I had a stopover at this airport of 8 hours. It was so cold. Everyone was freezing. Airports should have normal temperatures! The 8 hours I spent there were horrible. Abu Dhabi airports expectation of peoples cold weather tolerance is pretty high.,5,0
abu-dhabi-airport,K Rees,Australia,"One of the worst airports I have ever had the misfortune to visit. It is simply chaotic a shambles.

Example 4th April Manchester flight signed as gate 51 - when you arrived there a man with a scruffy piece of paper said ""No now gate 29"". The food facilities and seating were of a very poor standard - it really is a third rate airport and that is being generous. Because of this I shall never fly Etihad again except I do have a return in July unfortunately.",,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Derek Salter,South Africa,Clear signage - was transferring from T1 to T3. Long walk but easy to find way and not too crowded. Security lines short and simple. Most of T3 seems to be focused on shopping. waiting area once at the gate spacious but no toilet facilities one you have entered these areas and had passport and ticket checked so do that before you get to gate. Seating area outside of gates limited. Facilities seemed clean and bright. Ground staff can be surly and not very competent and boarding procedures rather chaotic - no plan to board plane - just a dash to the plane!,7,1
abu-dhabi-airport,Mark Baker,United Kingdom,Abu Dhabi terminal 3 departure area is no bigger than a small shopping centre and does not have sufficient seating or toilet facilities for the hundreds of passengers who pass through and in the case of a recent flight which was delayed 36 hours it proved to be totally inadequate. We had a limited choice of food with only half of the vendors accepting the boarding passes for compensatory meals. Queues built up to almost half an hour waiting for some people many of whom had children. Anyone has had the misfortune to visit Abu Dhabi international terminal 1 they would know that it is a small cramped dirty and very unorganised place. There are insufficient chairs and dozens of passengers were sitting around the floor in corridors and food spillage was evident everywhere even after I motioned to a cleaner. Toilets are unclean and insufficient for the number of passengers. Abu Dhabi airport does look very impressive from the outside the duty free/shopping area looks smart and there is a good deal of high tech equipment but that's where it ends: it is small and cramped the staff are either incompetent or more likely badly trained by Etihad Airways communication with passengers is abysmal - PA announcements are limited and the display boards are very inaccurate. The Abu Dhabi Airport website is inaccurate and not kept up to date. Catering facilities would make a small village shopping centre look impressive - and they do not cater for either the volume of passengers or offer them much by way of choices; the idea of queuing in order to get into a departure gate lounge is pathetic at the least and our case they made passengers queue for over an hour just to get to this point. Overall rating - pathetic.,1,0
abu-dhabi-airport,M Buttle,United Kingdom,Transited twice recently through this Airport and on the first occasion it was a nightmare. I had been through once before luckily because you land at the old Terminal 1 something nobody tells you and have to find the small signs directing you to Terminal 3. It's not easy to find through the various food outlets etc. You enter what seems like the entrance to a very large Tube Station and following the signs for about twenty minutes however we had to queue for about 90 minutes to get through security for entrance to the gates in T3 . A complete nightmare with large groups of travellers milling around and making no progress whatsoever. The security gates in chaos with the personnel shouting pushing getting passengers to take off belts shoes etc. If your lucky enough to survive this you enter the shopping area. Small compared with Dubai. There are no enough seats and gates often have wrong information at the entrance plus be aware that the gates from 28/32 means that you will have a transit to your aircraft by bus. No enough seats toilets difficult to find and departure boards showing wrong gates. In short a total mess I wont ever be flying Etihad or transiting through AD again.,,0
abu-dhabi-airport,M Baughman,United States,This is really 2 airports connected by a long walk. The new terminal (3) is fairly modern but very bad and the old terminal (1) is awful. In T1 you have to queue past individualized security checkpoints into overcrowded waiting area pods. Sometimes several planes are leaving from the same pod and it can be incredibly chaotic. There is nowhere near enough seating. The food and shopping are ok for a small domestic airport bu not for an international hub. Judging by its looks Terminal 3 should be very nice but it has a lot of problems. You have to walk through duty free to get to gates and it is a congested maze. It is a 10-15 minute walk from the security point to the gates where the Etihad planes depart and they announce boarding long before boarding actually starts. Because of extra security there is not enough seating in the gate area for all the passengers so if you answer the boarding call you can find yourself sitting for 30-40 minutes waiting in an outer lounge for the gate lounge to empty so that you can get through security and onto the plane. If you're flying business class forget getting on early unless you like to push people over. Etihad staff work extremely hard to make the situation tolerable and AUH staff are very considerate and helpful. It seems that the design and management of this place make this a most undesirable place to transfer. Etihad's lounges are fair at best but way undersized for the traffic. Sometimes I have had to push my way in to get a chair. On the plus side Immigration Customs and Security staff have always been pleasant.,2,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Sebastian George,Australia,I've been through both Abu Dhabi and Dubai a few times. Etihad and Emirates as airlines provide nice services but I'd avoid Abu Dhabi airport if I had the choice. The airport is obviously striving for an upmarket feel but it's quite cramped the organisation and staff are somewhat lacking there's few opportunities for rest fresh air or natural light. The variety of food and facilities on offer is pretty limited too.,5,0
abu-dhabi-airport,David Roberts,United Kingdom,This is a new airport and its got to be the worst airport I have used it took almost 2 hours to get from our arrival gate to our new departure gate. The staff have no interest in helping you. How this airport works I have no idea its total chaos there is no organisation here. I will use Dubai or Doha in future.,,0
abu-dhabi-airport,P Asher,United Kingdom,Never flying Etihad again. Chaotic no information on the boards long queues for security with unfriendly staff shouting misleading instructions. Also on arrival I had to step over passengers sitting on the flight bridge (presumably they were waiting for the plane I arrived on?). It was the same on the return trip at a different time of day (01.00) so not attributable to a busy period.,,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Irfan Faiz,Malaysia,Had to go through security once more during transfer and the lines were ridiculously long. The airport is constantly crowded in the mornings and narrow hallways make it a lot worse. Toilet facilities could be a lot cleaner. Also I had to walk to the other end of the terminal to board my connecting flight because I disembarked via shuttle bus. Overall the airport feels somewhat inadequate to support the influx of travellers. If you are deeply concerned with time I would not suggest this airport as my flight was delayed by an hour because some passengers can't find their way to the gate.,3,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Gordon Walker,United Kingdom,We had to queue 90 mins to transfer flights make sure you have at least 3 hours between flights. It is the second time I have used this airport the first time I took it as a one off but both times have been a nightmare. I am glad my returns were not through Abu Dhabi. I think it will be Qatar in future.,,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Dave Smith,Kuwait,Avoid this airport at all costs. We were transiting through it and still had to go through security checks. The queue was approx 200m long and it took us around 2 hours to get through. The airport is overcrowded the corridors not wide enough and direction signs very poor.,,0
abu-dhabi-airport,H Kohl,Australia,I have been trough Abu Dhabi a few times. It is getting worse. Unfriendly people very long walk ways most Etihad flights don't use an aerobridge bus transfer. Small departure lounges with two gates very bad communication which flight is boarding bad signage. Even the people in the premium lounge were unfriendly. If you can avoid this airport.,1,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Maddox Arhambault,Canada,It is like a Shopping mall. The free wifi was welcome but was slow. The walk from my arrival gate to my departure gate was unending. Tiring. You really feel like lying down for sometime. The lack of food options near the gates is funny. Expensive food and Duty Free are a put off. Wonder why you go through a security check again when you are just transiting. Staff are usually unfriendly maybe it's a culture thing. Make money out of tired and miserable people is possibly the goal here. The flight to Mumbai was from a gate which did not have an aerobridge. Bus service from the Gate to the airplane reminded me of 1990s. The bus ride was a good 10minutes. Not impressed.,3,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Nadzri Mohd Alim,Malaysia,Avoid this Airport. I was in transit at this Airport twice. Once heading to Paris from KLIA and then on the return flight back to KLIA. Both transits were a major disappointment. Long walk from one terminal to the other. Poor signage. Only arrows pointing the gate numbers. Rude airport staff. Got yelled upon in Terminal 1 by Airport staff who told us to move on and not to group together in one area. Low ceiling which give you that choking feeling. Very hard airport seats very uncomfortable. Dirty toilets. Expensive food with limited number of food outlets. Limited number of duty free shop which are expensive with rude shop keepers. Airport staffs are not helping or clueless about their work. My flight got delayed for almost an hour on the Tarmac even though doors are closed and all passengers onboard. Avoid this airport.,2,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Vajahat Ali,Finland,It was my second time transferring flights at this airport. Sheer disappointment again after 2 years. Huge rush long queues and it seemed that nobody is taking care of passengers. I don't know why they don't have multiple gates or terminals to handle such situation. Also there are no sittings arrangements for the elderly or pregnant women. Etihad staff at airport were also not efficient. I suggest to avoid this airport and use Doha or Dubai as transferring city.,5,0
abu-dhabi-airport,M J Mathew,Qatar,Came here for a conference on a Qatar airways flight. The staff were rude lots of confusion as to who goes where especially since I had a hotel visa which I needed to get as a hard copy. No proper instructions. Taxis are not laid out well as we have to exit the airport and travel downstairs in the heat outside to get one.,1,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Maria Ioana,Romania,"Transited in Abu Dhabi twice in August and September 2013. It's one of the cleanest with helpful staff. It is indeed chilly but other than that it's easy to get around and you really do have everything you need there even if you are ""trapped"" inside for more than 10 hours like I was. Oh and there's also free Wi-Fi and comfy chairs with blankets which can make your ""stay"" a whole lot easier.",9,1
abu-dhabi-airport,Nabil Al Atassi,Czech Republic,I have been using this airport for many years. Terminal 1 (old) used by most airlines is overloaded with poor services and only one poorly attended bathroom. Terminal 3 used exclusively by Etihad is a bit larger but again operating beyond its design capacity; with only three bathrooms and cheap cleaning contractor cleanliness is an issue mainly if you want to use the cabinets. Abu Dhabi is trying to imitate Dubai's success but apparently without success. Amongst the three major hubs in the area Dubai Doha (till the opening of new airport end of this year) and Abu Dhabi Dubai remains the best. If you have a choice then avoid this airport.,4,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Varghese Mathai,United States,I transited through Abu Dhabi (onward and return) on the Chicago-Abu Dhabi-Mumbai route last month. The airport seemed to be too confusing and crowded with no proper signboards guiding you to the different terminals. All you see is gate numbers and you have to somehow know which terminal contains which gate numbers. Queues are pretty long and no airport official to guide/manage these queues. If you are travelling with infants remember that AUH doesn't have any sort of priority for such passengers. So you'll have to wait in the queues for hours. Airport staff especially at the ticket/transfer desks are unprofessional rude and have an indifferent attitude. I had booked a bassinet seat for my 10-month old baby but was told at Mumbai airport to try for the seat at AUH since most of the seats were taken. On checking at the transfer desk in Terminal 3 the guy at the counter lied and said that I already have bassinet seats only to realize otherwise when I boarded the Abu Dhabi-Chicago flight (15 hrs journey). Seats at departure gates are very few narrow and not comfortable. Overall not a world class airport as it is projected to be. Its really disappointing and should be avoided if you are travelling with infants/kids.,1,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Dean Hone,Australia,I recently travelled to Europe through Abu Dhabi and to be honest I was less than impressed. My main concern would be that the terminal lacks staff and desks to process the amount of guests coming though at any one time. (Inbound and Out). On our return journey the customs software went down (Aug 2013) which happens but the time to get the system back up and operating was extremely slow (2 hrs). With major events like the Grand Prix coming up I really hope they ramp things up to accommodate for the crowds expected. Just small things like customs staff wearing iPhone headsets under their head dress and they have absolutely no interest in being welcoming at all. Then the Taxi system waiting outside was totally out of control there were no lines or order to the process the waiting passengers it was every man for himself with Taxi's at one stage 3 deep across the road with people walking around moving cars. Appalling would be a word that comes to mind.,,0
abu-dhabi-airport,J Lynn,United Kingdom,I am sitting in Abu Dhabi airport and can't believe I am in same place as other reviewers. I agree it is a bit chilly but not uncomfortably spans it is 02.00. The staff have all been very polite and helpful all public areas are very clean and tidy and toilets are spotless with attendants sweeping out cubicles unformatted each use. I can genuinely see no problem here whatsoever.,8,1
abu-dhabi-airport,K Morrison,United Arab Emirates,"Avoid this airport. Toilets are digesting not enough toilets rude immigration staff who are lazy and slow - would seem that they take delight in seeing how long they can take to process people. We waited for 3 hours at 2.00am to be processed while ""security"" were escorting others to the front of the huge lines - so lines were not moving at all! The signage boards and sequencing of services does not exist or work. Food options are limited expensive and disappointing. Same goes for shopping. This airport does not cut it amongst the international airports and we have travelled in many. We are regular travels into and out of Abu Dhabi and at least 90 percent of our flights leave at least an hour late. It is normal practice for us to sit on a plane for over an hour prior to it taking off. It is also normal practice for Etihad to wait for late guests who just dawdle in. It is also normal for passengers to try and swap seats like their choosing from an a-la-carte menu - we have been asked to swap seats with these passengers by the flight attendants even though we have taken the trouble to check-in early and secure our preferred seats. This airport truly is unbelievable - masquerading with a veneer of shine that very quickly loses its gloss when you try to do anything.",,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Yvette Giannake,Australia,I found this airport quite unpleasant. This is my second stopover here and I've found the staff unhelpful and uninformative. Our flight has now been delayed by 50 minutes without explanation the toilets are gross and the air con doesn't work in there and they took my water when I went into the waiting area for my flight despite my having just bought it 5 minutes earlier on my way from the previous flight. In future I will avoid this airport.,3,0
abu-dhabi-airport,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,I've been through AUH several times in recent years it's always been at night and it's always very busy. This time I had a tight daytime connection (1hr 20 mins) and the inbound flight was 1hr late. Not a problem - the airport was extremely quiet at 9am no queues at all in Security and Etihad held the connecting flight until all the transit passengers had boarded. All very civilized and not at all like short connections in Dubai.,7,1
abu-dhabi-airport,C Heidtmann,South Africa,Had a connecting flight from SA to Dubai and Dubai to London. Airport was fine but very busy. Had to walk quite far to find information boards. Not enough toilets for the amount of passengers also not enough seating areas. Long walk to the boarding gate.,5,0
abu-dhabi-airport,A Cooper,Australia,The airport was clean with average facilities but the reason for the low score is the queue time at immigration. I got off my flight at 2am having flown business class into Abu Dhabi. There were 30 immigration counters open each with at least 60 people queuing. The process was so slow with staff leisurely processing customers at a rate of 3 minutes per person that it took 3 hours to get through. There were people complaining all around and the people stamping the passports seemed to be operating 'in their own time' which was extremely slow interspersed with conversation and joke breaks between counters.,2,0
abu-dhabi-airport,S Humayun,United States,"Yesterday I spent about 18 hours at this airport. Too many people coming and going through this airport but it doesn't has enough facilities to handle them. There are very few bathrooms with missing lights and toilet rolls. Some has faucets which don't work. Because of huge number of people that used them there aren't enough people to keep them clean. It took me 50 minutes to get visa as only 4 immigration booths were open. Also there are not many people who speak English to guide/direct travellers. Signs are clearly marked but information on monitors is not always correct. For example my flight was at 1.45am and around 12am monitors started showing ""Last Call"". My flight got delayed to 2.45am. Though monitors at airport showed flight delayed but at 1.45am started showing that flight was closed. Also gate information wasn't correct and that upset many people.",3,0
abu-dhabi-airport,M Eggleton,United Kingdom,I travelled with Etihad from Melbourne to London. I don't know what terminal I was in but I wasn't that impressed. It was quite small and confusing. Lots of staff telling people where to go and you could quite easily go the wrong way and miss your connection. Facilities were ok but I was only there for half an hour so didn't use them or any of the shops. It could certainly do with improvement.,6,0
abu-dhabi-airport,J Monsen,Denmark,A transfer airport to avoid. I travelled from Turkey to Australia with a stop-over in Abu Dhabi and it was not a pleasant experience. Apparently 1.5 hrs hour is not enough to catch your flight - unless it's delayed which mine (luckily) were. It took about 25-30 minutes to get out of the plane onto a bus and drive to the airport. Then you had to walk to the transfer gates and stand in line for another 30-40 minutes for another security check meaning you are left running for your gate because boarding closes 20 minutes prior to take-off. You do not get to skip line because boarding for your flight had already started - quite frankly they make a huge deal out of stressing the difference between economy and first class passengers - only the latter are treated nicely. The information boards are not updated so only once I had arrived at the gate was I told that the plane would be delayed. At that point you're stuck in a gate with no access to any facilities. On the plus side there is free wifi but that's about it. I have no idea what any of the facilities in the airport was like.,2,0
abu-dhabi-airport,S Vandendriessche,Belgium,We just got off the plane from Brussels. Everything looks new however services and information are below par! One expects some kind of way to see which gate your connecting flight is at. In addition to that: our flight had an inexplicable delay of more than 2hrs 20mins for which no apologies or information was shown at the gate. One upside: free wifi.,4,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Michael Buttle,United Kingdom,Landed at T1 instead of 3 found airport to be confusing after speaking to transfer staff found tunnel to T3 long walk allow plenty of time T3 badly designed with lack of information on flight departure boards very confusing with code sharing flights constantly changing far too quickly toilets down stairs from departure gate shops not stocking all brands of cigarettes/drinks. Poor boarding procedure. I know Dubai is very busy but it's a much better designed and constructed airport. I shall not be rushing back to Abu Dhabi.,3,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Bob Stanbrook,Australia,Airport is nothing special but not unpleasant. However every time I have been through this airport (three times) my luggage has ended up somewhere else! Don't know what is wrong with the luggage handling at this hub but it is not working.,3,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Philip Loveder,Australia,Abu Dhabi Airport isn't the most appealing of the world's airports but does have some virtues. The duty free stores are well stocked and the upper level food hall adequate enough. However (and this has been pointed out in previous reviews ad nauseum) the air-conditioning is just far to cold for normal passenger comfort. Virtually everyone had blankets over them while waiting for flights! The flight information boards are quite inadequate and even flights scheduled less than an hour from departure may not make it to the board. Seating is limited outside the direct gate areas.,5,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Harold Bush-Howard,United Kingdom,A very unpleasant airport. I connected from London to Bangkok thinking it would be a nice experience to travel via a Gulf airport as so many people are doing the same. Never again. It was bad enough dealing with ghastly food on Etihad. The food options at Terminal 3 are limited and very expensive. Also the fast food on display looked as though it was there 48 hours before. Not very pleasant at around 20 dollars for a similar meal which In London would cost less than half. A small bottle of water cost around 6 US dollars. Not many places to sit but lots of shops. Abu Dhabi makes Frankfurt and Paris look charming clean and efficient for transiting. Never again.,2,0
abu-dhabi-airport,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,Been a couple of years since I last travelled through AUH and nothing much has changed - completely useless flight information screens poor choice of duty-free goods and eating options and absolutely brutal air conditioning. On the plus side the airport is built on a human scale and is easy to transit through there's plenty seating and access to clean toilets (things that Dubai fails badly on). For me it's currently the best transit airport in the region.,7,1
abu-dhabi-airport,Andrew Reid,Egypt,Three and a half hour transit for CAI-AUH-MEL in terminal 3 only. Coldest airport ever! AC is set so high we had to get our jumpers out. Very spacious clean and lots of seats. Kid's play area is ok but mostly for under 6's and just a few cars and a play house. Free wi-fi and computer terminals. Not much to do for that length of wait - as a transit point it needs more activities. Also even though departure gate was directly next to arrival gate we had to walk to the other end of the terminal to the arrivals area clear security and then walk back again to the departure gate.,5,1
abu-dhabi-airport,Mark Wilkins,United Kingdom,Transfer from MAN to BKK. As a Silver member of an Etihad guest I can access the Al Reem lounge which is a big plus apart from duty free not a lot of things to do apart from free wifi. However as previous travellers note at peak times the security clearance for transit passengers can be very poor - I saw the longest line yet all the way back to T1 nearly on the way out but no queue at all for the return flight. Like a lot of other airports need to plan better for peak periods early morning early evening - if they do this it would get a lot better reviews.,7,1
abu-dhabi-airport,T Patel,United Kingdom,"One of the worst airport I have ever crossed so far. We landed at Gate 34 to catch a connecting flight at Gate 17. After walking 20 minutes I came across a big banner ""Gate 17"" and there is no gate underneath! After catching somebody with airport badge came to know that its closed and have to go through Gate 1415 and 16 to go to Gate 17! Once inside there is no water no toilets and highly inadequate seats for 5 gates in that area! No electronic board showing which flight on which gate anything. If you need water go back to the main mall area and then again come back via security checks! Even worse for the families. First time I came across a situation where families are told to seat while they send across single and passengers without kids to the aircraft and 5 minutes into the bus boarding activity airport officials realized there are no additional bus and they sent the families in the same congested bus!! As far as possible I will not travel again via Abu Dhabi. One mistake is enough.",1,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Saira Khan,Canada,The airport has come a long way but travel through AUH is still a rude awakening for many people. There needs to be better management and more thought put into the finer details. My biggest complaint is about the process (time delays) for eye scanning that passengers are put through. Management needs to realize that when there is a line with 100 arrival passengers but only one employee working this is extremely inefficient and irresponsible. There is no one monitoring this section of the airport so you'll have people who are impatient pushing and going through to the front of the line. In this section of the airport there is no seating for passengers after a long flight. People are left waiting for hours just waiting with no fans or air conditioning! After speaking to many people who have also flown through AUH and DXB they have said the experience left a negative outlook regarding travel to UAE.,4,0
abu-dhabi-airport,F Brusse,Australia,Very unimpressed! My husband and I arrived in Abu Dhabi after a 14 hr flight from Australia. The airport is chaotic staff are fairly brusque and not helpful and there is nowhere to get a shower. In addition the Al Reem lounge was advertised as being accessible to certain MasterCard holders. The fine print as we were told at said lounge's check-in counter is that this is only for cards issued from Africa and the Middle East. Alternative option is the airport hotel which only rents rooms for the day. The place gives the impression of giving the ups to ordinary mortals like myself who travel economy. When compared to other airports like Singapore Seoul Hong Kong Tokyo Osaka Bangkok this place leaves a huge amount to be desired. Won't be flying Etihad again if I can avoid it.,2,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Kurt Mueller,United Kingdom,MAN-AUH-DAC. Arrived at T1 Gate 7 and my onward flight was on the same aircraft at the same gate some 90 minutes later. You can't beat that for convenience. T1 is clearly more cramped than T3 which I have used before and I found the ATMs hard to locate without directions from staff. Ironically before opening up the scanners at Gate 7 the security team there used the passenger waiting area as location for their smoking break - in direct view of the no-smoking notices. Makes you wonder about their professionalism.,7,1
abu-dhabi-airport,Ahmed Zuhairi,United Arab Emirates,Terminal 1 has now been refurbished and has a fresh and spacious feel to it. The new First/Business Class lounge is excellent for food quality beverages cleanliness showers etc. For a long stop over pay the lounge price for a good meal and relaxing time. Immigration takes no more than 5 minutes. Taxi's plentiful outside.,9,1
abu-dhabi-airport,Kurt Mueller,United Kingdom,My first transit at AUH from DAC to MAN. Arrived at T3 with about 70 minutes between flights. As my departing flight also left from T3 the walking distance involved was refreshingly short. No queues at security. Only back-up was at document checkpoint at the gate. If you don't want to be forced to go through the duty free shop simply use the toilets after security as they have a second exit that leads to the gate concourse. My connecting flight left from a remote stand necessitating a relatively short bus transfer. All together a smooth and comfortable transit experience.,8,1
abu-dhabi-airport,M Taylor,United Kingdom,Through AUH to BAH. Arrived at a remote stand and bussed to Terminal. Clear signage made it easy to navigate along with plenty of Departure screens. As previously stated quite busy so seating can be a bit hit and miss but they can be found. However after 7 hours in the air a walk about was most welcome. Boarding through Gate 18 was bizarre a doorway that actually led to Gate 17 and 18. Even weirder was that two flights were through this door at the same time which led to confusion for passengers. Security was a drag with two flights passing through one metal detector and two x-ray machines. They got it sorted and we were bussed to another remote stand. Return was at night. Arrived at another remote stand and again a bus to the Terminal. I was travelling with an infant access to a stroller would have been advantageous at the gate. Upon arriving at Flight Transfer we found a fleet of strollers. Why position them here? A reasonably long walk down to Gate 34 (10 mins) with plenty of seating at the Gate in a clean and airy environment. Overall not a bad experience. Terminal 1 is rather dated but great for people watching and shopping. Terminal 3 is modern and bright but can involve a fair trek down to the Gates in the 30's. Be prepared is my advice. Roll with it as it can be busy and perhaps not follow the norm expected of some western airports.,8,1
abu-dhabi-airport,Michael Owenir,United Arab Emirates,Very bad experience with this airport definitely will never travel again through it. Very bad attitude from immigration staff. E-gates rarely working and no one there to help.,5,0
abu-dhabi-airport,B Lynch,Vietnam,AUH even though it has a 'new terminal' is seriously deficient in the security area where queues can stretch back along the moving walkways/escalators. Their Etihad airport lounge is cramped and uncomfortable and the free internet stations in the terminal usually on 60% operational.,3,0
abu-dhabi-airport,D Salter,South Africa,A bit unsure given the previous views here. But very pleased. Excellent signage super staff easy transfer good food and duty free. Seating is limited but sufficient. Announcements clear and sufficient. Boarding easy and painless. Much better than I had expected and would be happy to recommend the airport for anyone transferring. I used terminal 3 only - I cannot review terminal 1.,10,1
abu-dhabi-airport,G Gold,Australia,Transited through Abu Dhabi to and from Europe on a recent trip. Terminal Three is very modern and clean but badly laid out and crowded. Security was quick but the duty free area was very small. It states on the airport website that there are showers. When I arrived I found that the showers were the equivalent to the ones in changing rooms. How are passengers supposed to know to bring their own towel/soap etc. The customer service is very inefficient. I was redirected several times when asking for the gate for my flight to Larnaca.,5,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Brian Coulson,United Kingdom,MAN-AUH-MEL return. Passed through T3 on the outward leg but had to switch from T3 to T1 on the return. Both Terminals were clean and bright with good facilities. Seating is at a premium but was to be found. The only frustration was that we arrived and left from adjacent gates in T3 on our outward leg but had to walk miles at the upper level to go through security to descend to the lower departure level. The only reason for this that I could see was to ensure that you went through the duty-free shopping area. The return arrangements meant we had to switch from T3 to T1 but staff were on hand to direct you and it was all quite painless. My first experience of UAE and I would not hesitate to use the airport again.,9,1
abu-dhabi-airport,K J Walsh,Australia,I found the signage between Terminal 1 and 3 to be very poor with no indication of which terminal certain flights depart from. Not enough toilets in T3 is another issue however free internet was a bonus though.,3,0
abu-dhabi-airport,R Thompson,United Arab Emirates,Appalling experience in Terminal 1. There was no restaurants operating. The only food/drink outlet Starbucks was overwhelmed and ran out of most food items. Seating inadequate.,1,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Nelson Yap,Australia,Hot muggy 34 degrees at 2am in the morning and no Air conditioning. We felt like we were in a sauna. Plus I don't understand why we need to go through about 3 separate security points when on a connecting flight. 1 is fine but 3? We haven't left the airport we just got off the plane and we are going on a connecting flight and we were already screened at Heathrow which has very strict security protocols. The wifi is slower than dial up Internet. Terminal 1 is weird the whole place from floor to ceiling is tiled like a bathhouse no windows. Terminal 3 is better because it is modern with floor to ceiling glass so it feels open. I don't know what Abu Dhabi will do to improve their staff because they aren't friendly helpful.,2,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Alison Hemming,United Kingdom,Was impressed with the staff at T3 I have always found that a smile helps. I was treated with courtesy at all times - even passport control officer wished me a pleasant stay. Upon departure there was a long queue for economy check in and I was asked if I would like to check in on the First Class desk to save me waiting.,5,0
abu-dhabi-airport,P Vinnakota,United States,The airport is small overcrowded and needs improvement. The seating is limited. At some gates if you clear the security then you cannot use the restrooms! The air conditioning was barely adequate for the heat and the crowds. The signage is poor. The signs are parallel to the gates but one walks perpendicular to those signs. The staff were a bit gruff and impatient.,3,0
abu-dhabi-airport,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,Passed through a couple of times - T1 to T3 connection and another connection within T3. 2 hour connections both ways so no problems. T1 is a crowded dump. Signage is poor in both terminals and T3 is a 10-minute walk. Transit Security seemed pretty disorganised but only took a few minutes. T3 had plenty Duty Free Shops with prices similar to DXB. Eating options were adequate and no problems finding toilets. Air conditioning was a bit brutal and there appeared to be plenty of cold people in the middle of the night. Biggest criticism for me were the dreadful flight information screens which are tiny and only covered departures up to 45 minutes ahead - you didn't know which gate to go to and the single information desk wasn't even manned. On balance I think I prefer AUH to DXB for a 2 hour transit - at least AUH is built on a human scale.,3,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Stephen Taynton,Kazakhstan,"I have used this airport on a number of occssions but until recently did not see how bad it is. I usually go from the plane to the transit hotel to the lounge and then to the plane. But this time I was unfortunately travelling economy and experience the nightmare of Abu Dhabi - it is just a bad airport with staff not really knowing what they are doing saying ""yes you can find a trolley around the corner"" I nearly walked to London and did not find one. The transfer between terminals is a nightmare with no rationale between what you should do - and with the upgrading in Terminal One the problem is worse. And don't get me started on the rude staff who are the transit hotel. Avoid this airport for your sanity alone.",2,0
abu-dhabi-airport,E Andrean,United Kingdom,"On arrival at Abu Dhabi airport from Heathrow we were shocked to see a small area of poor quality overcrowded seating and just a shabby very expensive cafe. Other than this there were some duty free shops. There was a general shortage of toilet facilities. All very depressing when you know you will be spending 6 hours there on your return journey. Etihad might have nice lounges for business and first class passengers but these facilities are not available to economy class passengers. The security check point for transfer passengers was heaving with queues of people and we found it very confusing. When I reached the front of the queue they sent me away because I was missing a tag? On our return journey we paid to use the ""Hotel Lounge"" which was worth every penny.",2,0
abu-dhabi-airport,T Neyrinck,Belgium,T3 is bright clean with speedy security and passport controls. The transit zone before/between flights is not a place to spend more than 2 hours (limited choice of food and shops) but not a bad experience either. T1 is in an another league: old and worn okay for arriving at but not a nice place to depart from. All in all a basic but efficient airport as long as you pass through T3.,3,0
abu-dhabi-airport,A Stevenson,United Kingdom,Transfer at AUH from LHR enroute to CMB and on return journey. Arrival at AUH Terminal 3 - this is the first time in many years I'd passed through Abu Dhabi and T3 was new to me. Fairly typical modern airport terminal - clean spacious lots of steel and glass. 10 minute walk to Terminal 1 for connecting flight - while still architecturally eye catching showing its age and feeling a bit sticky. 10 or so free internet terminals several of which weren't working. On the return flight we taxied to a remote stand and were bussed to a gate close to terminal 1. Long layover of 6.5 hours. While deciding what to do I was approached by a friendly airport employee who explained my options including (as a UK passport holder) the option to pass through immigration and leave the airport if I so wished. In the end decided to find somewhere quiet to try and catch up with my sleep. Rather than proceed to my departure gate I went up the elevator to the arrivals floor and walked back towards terminal 3. Limited seating en-route and no facilities other than toilets but very quiet and I was largely undisturbed for several hours. I noticed a room full of seating close to the transfer desk. Approaching departure time I made my way back to the departures level and through security (peculiarly I don't remember needing to do this on the outward leg). Once through security the route inevitably winds it's way through a huge shopping area before reaching the T3 departure gates. As is the case with T1 there were several free internet terminals. Plentiful seating at the gates themselves.,3,0
abu-dhabi-airport,H Mel by,Norway,"Terminal 1 is horrendous in every way and spending any more than 1 hour there is excruciating. A few days ago I had a 5-hour layover in Abu Dhabi airport not knowing which terminal the departure would be from upon landing. Knowing what terminal 1 was like I feared the worst. Thankfully it was from the new T3 which is a huge improvement. I must say the ""most improved airport"" award that AUH has gotten is really deserved. T3 has plenty of shops plenty of places to eat (which is severely lacking in T1) and plenty of computers with free internet (there were never any lines). It is also clean and looks very modern with actual windows unlike the old terminal. Staff were also quite friendly. When looking at the departure board a staff member immediately approached me and asked me where I was travelling and directed me towards the appropriate gate. I wont mind transiting through this airport for future journeys as long as it is through T3.",4,0
abu-dhabi-airport,S Montavanio,Italy,The new Terminal 3 is a huge improvement on Terminal 1 with upgraded facilities and overall good passenger experience. Not much to complain about other than the limited seating provided for passengers at T1 and then some rude abrupt and unfriendly police at security checkpoints who has the ability to make any traveller feel most unwelcome for using this airport for travelling purposes.,3,0
abu-dhabi-airport,K Guest,Germany,After a 14+ hour flight I was looking forward to getting a hot shower and a relaxing nap in the airport hotel or at least in one of the pay-for-service lounges during my 8 hour layover. We landed in the new terminal (3?) and whilst at first glance its nice clean and new looking I soon discovered there were very few directional signs no shower facilities no airport hotel or lounge facilities (unless you're Etihad silver or gold member) hardly anywhere to sit nothing to do at all except buy duty free items or line up for 30 minutes of free internet and finding an open information desk was a huge achievement. I was eventually told I would have to go back though security and walk over to the old terminal if I wanted a shower but after having dealt with the rude security staff I declined. Its a real pity that the new terminal is so poorly outfitted will make me seriously reconsider flying Etihad if I have a long layover again.,2,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Matthew Naz,Australia,I am surprised at how a major airport hub like AUH could run with no facilities what so ever apart from the free internet. I had a very long 12 hour transit in AUH en-route to Cairo from Sydney and was ashamed at the service of facilities. I admit the new terminal 3 is a big push into the skies from the old terminal 1 but there's still more pushing up to do if they want passengers to enjoy their transit in AUH. I have also departed and arrived in AUH and would give them a thumbs up at the services offered during departure and arrival but check in is a nightmare with all Etihad flights checking in from the same line of desks.,3,0
abu-dhabi-airport,R Watson,United States,Part of an airport's ranking and reviews should depend on how they deal with a medical emergency. I was flying from AUH 2 weeks ago and a passenger in his late 50's dropped to the floor in the duty free. It took almost 15 minutes for a doctor to arrive at which point the passenger had died. A person approached the airport manager about this delay and was told if he did not mind his business he would be detained by the police. Abu Dhabi airport is tiny compared to other major airports where medical staff reach the scene within 3 minutes.,2,0
abu-dhabi-airport,M Baughman,United States,Etihad staff nice but the equipment is dysfunctional. Then there's all the back and forth between the new terminal that is fairly nice and the old terminal which is a dump with a glittery paint job. There are some pluses though: a special business/first class check-in in a separate space and a dedicated immigration officer that covers all airlines. One staffer there was kind enough to go track down a lost sketchbook for me after I had already gone through immigration. The business lounge for BA and other airlines was too small for the number of flights served at peak.,3,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Geoffrey Wyndham-Jones,Kuwait,In transit only although a change of terminals was required in both directions. Terminal 1 is the old terminal which is short on seating although architecturally interesting with the tiled mushroom in the centre. However seating is limited food choice is limited and the place is kept over-airconditioned. Terminal 3 is the new terminal and is more spacious with better facilities and a greater choice of eating places: if you are in transit it may be better to stay in Terminal 3 until an hour before your flight and then head across to Terminal 1. Security for transfer passengers changing terminals is reasonable with plenty of space and barriers to direct passengers. I was quite impressed.,5,0
abu-dhabi-airport,S Abrams,United Kingdom,Transited AUH both ways. Modern airport with what seems like miles to walk from arrival gate to security and back to departure gate. Long queue for transit security. Usual duty free shops but not very cheap. Free wi-fi signal very weak in food court area. Smell of tobacco smoke everywhere despite the airport being non-smoking in public areas the sliding doors to the smoking booths do not close fully allowing the smoke and smell to permeate through into the rest of the airport.,3,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Bill Jones,Canada,"Arrived from LHR on BA at 8pm. Slightly amused by the ""greeter"" in local arab dress at the gate welcoming deplaning passengers. Didn't have the personality for it I suppose. Walked through aquarium-like central area (lime green and blue tiles) and off to surly immigration. All our information was manually entered into a computer painfully slowly (key-by-key) and then collected baggage. Was a pretty quick once past immigration though crowded. Airport also appeared to have the lingering smell of cigarette smoke. Airport seemed very crowded and is probably going to be expanded at some point. Car to city was as expected. Airport was not what you'd expect from an oil-rich city-state.",3,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Farouk Mogheth,Czech Republic,Flying through Abu Dhabi (Bangkok to Munich and back). Both flights with Etihad gave me only 2 hours transit. It was a nice experience from and to my destination. The new part of the terminal was clean crowd free and easy to navigate through. I guess I was lucky to bypass the rush hour. WCs clean fair amount of shopping and a couple of food venues. Security fast and efficient. A good airport to fly through.,5,0
abu-dhabi-airport,P Sims,United Kingdom,In and out of Terminal 3 this week. Very poor facilities for food and drink. In duty free I looked at cameras and Ipods. Both seemed expensive and on checking my preferred items they are cheaper on the UK High Street than so called duty free in Abu Dhabi. Buyer beware!,2,0
abu-dhabi-airport,A Patel,United Kingdom,The view of this airport may depend on what terminal you arrive and depart from. I was a transiting passenger at the new Terminal 3. This is a terminal with plenty of seating internet access points and adequate duty free. Security was quick and easy and the terminal had plenty of toilets which were clean. I'm not sure what the rest of the airport is like but if you are travelling through Terminal 3 it was a very pleasant experience.,4,0
abu-dhabi-airport,J Carters,,I had the unfortunate pleasure of having a lay-over at AUH airport Terminal 1 a while ago. The place is small and it was ridiculously crowded and there was no place to sit anywhere. It was in general a very uncomfortable experience with a smoking area so disgusting that even after a 7h flight into AUH I passed up on the chance to smoke. I was glad to just go to the gate (located in between the shops) and wait there. Once the security check was starting it was a men-first situation and the women had to wait until the men had passed through. It was the flimsiest security check I have ever had the metal detectors were beeping quite often but everyone was waved through anyway. Never been happier to get onto a crowded plane just to get away from there.,1,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Fiona Cameron,,Terminal 3 may be more unique than Terminal 1 which is like any terminal anywhere in the world admittedly Terminal 1 is more spacious which is a plus and there were numerous powerpoints which I saw a family use to plug in the portable DVD player to keep the kids happy. There were computers in Terminal 1 with free internet access which helped pass the time on my overnight stopover. Security checkpoints were not as traumatic as I expected and all in all it was as bad as I was dreading.,3,0
abu-dhabi-airport,R Bath,,Just a transiting passenger both directions. New terminal is a vast improvement although long walks are required and it's kind of boring. Old terminal building with its interesting but terrifying decor is a shocker. Advice: Toilets upstairs are far better than those downstairs (the worst I've ever seen at any airport). Coming back Business Class lounge and transfer hotel OK.,3,0
abu-dhabi-airport,A Newton,,A lot better since the new terminal 3 has opened. a lot more spacious and even at their busiest time between 11am - 3pm not a problem. a few duty free shops and places to grab something to eat. not bad at all compared to T1.,4,0
abu-dhabi-airport,P Nixon,,A fine airport with all the mod cons if a little cramped for the volume of customers currently using it. The unique architecture is a welcome break from the beige and glass structures so common in modern airports and although the facilities are spartan they fulfil the purpose. The staff are heplful and pleasant with the exception of security. However I've had far more unpleasant experiences with security personnel at other transit hubs in the region these guys should are par for the course.,4,0
abu-dhabi-airport,S Pathirana,,Having the displeasure of using this airport a couple of times I have now preferred using Dubai and that is saying something. Extremely dull airport ridiculously tacky terminal which has no space at all. Can get very crowded. Toilets are horrid. There's been talk of expansion and the little expansion that has happened is barely noticeable (more check-in counters at departure). Rude officials at arrivals and I have had my bag searched every time I have come through here. Etihad is a nice airline to fly and it's a shame that it is served through this sad excuse for an airport.,1,0
abu-dhabi-airport,J Song,,I had to go through this airport during my flight from KUL to DUB. Inbound at 8-45pm and outbound at 2-55am - horrible. It took me 30mins from bus to the terminal and once the bus had set down the crowd of people in the bus were lost - where was the exit? The alley used to enter the terminal was also used to go on board and there were no signs dividers. We managed to find our way through by asking for directions to other passengers who were going onboard. As for the terminal itself like all reviews below avoid it at all costs. No seats and if any very uncomfortable seats plus annoying announcements every minute - it gets more annoying if you can't find a place to sit. The duty free shops are a rip-off too. It takes 10 mins to get around the airport and with its dome shape and tiles on the walls the noise echoes throughout and with the announcements its a nightmare! The security checks were over- secured and literally for every passenger they took about 5 mins to interview asking why did you transit in AUH why are you going there how long did you stay in your destination etc.,1,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Pasindu Karunaratne,,Hanging around in any airport is to be avoided and in Abu Dhabi all the more so. It is a deeply boring place to have to spend any time there being nothing much to do. The seating – what there is of it – is comfortable. The airport seems tiny. The mosaic dome makes a change but it allows voices to echo so is noisy. This is exacerbated by the continual – and I mean continual – announcements which are also impossible to understand. There is a Costa so you can get a good cup of coffee and pay in £ if you wish. I didn’t particularly notice the smoke that so many people have complained of. Crowd control is southern ie long queues and lengthy processes. The toilets are reasonably unpleasant. Shopping is very limited to the usual Duty Free fare of watches perfumes cigars and alcohol. There are no quiet places to sleep so if you have an 8 hour stop-over during the night as I did you are going to have little fun. You can get a little sleep on the carpeted floor in the passages to the gates. All in all an experience that is not recommended.,1,0
abu-dhabi-airport,S Sharma,,Etihad was a pleasant experience travelling between Sydney and Manchester but the stopover in Abu Dhabi was a big disapointment. Had 2 hours to spend here in either direction and found the airport to be small crowded noisy and smelling of cigarette smoke. Finding a seat and getting comfortable was next to impossible and hearing the announcements over the humdrum was difficult too. Hopefully the new terminals and expansions will do justice to the airline that the airport serves.,1,0
abu-dhabi-airport,T Vincent,,I flew with Etihad from BRU to BKK with a 2 hours stopover in AUH. At first sight I found the terminal quite original and nice (the green mosaic); but tiny and really overcrowded. The terminal is non smoking but this is theory as it smells cigarette smoke everywhere. In fact there are smoking areas in bars but no smoke extractor so the whole terminal looks like a smoking room. Going from the 2nd floor to the 1st one using the stairs is hazardous as smoking is not prohibited in the piano bar between the 2 floors. Toilets are on the 1st floor. There look really old fashioned and are not so clean (lot of water on the ground). So what to do when you are in transit? There are 3 bars/snacks but it's almost impossible to find a seat. Prices for drinks are OK. Not so many duty free areas. Ideal for short stopovers as it takes only 5 minutes to go from one gate to another but probably the worst airport I've ever seen for people in transit. I expected much better for a city like Abu Dhabi.,1,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Pasindu Karunaratne,,I went through this airport a few weeks back on my way to London from Abu Dhabi on Qatar Airways and to be honest it is one of the most disgusting airports I have been through. My flight was at around 11:30 pm and the airport was crowded and finding a place to sit was out of the question. It is way too cramped and crowded. It is a real shame that a fast developing country like the UAE does not have a decent airport to go through it is not as if Dubai is any better.,1,0
abu-dhabi-airport,Steve Unsworth,,I have travelled through Abu Dhabi between London and South East Asia several times over the last few months. A layover here is as recorded elsewhere deeply unpleasant when it is overcrowded (typically 10pm to 2am). Use Qatar or Emirates to their hubs rather than Etihad. The only good thing I have to report is that a critical comment left in their suggestion box stimulated an e-mail apology and promise of better things post the completion of new facilities which arrived before I got back home 12 hours later!,2,0
abuja-airport,Alan Wan,United Kingdom,On arrival as we flew Business Class we were near the front of the line for immigration. Baggage did not take too long to arrive. Finding a taxi was not obvious but a friendly airport employee walked us across the car park to the taxis - make sure you agree a price in advance. When we departed Abuja although it was quiet and there was no one in front it still took an hour to check-in. Bags had to be x-rayed and PAX go through a metal detector bags then manually weighed and manually searched after which we could check- in. Due to a computer crash boarding cards were manually written - however ground staff later gave out printed cards at the gate. The business lounge was rubbish but at least the sofas were comfy. At the gate all passengers and bags were searched again - by very friendly staff.,6,0
abuja-airport,A Cobo,United States,Abuja international arrivals greets you with a long immigration line. Only one booth is set up to accommodate a complete flight with another booth for dignitaries and diplomats. One can stand for over 1 hour in this line while the immigration clerk scrutinizes your passport and visa. The people are generally nice and polite the airport is clean. AC is mediocre. International departure was crowded and not very comfortable and in most places extremely hot. Food options are limited. Abuja national terminal is another story. Very hot limited seating not so clean limited food options and crowded. There are no flight departure screens. In general an unkempt image.,2,0
abuja-airport,Antonio Tettamanzy,Brazil,It was better than expected but can be quite messy sometimes. Currently (April 2011) the road which connects the airport to town is under maintenance and traffic at peak hours is nothing less than crazy so program yourself to go there early. In the passengers lounge there is absolutely nothing to do but a couple of convenience stores to buy soda and crackers. Toilets are decent but with no towels nor soap to wash the hands.,3,0
abuja-airport,C Stafford,,Upon arrival from Amsterdam on KLM I went to use the bathroom and there was no garbage can and no toilet paper. The airport was cleaner than I expected. I think it's better than Lagos actually. Our luggage failed to arrive with us and we were told to come back in 3 days time to pick it up! We weren't going to be anywhere near Abuja in 3 days! We were told later by the airline (after we got back to the US) that they should have delivered it to us. (It was a 6 hour drive one way by the way.) Leaving was a nightmare. They had no record of our changed flight days and had no way of checking with our credit card (we were told that's all we would need to verify our changed dates-a credit card.) We were told to step aside while they helped other passengers. Then we were sent to one person who told us to go to another person etc etc. It took two hours to straighten out the mess and that was only because my husband had to beg the woman to let him use her computer so he could check his email which he was sure would have a confirmation of the change. I will say this particular woman was very professional and willing to do whatever it took to help us. Boarding passes were hand-written. Upon checking our baggage the woman typed in LIM instead of ILM which meant our bags were heading for Lima Peru not Wilmington North Carolina! This screw-up was revealed to us upon arriving in Atlanta. Overall not a good experience with the airport or maybe it was just KLM/Delta. Who knows. I was not impressed.,2,0
abuja-airport,Mark Bickerton,,The international terminal is nice and quite well organised but there is nothing much to do there. The domestic terminal is madness especially between 4pm and 7pm when many flights depart for Lagos. Its more like an old bus station than an airport and I am not sure the security is that strong (last time I was there the boarding passes were handwritten on small pieces of photocopied paper),2,0
abuja-airport,S Adewale,,In Nigerian standards relatively clean and organized. However I was bored out of my mind when waiting for my flight because the shopping and entertainment possibilities is nil. Overall and compared to Lagos domestic terminal this airport is paradise on earth.,,0
accra-kotoka-airport,Hans Gross,Switzerland,This time it took 2 hours instead of the usual half hour for landing and immigration. The huge delay was caused first by a 'parking problem' for the aircraft second by the malfunction of 2 of the 3 luggage conveyor belts. For the return embarkation Emirates with its 300-seater had set the check-in period to from 12.30 am (instead of the usual 3.30 pm) until 5.30 pm which did not prevent a delay again of 1 hour for the take-off at 8 pm. The main annoyances of this airport have persisted over the last 10 years: Passengers may enter soaked with sweat and cannot have a shower (I go to the Landing restaurant and try to wipe myself in the toilet room). The sweating continues in the departure hall which is only half air-conditioned. Announcements can barely be understood as there is a cacophony stemming from the sound of TV's and the voices of passengers. It also remains amusing to count the number of passenger controls and checks: there are 4 by the airline and about 6 by other airport staff.,3,0
accra-kotoka-airport,D Tan,Malaysia,"Lack of air-conditioning facilities. Officers going through your bag after check in to ""ensure"" nothing illegal definitely made my luggage messy after hours of arranging and packing at my hotel. Asking passengers of certain zone to board first which all have to board the first bus and other subsequent zone will board the 2nd bus. In the end both buses arrived at the plane at the same time making it crowded. If that is the case what is the point of asking passengers of certain zone to board first? Totally disappointed with the staff/officers in the airport.",3,0
accra-kotoka-airport,P Mayo,United Kingdom,I think arrangements have changed since some of the earlier reviews. Go straight to your check-in desk on arrival or you could try the check-in machines if you have hand luggage only. From check-in go upstairs to immigration; you need to complete a disembarkation card which is just before the immigration queue. After queuing there you queue again to go through security. This can take some time. Once through if travelling business etc. there are two executive lounges the first one seems to get really crowded last time I went people were standing in there. If your airline or lounge card allows you to I would carry on toward gate 1 and use the lounge there which seems more roomy comfortable and generally more tranquil.,5,0
accra-kotoka-airport,A Fleming,Ghana,I have been through Kotoka International Airport more times than I care to remember and the attached domestic terminal a couple of times. Against most other African airports I have passed through (around 30) it is at the top end and there is an evident desire to improve. The airport is relatively small has only two gates for international departures and there are an ever increasing list of carriers adding Accra to their routes. Departure is not usually too bad security keeps the majority who may bother travellers at bay. Many first time passengers do not realise the need to go to the extreme right end of the airport for a customs check before going to their check in queue. This can result in additional queuing for the uninitiated as there is no signage. There are well in excess of 20 counters so whilst it can be crowded in the evening as others mention it is not unmanageable. Passengers must go upstairs for immigration and here is the best eating place in the airport - the only problem is that is security are doing their job they may not allow your friends to come and eat with you. In this case there are a few outside eating options within a short walk of the departure area of which Airport Landing is probably the best for a full meal. Once through immigration the shopping options are limited and overpriced but there are places for drinks snacks or even small time gambling. Business passengers will according to their carrier be assigned to one of two lounges - whilst neither is spectacular the lounge used in the main by Skyteam partners is my preference. It has a view of the runway and usually some kind of food as well the usual drinks. This lounge is close to the departure gates for intercontinental flights but there are times when African flights including Kenyan are from the gate located at the other end of the airport. The other lounge is used by BA Emirates and also Star Alliance partners (South African Lufthansa and United and apparently soon to be Turkish). This has minimal food no natural light but is nicely decorated and probably has the better drinks selection. The main x-ray security is before you go to your gate and you then sit in an often poorly air conditioned room awaiting boarding - it is rare for boarding to start when they first announce that it is. These areas often have passengers from multiple flights at one time and there is some small risk of boarding the wrong plane in the chaos that can ensure. It is not the best end to the departure experience but with the limited space and an expanding range of carriers it is hard to overcome this and as others state staff are for the most part friendly and polite. On arrival immigration is normally not more than 10 or 15 minutes bags can be quick or slow like most places (though I find very slow for late night flights) and you must then go downstairs where you are likely to have your baggage tag checked to confirm you have picked up the correct item(s) of luggage. Beyond this point it can be a little chaotic - people will almost certainly offer you a taxi and try to carry your bag then put pressure on you for a tip. If you do not want any of these services it is best to smile and say so - personally I would always favour trying to arrange a reliable pick up at any unfamiliar airport and in Accra most hotels can arrange for this. The domestic terminal is fairly spartan but perfectly adequate.,3,0
accra-kotoka-airport,E Tompkins,United Kingdom,No one tried to grab my bag or to bundle past me no one even offered to carry my bag for money. Not sure if this issue of being hassled is still an issue anymore? People were friendly (as I found throughout Ghana). There are lots and lots and lots of checks - I think 8 in total including immigration - just accept it and allow time. Air conditioned throughout. The restaurants are on the Ghana side of immigration - it does all the Ghanaian dishes food was OK a bit expensive but fine. Also there is a place that does burgers fries sandwiches etc. Food on the other side is limited so if you are hungry and want more than a sandwich eat the Ghana side of immigration. All European planes leave about 9pm hence there are a lot of people going through about 7pm. KLM say they close their check-in desk 2 hours before flight leaves - don't know if this is true as I didn't test it! I took the advice of the airline and checked in before 7pm and then waited in the middle waiting area - after immigration but before final set of security checks - which has small restaurant duty free shops (with very expensive local goods and booze etc) before proceeding to the boarding area which is cramped and smelly. Note when you have gone through immigration but before you get to your boarding gate if you are flying to Europe you have to go through another security scannerso ensure any water you buy after immigration is sealed in a bag. You also have to go through another 3 passport checks so be prepared!,3,0
accra-kotoka-airport,G Davis,,Arrivals into Kotoka are not bad. You clear immigration pretty quickly and they have a traditional baggage carousel where the bags come out. Lots of people hassle you for money once you get outside the airport but that is to be expected. Departures are another story. They say to arrive 2 to 3 hours ahead of your flight and that is no joke. It takes forever to go through all of the boarding pass and passport checks. There are too many to count. In addition there is only one x-ray security scanner at each of the two gates and so if you have two large planes leaving from the same gate as was the case for me you have some 600 people filing through the one security scanner area. It was complete mayhem as people who are late for their flights or who don't feel like standing in line just push right to the front of the line and no-one stops them. Once you are at the gate area there are no shops and only one very dirty restroom for 600 people. All passengers for all flights are crammed into the same gate area. I advise that you stay in the middle area of the airport where the shops are as long as possible before proceeding to the gate areas at eather end of the terminal. If you are offered a pass to the lounges Adinkra is in that middle area near the duty free shop and Akwaaba is at gate 1 just before the scanner. You will have to go around the long line waiting at the security scanner at gate 1 and you will see the lounge hidden in the back wall.,2,0
accra-kotoka-airport,Hans Gross,,This airport improves slowly but steadily yet seems never being able to cross the 3 star barrier even for the class of airports in a developing countries. Until one gets to the airplane one has to pass a record number of checks and controls: At the entrance to the departure hall there is a control point where people are refused who don't have a ticket. If you are White you will not be checked here. Before you can join the queue to the check-in you must show a passport and a paper which could be your ticket. Before you really enter the queue to the check-in they check your passport and ticket. Then you can proceed to the check- in. In my case I had to wait half an hour before the counter because the system was not working. In due course the staff filled out the forms by hand. Then you go upstairs to the passport control. Before you enter this room there is another check point where you show passport and boarding card. Security check. Real passport and visa control and stamping. General check point before going to the boarding gate hall operated by airport officials. Specific check point just at the entrance of the boarding gate hall operated by airline officials. 1Check-point before leaving the gate hall. Check-point before entering the transfer bus. Maybe there are more checks which I have forgotten. Astonishingly there is no control when entering the airplane. The halls especially the boarding gate still do not have a pleasant air-conditioning. In spite of the ventilators it is too warm and humid. Also too loud.,3,0
accra-kotoka-airport,A Annor,,Kotoka International Airport has improved over the years but a lot more work has to be done I must say. They need to get the RIGHT people to work for them and not have money scavaging people who will try and get into your pockets for all you have by trying to help you. You will think they are being nice but at the end they want you to cough up. Some of the staff there are quite rude and I can't understand why they won't allow people who aren't travelling [those accompanying travellers] to come into the airport. Most staff have no manners and take no notice of you they push you from one corner to the next and do not sympathise which really hacks me off. I should be proud of my country but I am not happy at all they really need to fix up in everything they do. I do not like the way customs open up your bag and search manually by taking things out and expect you to put it back in which is ridiculous its time they got with technology.,2,0
accra-kotoka-airport,Hans Gross,,This time my departure was not as usual in the late night when most flights to Europe go but in the late afternoon. This avoided being among the masses of passengers for different flights in the gate hall. What confused me this time were the passport controls which where labeled with IMMIGRATION apparently due to reorganisation. Control points: 1. Before check-in. 2. Check-in 3. Before passport control 4. Passport control. 5. Before entering gate. 6. Before entering airplane.,3,0
accra-kotoka-airport,R Kwabena,,The airport has improved overtime but there is still a lot more work to be done. Baggage claim is such a hassle. Airport is still riddled with wrong people who want money for themselves. We can do much better than this.,3,0
accra-kotoka-airport,C Hawk,,"The airport continues to improve. By no means are the services where they could (should) be but they are better than before. As more and more business travel moves through Accra the law of supply and demand should help improve the quality and efficiency of the airport. The baggage claim is woefully lacking. Food is marginally adequate. Need to get rid of people outside of airport trying to ""help"" you.",2,0
accra-kotoka-airport,Hans Gross,,The number of controls has decreased from former 8 to 6. After the entry I should have shown my ticket although flying ticketless. I explained them that now most flights are ticketless hence the control unnecessary. At check-in I got a boarding card indicating that I should go to the gate (an uncomfortable place) at 21h30 although the flight was to be at 23h30. At 22h30 I was able to hear an announcement telling to go to the gate 2 (the visual information system did not work). There was a long queu already waiting so I went back to the hall. The next message heard was that another flight announced for gate 2 was redirected to gate 1. So a flock of people walked away and I went to the gate once more without having to wait for the entry control. I was asked for the ticket and the same dialogue began as before. They said I could not fly unless I would show a ticket. In order to show what they meant they order another passenger to show 'a ticket'. It was a flight confirmation on a shabby piece of fax paper. I had left the confirmation in the checked-in baggage but due to a lucky incident I found a preliminary confirmation in my handbag which was accepted. At departure time passengers were still coming in with up to 3 handbags and gigantic suit cases and the flight took with 1 hour of delay. Apparently they had been accepted although too late. Pack every valuable into your handbag if you don't have a hard suit case.,2,0
accra-kotoka-airport,Melissa Hartmann,,I was in transit through Accra twice recently flying between Johannesburg and London Gatwick on Ghana International. The airport is quite basic but functional and the staff are all very friendly if not particularly efficient. On the outbound flight we didn't even enter the terminal building due to a very tight connection but 3 hours on the return was more than enough to explore the very limited options. Any transit longer than 4-5 hours would be unbearable if only because of the horribly accented announcements every 10 minutes trying to sell you a raffle ticket.,,0
accra-kotoka-airport,Kwabena Yeboah,,The airport overall has improved from my last visit in 2001 and continues to go thru major renovations to bring it up to modern standards. The departure process has improved and the departure lounge could use updating. The air-conditioning system has significantly improved and is cooler and more consistent. The arrival process has also improved and this time around I was not too harassed by the bribers; I didn't see much of that on arrival however Ghanaians living abroad are still subjected to minor harassments and covert bribery attempts on both arrival and departures by staffers checking baggage and performing unnecessary baggage checks in attempts to part with travelers belongings. This needs to stop! I hope the renovations are completed by the 2008 African Cup to accommodate the many travelers who will pass through the airport.,,0
accra-kotoka-airport,Eric Simpson,,I wasn’t sure what to expect on reaching Accra despite having read previous comments. It turned out to be a slightly surreal experience There are no airbridges. Passengers were bussed the short distance from the aircraft to the arrivals wing. A long poorly lit corridor led to the somewhat shabby immigration hall. Not perhaps the best first impression for arriving passengers. Clearing immigration and customs was a slow process however the officials seemed to go out of their way to give first time visitors a beaming “Welcome to Ghana”. Baggage reclaim proved to be a bit of a scrum. The public area of the arrivals level was much brighter and more modern in its décor but it felt somewhat empty and unfinished. The most intimidating aspect was being approached and asked for a tip to provide security by someone clearly eyeing up my luggage. Fortunately the driver meeting me arrived at that moment and whisked me off safely. Departing Accra provided a somewhat different experience. The outside of the Departures level was positively packed the reason quickly became apparent as only passengers were allowed inside the building. The appearance of the check in area was quite modern although it was not particularly well signposted and had a somewhat stark feel to it. Having joined a very long line at the KLM check in desks I was quickly directed to leave the queue to clear customs a requirement which departing passengers should undertake before checking in and which was not clearly indicated. Check-in was speedy thanks to a KLM official directing frequent flier card holders to the Business Class desks but passport control and security checks were slow. The large departure lounge has recently been refurbished it contains an attractive duty free shopping area and refreshment and seating areas. On a less positive note the seats were metal and lacking any form of cushioning were uncomfortable. Public address announcements were almost inaudible. Like the refurbished part of the arrivals level there were vast areas of unoccupied space perhaps awaiting future retail outlets or other passenger facilities. There are two departure gates one at either end of the lounge. With two flights boarding simultaneously through Gate 2 this is where things broke down. The corridor from the lounge to the departure gate was shabby and the toilets were in a disgusting condition. With 500 or so passengers crowded into the boarding lounge and no apparent PA system airline staff were pushing up and down shouting at the top of their voices trying to separate passengers into groups for boarding. Two busses were in use transferring passengers from the gate to the two aircraft. Although the process only took about an hour it was a chaotic hot and very uncomfortable experience. Sadly these last few yards took away the otherwise favourable impression of the Departures level of Kotoka International Airport. I hope that the refurbishment which is underway continues and quickly addresses the shortcomings particularly in the arrivals area.,,0
accra-kotoka-airport,Graham Martins,,Accra airport has improved a lot from the old days but still has a long way before it catches up with even its colleagues in Lagos nearby. No jetways poor airconditioning and dysfunctional signage are only three of the problems it faces. The only saving grace is the friendliness of the hardworking staff. My flights on both Ghana International and Aerocontractors left in the middle of peak hours but the airline staff did a wonderful job shepherding us through snaking immigration and security lines. There is construction going on everywhere so it can only bode well for a more improved terminal in due course.,,0
accra-kotoka-airport,Eric Mensah,,Accra airport has improved tremendously since the start of new national carrier Ghana International Airlines. There is a special chec kin area for the new airline and everything moves quickly and with efficient staff (mix of local Ghanaians and Americans). Immigration checks are still very long and the airconditioning does not work so it is very unpleasant. Duty Free shopping is good and prices are same as London mostly. Boarding area is still under construction so passengers are taken in buses to the planes. Arrivals however is very quick and efficient. My baggage from GIA flight had arrived before I reached the terminal building which is faster than I have seen in any other airport. Overall great potential for the airport if this can be maintained.,,0
accra-kotoka-airport,John Federspiel,,"Having been there three times during the past 18 months many things have changed for the better. Back in 2004 I was impressed by how quick my baggage turned up and the warm welcome by the immigration officers on my first visit to Ghana. Not so impressed by dirty toilets though taxi drivers and baggage carriers offering their service ""proactively"" after arrival immigration officers worrying me seriously on my first departure from ACC. Summer 2005 clean toilets working air condition at the departure gates friendly staff. Duty-free shopping facilities were ridiculously overpriced for some items though. Autumn 2005 quick baggage delivery after arrival nobody asking for ""food money"" in the airport short cues and loads of immigration officers available on departure - you could actually understand the announcements done through the PA system.",,0
accra-kotoka-airport,Fadi El-Eter,,"Kotoka must be one of the funniest airports I've ever visited. As soon as I arrived I had the feeling that I arrived to a developing country. First I had to walk from the airplane to the airport under light rain. Waiting for the luggage was another joke as it took a hell of a long time and there was also this guy with a chalk marking all the luggage that were moving on the carpet (no idea why). Eventually I went to customs (I had nothing to declare) yet my luggage was searched 3 times. It was actually the first time that my luggage got searched in front of me let alone 3 times by 3 different people. I discovered later that the customs people were doing this in order to get money. Oh and all through the way there were staff asking for money. I specially remember that guy who asked me ""What did you get for your nice friends in Africa?"". Now when departing I was amazed to see that the gate looked exactly like my class when I was 11 or 12 I guess: crowded all people facing the same direction and no A/C. Bottom line be prepared for a sub-standard airport and to give some ""gifts"" to your ""friends"" whenever you're arriving or leaving this country.",,0
accra-kotoka-airport,Li Mu Bai,,I have been using Kotoka International Airport for the past three years and very time I travel I fear the worst. The airport has only two departure lounges where passengers seat like they are in school bus all facing in front. On Fridays and Saturdays when there are several flights departing almost at the same time the departure lounges are full to capacity. The situation is worse when flights are delayed and it is normal to find more 500+ passengers in a lounge meant for not more than 200 people. Air-conditioning in the lounges does not work well and the TVs make so much noise that it is impossible to hear the announcements. The Duty Free shops are extortion points selling items for prices that are way above the normal price. Indeed there are renovations going on at the airport but the benefits are yet to be seen. A couple of years back customs officers used to connive with “helpers” (trolley pushers) and armed robbers and several passengers arriving in Accra had their items stolen. The Government moved in and cleared the airport of “helpers”. These people are back again. In addition there are just too many people asking for payments for the services that they have not rendered.,,0
accra-kotoka-airport,Sindre Riddervold,,I have been at Accra Kotoka International several times during the last couple of years. You definitely get the feeling of being in a third world country from the moment you arrive. But the facilities at the airport has improved the last years. It is smart to be met by someone at the aiport especially if you travel alone and it's your first time in Ghana. Be sure to check in at least 3 hours before your flight departs.,,0
accra-kotoka-airport,Alfred Blankson,,My seventeen year old daughter was returning to us alone to London. Despite having stamped UK visa and both Ghanaian and British passports and being a minor an immigration officer bullied and harassed her on a late night flight (she was last in queue) while she was also feeling feverish. He extorted £100 off her claiming she was the sister of the person in the passport and pocketed the money.,,0
accra-kotoka-airport,Rohit Lakhani,,I've had the pleasure and unique opportunity of checking-in at Accra's Kotoka International Airport on several occasions. The general service and style of the airport that of a third world country airport. Regular delays of flights inattentive staff and long slow-moving queues. However this all adds to the personality of the airport. It has character. Before your flight you can grind on some tasty kebabs at the thatched-roof kiosk near the parking lot. I do feel you can enjoy this airport if you go with an open mind and adventurous spirit.,,0
accra-kotoka-airport,Sasha Tufuor,,"Kotoka airport has certainly been ""cleaned up"" in terms of its appearance. Unfortunately I cannot say the same about its personnel staff. My most recent encounter with Kotoka airport was on 31 March 2004. It's certainly left me disappointed enough to want to write this email. Having arrived over 2hrs early in order to check in for my flight I then had to endure the following frustrating events. Having checked in I made my way to what appears to be a ""Security Point"". I was asked to complete an immigration card. As I didn't have a pen I asked a member of staff to lend me his. I was totally ignored. Another traveller (a Ghanian man) who was obviously as embarrassed as I by this apparent curtness informed me that I would be seen to soon. Meanwhile an official with his family were waved through before my request was attended to. This particular member of staff made no attempt by way of an apology for ignoring me for a over five minutes. I completed the card and handed it over. He took it examined it along with my travel documents and then waved me on like a naughty school child (I felt sufficiently humiliated to feel like a 10 yr old and not an adult of 37yrs). I then foolishly made the mistake of wanting to purchase a drink in the bar next to the Duty Free Shop. I requested a glass of wine from a female bar staff. She advised me that I could only purchase a bottle of wine and then walked away before I could even enquire about an alternative drink. I was sufficiently aghast enough to just stand rooted for a minute or so. Another bar staff noted this approached me and asked if I required a service. I informed her that I did but I didn't think I would receive it (I then went and sat down). Having eventually made it to the departure lounge I found myself along with other passengers waiting for over an hour to board tour plan. There were no announcements to explain this delay. In actually fact the apology came from the captain (KLM). I can only say that I feel sufficiently frustrated and humiliated enough to seriously consider not returning back to Ghana in the immediate future.",,0
adana-airport,William Foran,,Adana is in the southern part of Turkey and so the grounds of the airport are full of palm trees and other desert flora. It is chaotic as the previous reviewer has commented. What was amazing to see was aircraft taxiing in on the same part of the tarmac as passengers walking in from their recently landed flights. I recommend the restaurant on the second level. The food was terrific ( it is frequently so in Turkey) and the view (Including the aforementioned strange combination of people and aircraft) was very entertaining. Most of the flights are domestic/commuter flights and therefore the airport is otherwise very quiet apart from the morning and evening rush hours. Yes one could get a whiff of tobacco smoke or strange odors in the terminal but this is the middle east. One should take these differences between our world and theirs in stride.,3,0
adana-airport,Robert Clark,,"Adana Airport is a chaotic airport at best yet not as bad as airports in other countries that surround it. There are two terminals to the Adana Airport Domestic and International. In most cases the International side is only for the pilgrimage flights to Makkah Saudi Arabia and some limited flights into Northern Cyprus. The Domestic side starts with citizens wanting to take your bags up to the security screening (right at the entrance to the terminal). They will expect a tip for this very small action. Tell them ""hayir saa olun"" and you'll be left alone. You'll put your bags onto the belt and your passport will be checked. Even if you are flying domestically have your passport on you at all times. They will check the validity of your visa and if you have over-extended your welcome. Once you are through (P.S. Security does not speak English so bring some phrases with you) you will have to go to the airline of your choice. Even if you have no luggage and paper tickets you will still have to check in. Organized chaos is the best way I can put it. Regardless if you are flying Turkish Pegasus or Onur Air you will still have people cutting in line using Hefty bags as luggage and uncomfortable closeness. When you finally get to the front the people at the ticket counter normally speak english. MAKE SURE you ask if your bags get taken all the way. Some times they do - sometimes they don't. You may have to pick them back up in Istanbul so its important they make it clear. Once you are done you are left in a terminal that reeks of a foul Turkish soguk gone bad sick passengers that don't cover their mouths when they cough passengers that make that disgusting ""spit like a man"" sound and the ever famous stare. There is a smoking section but it is not seperate from any other room so non-smokers will be subjected to 2nd hand smoke. There is a small store that sells refreshments but does not open until 6am while some flights are much earlier. You'll be hard pressed for a seat so get to the airport early or get used to standing. Keep an eye on your things at all times. Lots of people look suspicious. The loudspeaker is hard to understand in this dimly lighted building and its usually only in Turkish. Just line up whenever everyone else does and try to sneak a peak at their ticket to see if it is your flight. You will go through a second security and enter the gate area. Once again - organized chaos. There is no ""area calling"" and to ""rows 1-10."" Its a massive cattle heard. Just try to get in the front. Once your identity and ticket are checked you will walk out onto the tarmac where you will see a bunch of suitcases (and Hefty bags) This is where is can get confusing. Before you can board the place you must claim your suitcase yet again and give it to the baggage handlers. I guess this is good since you do ensure it gets on the plane but if its a large flight it can be difficult in the dark to find your items. DEPARTURE INTERNATIONAL: Should you get lucky enough and go through immigration in Adana it is much easier than Istanbul. The Duty Free section is very tiny and only has alcohol and cigarettes but the customs queues are tiny in comparison to Istanbul. This may happen to you even if you are going through Istanbul to an international flight so it is always best to check over at International first to see if you leave from there or domestic. For your sake I hope you leave Internationally. ARRIVAL: Landings are pretty simple. If you go through customs (there will only be like 10 of you) you will go through a small customs kiosk your passport will be scrutinized and you'll get to have a rare ""Adana"" stamp in your passport unlike most who travel to Turkey with the ""Istanbul"" stamp. Your bags will come on a low riding baggage claim separate from the domestic fliers and quick out the door. If you are flying in domestically (or after checking into customs in Istanbul) you will have to wait quite a long time before the bags finally arrive onto the low riding baggage claim. In here is where you can rent a car as well about 4 companies are available on site and for those going to the NATO base there is a Hertz located in the Burger King. Back to the airpoort when you get outside you can be picked up by your people (they will not be allowed into the airport) or you can hire a taxi. A gentleman usually brings the taxi to you and loads your bags he will expect a tip. 2 YTL is good enough. P.S. - A good taxi (spelled taksi in Turkish) to go with would be Gate Taxi at +90(322)316TAXI - they speak English. It will cost more but the drivers have better English than the airport taxis) In the airport just dial 322316TAXI. One more thing before I forget - turn around whern you enter the terminal - you'll see the lost luggage department. If you fly here to Adana more than once - expect to go in here a few times. The airport itself is a dirty mess...it smells the facilities are usually dirty it reeks of smoke and it gets pretty loud.",,0
addis-ababa-airport,Attila Szaz,Hungary,"I choose Ethiopean Airlines from VIE via ADD to SEZ and back because of the reasonable ticket price. I checked the comments about ADD and they looked ok. It was the worst airport I have seen. Dirty seats, water leaking from the roof of the terminal building, awful smell everywhere. 3 people can fit in the smoking room and 30 smoke in front of it, no wifi, no connection for the credit card terminals, unorganised line ups at the rude security checks. No elevators for baby strollers, 30 mins waiting at the toilets, incorrect information on the screens, etc.. Ethiopean airlines was ok, the crew and the food were fantastic, but because of ADD airport, I will never fly with them again.",1,0
addis-ababa-airport,Michelle Costa,United Arab Emirates,"I stopped here on route from DXB to EBB (July 2015), and again on the way back to DXB. What an awful place.

I shall never use this airport again, either as a destination or for transiting.",1,0
addis-ababa-airport,Andy Deacon,United Kingdom,My first ever sight of Africa (en route to Lilongwe and then car to Zambia) love the chaotic feel and different cultures passing through and I like to chat with different races. One day I would like to spend time in Addis instead of being just in transit there. Ok its not perfect but hey life would be boring without a bit of hassle. My only gripe is the toilets not enough for the amount of people passing through. I will be there again in July en route to my wife in Zambia.,8,1
addis-ababa-airport,G D Bucknall,United Kingdom,I flew from Juba to LHR via Addis Christmas 2014. Reasonable airport facilities food and drink expensive souvenirs more of a rip off than usual toilets cleanish in the international terminal. Crazy part I was not allowed to take my duty free bottle of spirits bought in the airport through security. I had to either put it in my backpack and check it in to hold baggage or abandon my booze at the gate. No warning of this crazy rule at either duty free shops or at the security gate. Only airport more chaotic in the region is Juba. Not my choice of route and I only use it because it is my employers decision. Ethiopian airport staff very friendly and really do try to assist. Best part of the Addis / Heathrow flight is the fairly new Boeing Dreamliners used on that route.,,0
addis-ababa-airport,A Finnigan,United Kingdom,A very disappointing end to a great holiday in Ethiopia. The airport is reasonably comfortable but poor facilities after check-in and everything is unbelievably expensive by any standards not just Ethiopian. Only thing reasonably priced to spend leftover money on is a coke or water for $1 otherwise forget it even a tiny fridge magnet goes for $12! Airport staff either unbelievably stupid or just plain annoying. Told me I couldn't go through security with a small bottle of water that I just bought in the duty free shop. So basically they are saying there are lots of duty free goods to buy but when you go through to board your flight they will be taken off you because they are bot permitted through security absolutely brilliant! I was forced to drink the water before going through then when boarding my flight back to London saw that the guy boarding in front of me had a half full bottle of coke in his backpack pocket. So what on earth was that all about? An airport that cannot possibly be recommended.,2,0
addis-ababa-airport,M Noormohamed,United States,This is a very chaotic and crowded airport. There are plenty of monitors to show destination gates and departures. Staff are very friendly but get overwhelmed because of a lack of information. They do their best. Our flight to EBB was cancelled and instead we were all put on a flight to NBO with a stop in EBB. No announcement was made re flight cancellation. Having status (Star Alliance Gold or Silver) will help gain access to the lounges and eliminate long lines at security. The public toilets are filthy with some passengers washing their feet in the sinks. Even the toilets in the lounges leave much to be desired with water all over the floor. There is Ebola screening for all arriving passengers. Baggage handling was excellent. We checked bags against the advice of friends. Our baggage arrived at our destinations with no problems at all.,5,0
addis-ababa-airport,C Meier,Germany,A bad airport layout. Much to many flights/people for the size of the airport. check in slow but ok. Very long queues at security check. Bad facilities not enough toilets (just 1 toilet for 8 boarding gates)!,2,0
addis-ababa-airport,J Pfaeler,Germany,Unfortunately a very chaotic and less organized airport. No scanners no displays at the gates less staff who can help toilets dirty. Also luggage got lost. Only manual unloading sorting and loading. So my luggage arrived at Dubai instead of Frankfurt! Safety is minimum. Staff very friendly. They do their best! Less announcements lots of mistakes at the flight lists (flights missing etc.).,2,0
addis-ababa-airport,R Sundberg,Sweden,Not a nice airport. Confusing old dirty. And the tax-free shops don't accept all credit cards or currencies. Only dollars when I asked around. Not even local currency? Since you are not supposed to take Birr outside the country it would have been great to be able to use it at the airport. Toilets seems to be non-existent in the transfer hall. Had to go back into main hall for a visit. Queuing for the check-in was chaos. People were continuously jumping the line and there was nobody in charge.,2,0
addis-ababa-airport,Jennifer Tseng,United States,Awful and confusing airport but better than others in East Africa. There are two terminals and the airport authority frequently changes which departures leave from which terminal. It is not easy to get from one terminal to another - an infrequent shuttle bus is provided for this purpose. Entering Terminal 1 from Terminal 2 requires dragging your carry-on bags up a flight of stairs (no elevator provided) and the departure lounges and business class lounge in this terminal are uncomfortable even if you can find a seat. Terminal 2 is only slightly better - but the bottleneck through security is ridiculously inefficient - full of pushing and shoving and cutting in line. The departure gates in Terminal 2 are slightly better than in Terminal 1 as is the business class lounge. That being said the food at both lounges is terrible and the seating uncomfortable. Bathrooms in both business class lounges feature doors that do not close cleaning buckets left inside and unsanitary conditions.,2,0
addis-ababa-airport,C Wajsberg,Israel,Still the same dirty and poorly organized airport as I remember it was some years ago during my first visit. Duty free stores as much as you want but do not wake up some of the ladies working there when you fly in early in the morning and payment by credit card is a no go as 7% surcharge added to your bill. Nearly no food outlets and the few available do not look very inspiring . Long cues for security check but that I can still accept no food or drink even not water to be bought after passing security. Still using the colored sticker system that sometimes does not even seems to be of any use. If it was not for Ethiopian airlines giving your great value and service for the price they charge I would not use this airport or at least avoid it.,3,0
addis-ababa-airport,Mario Eybers,South Africa,By far the worst airport I have encountered. There is one working toilet in-transit. The shops look like they have been there since 1930. Even during the day the airport is dark and dusty. The staff are very helpful and friendly. The food and beverages in the shops looks unappetising. With so many people going through this airport one would expect more. Heavy security but that one can tolerate considering it is for everyone's benefit.,,0
addis-ababa-airport,T Woyesa,United States,Overflowing crowded and completely disorganized. While the tight security is a necessity the floor layout and the utter confusion inside the terminal makes this place absolutely nightmarish. This airport is way over capacity. The matter is made worse by the incompetent approach Ethiopian airlines has towards customer service. My family had confirmed ticket with seat assignment to IAD but were denied boarding due to apparent equipment change to a smaller airplane (777-300 to a 777-200). Can not wait for the day when KQ starts to fly to the US.,,0
addis-ababa-airport,Alain Kupferman,Thailand,Addis Ababa belongs to those airports which should be avoided whenever possible: chaotic queuing unclear announcements (if any) miserable business lounge.,3,0
addis-ababa-airport,Hendri Vorster,New Zealand,The ATM didn't work and the credit card machines did not connect. People everywhere complaining about delayed flights. Communication of the ground staff was very poor if at all. Our boarding were moved 3 times from boarding gate no 1 to no 5. Nobody that worked there had an idea what was going on. About 100 people was trying to sort flights with one attendant with no information. Very poor for an airline.,3,0
addis-ababa-airport,C Wajsberg,,I was only there flying in from Johannesburg and on to my next flight to Hong Kong I found this airport to be a small provincial airport. Terminal is dirty duty free dark and badly organized cloud nine lounge small and old fashioned. No separate security control for business class passengers and if there was one business class seemed to be really large on my flight that evening. After queuing a second time after security check to receive some kind of coloured bar on your boarding pass that tells when you can board the plane just wait until the duty officer calls for boarding be careful not to be pushed aside by the mass of people running towards the stairs. Conclusions - this airport needs an urgent upgrade and be totally reorganized as this place is a real shame compared to most other intl airports I visit.,,0
addis-ababa-airport,A Menon,Zambia,Have visited Addis Ababa Bole International Airport several times in the past few years on transit. Been very pleased with the airport as it is really pleasant and clean for a short lay-over. Plenty of duty free stores and few restaurants with reasonable pricing. Also Business class lounge has quite good variety of food and clean toilets. There is free wi-fi available throughout the airport. Definitely one of the best African hubs compared to others such as Nairobi. Would recommend this airport as a hub for anyone travelling to and from Africa.,8,1
addis-ababa-airport,Chris Foster,United Kingdom,"We had a 6 hour stopover from 9pm to 3am. There is a cafe airside with a great selection of food beer soft drinks etc. I can't remember the name but it is next to the ""executive lounges"" (actually 2 small rooms with chairs around). There is a TV and lots of tables available with some very comfy chairs at no extra cost. There is free wi fi available the prices are reasonable and the staff could not be nicer. They allowed us to stay after the cafe closed at 12pm and even offered my 10 year old daughter a mattress to sleep on. The rest of the airport is pretty so-so toilets are ok (they work and are not overflowing). Without the cafe it would have been pretty unpleasant but it made it a very bearable stop over. We went through security both inbound and outbound with no problems and it took less time than the queue length suggested. When you go through to the gate there are no shops available so better leave this until the last minute if you can. Ethiopian airlines had everyone queue for a boarding order sticker but then used a bus to get to the plane so that was a waste of time.",7,1
addis-ababa-airport,L Norton,Zimbabwe,I don't care much for this airport. No wifi. No washrooms in the boarding area. There are designated smoking areas but people seem to smoke everywhere. Generally the airport looks dinghy maybe this is due to the renovations. The duty free shops did not accept international cards at the time I wanted to buy and the pickings were slim in the stores. If I could avoid this airport I would.,4,0
addis-ababa-airport,G McGillivray,Australia,Long and slow security checks to get into the airport however once through this process it was smooth. A reasonable selection of cafes/restaurants and some good souvenir shops. The toilets were ok and generally clean. There is free wifi (which worked on my initial visit but not on the return). A lot of flights left around 12-1am which meant the boarding/screening process was crowded and slow but staff managed this quite well.,4,0
addis-ababa-airport,K Sandvær,Norway,I have traveled trough Bole Airport 6 times. Getting a visa on arrival can take 20-40 mins. Then there is the passport control (immigration) and usually its a nice queue there that takes another 20-40 mins. The security staff will match you bag receipt with your bag before you are allowed to proceed to customs. At customs they will screen all your bags but it normally doesn't take more than 5-10 mins. When departing from the international terminal the security queue usually go all the way out through the door and out. After that you get access to the duty free area with high prices and before you get access to the gates you must pass through another security check. After the final check there is no washrooms. The airport is usually clean with fair washrooms. Not always soap and paper and that is bad. Staff at the airport is friendly. All in all its ok airport.,3,0
addis-ababa-airport,P Heintze,Zimbabwe,I have travelled through Addis 3 times now. 100s of passengers had to wait on the runway for 10 mins until the bus arrived. In the terminal there were no screens or signs directing people to their respective connecting flights. Airport staff shouted out names of African cities and asked as many passengers as they could. Thumbs up for commitment and being helpful to lost or confused travellers. I was surprised to see my luggage arrive at my final destination but the transfer worked fine. When getting out of the airport be prepared to spend another 30 mins waiting in line to have your luggage checked and screened again. What I really dislike is the security check procedure with screening at the entrance and screening at the gate again.,3,0
addis-ababa-airport,N Hopkins,United States,At Bole International as at other Ethiopian airports one must go through security twice -- removing shoes jackets watches and other items -- and going through the X-ray machines two times as well. Bole is a modern facility; but during my five hour layover neither the escalators nor the elevators were working. Not that meant I missed much. The dining and shopping facilities were all but non-existent until I passed through security the second time and got to the departures area. There were then mostly cheap souvenir shops. Curiously smoking is banned everywhere in the airport except at food and/or drinks bars.,3,0
addis-ababa-airport,Keith Rogers,Canada,Had 1am departure so arrived at 10pm. Typical crush on airport entry with scanner at front door but no big deal overall. Check in smooth as we were business class and customs process smooth with priority line. Upstairs area has a lot of shops and restaurants. Entry to boarding area processed volume well.,3,0
addis-ababa-airport,Adam Simmons,Spain,I was also the victim of an Ethiopian Airways 757 jet fire so spent rather longer in this airport than expected. For a major transit airport it is astonishing that there is no newspaper or magazine outlet. Some of the duty free shops are rip-off joints charging a seven percent surcharge on credit cards. They are also selective in what goods can be paid for in local currency (crisps) and which cannot (chocolate - go figure). My high point was a very tasty tilapia and french fries for only US$ and the airport was kept clean by a veritable army of support staff.,3,0
addis-ababa-airport,Alistair Nicoll,,Overall the airport is usually OK and it does not take long to get a visa on arrival. Duty free on the way out is expensive (local cigarettes nearly twice the price duty free than tax paid in town) and the bank will often claim to have no Western currency when you want to change Birr back. No consistent policy about what you can take on the plane sometimes you can take bottled water other times you can not. last time the confiscated my lighter (cheap throw away).,4,0
addis-ababa-airport,Harold Bush,,Bole is modern and looks good. But it feels and works like an Eastern European or Cuban airport in the old days of the Cold War. Shops are 300% more expensive. Do not buy Ethiopian crosses and other metallic souvenirs as they will be confiscated or put in the hold. Do not take more that 250 birr out of the country if you plan to return. A friend of mine was leaving with 350 birrs but 100 was confiscated. He was told that on his return customs would return the cash. This is a lie. As our flight was cancelled due to a major technical matter (Ethiopian 757 engine caught fire on take off) we were allowed to go back into the country yet when he tried to get the 100 birrs back he was told it was not possible because it now belonged to Ethiopia. This is corruption en masse pure and simple robbery. 100 birr is just under 10 US$ but imagine if it was much more.,2,0
addis-ababa-airport,I Abodunrin,,I've only used the Addis Ababa Airport twice but both times have been great. The airport is one of the finest I've seen in Africa and it's also relatively speedy. The staff are very polite and professional and very helpful.,4,0
addis-ababa-airport,J Abebe,,Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa is clean compact and effective. Arrivals was quick. (I recommend getting your visa prior to arriving in ADD as the visa application process does take a while) Clearing immigration and getting your passport stamp took no longer than 3 minutes. Bags took about 20 minutes to arrive and came out sporadically but all came safely and thats all that matters. Ethiopian customs x-rays all luggage prior to exiting so that took some time as well but you are dealt with in a professional and polite manner. As for departures your tickets and passports are checked prior to entering the terminal building and there is an x-ray and metal detector immediately upon entering. Check-in was efficient USA departures have their own area where you are asked the typical security questions. Your passports/visas are heavily scrutinized (presumably because of the large amount of fraudulent documents that make their way through ADD and airlines getting charged large fines for transporting these people.) Passing through immigration is a simple exit stamp and you proceed upstairs where there is a fair amount of duty free shops and eateries. There is another security check to enter the specific gate area (and might I add the metal detector in the gate is extremely sensitive). Overall ADD is a clean and efficient airport with no major problems or difficulties encountered. 4 stars only because they could use a better selection of eateries.,4,0
addis-ababa-airport,S Rose,,Arrived Addis at 6am - luckily most passengers were in transit so entering was easy but time consuming. First you need to get your visa stamped in your passport then you can proceed to passport control - very lengthy passprt check. To exit baggage area you must xray your bags no line control which is a pity. Terminal clean and modern but toilets smell horrible. Late night departure was easy as very few departures still every step takes forever. Duty free decent but wont take local currency which is annoying. More security at the gate and then its a trap if the flight is delayed. Any trip to the bathroom requires a new security check.,4,0
addis-ababa-airport,C Williams,,Addis Ababa's Bole Intl Airport is a new 5 gate terminal. On arrival immigration does take some time but you are dealt with in a courteous and professional manner. Although there are signs on the queue's - (Ethiopians Visitors Diplomats etc) you can use any queue. The visitor queue was quite long so we walked up to the diplomat queue and we were stamped in with no questions asked. Luggage collection & customs are swift although all bags are x-rayed by customs. The terminal is beautiful with Ethiopian marble all over the ground and a lot of cultural artefacts throughout the airport. Departures/check-in is fairly swift immigration is a quick stamp out. Note that you are security screened immediately upon entering the airport and before entering your gate. The duty free areas have a nice selection of Ethiopian artefacts. I have to agree with comments below about the bathrooms - they leave a lot to be desired.,4,0
addis-ababa-airport,H Jackson,,Seems a clean and spacious airport. Quite a few restaurants in the departure area. Security is adequate. Not bad at all.,3,0
addis-ababa-airport,Chris Aardt,,"I flew from South Africa to the Middle East via Addis. Upon my arrival on Saturday evening just after 9 most of my fellow airplane passengers ran to the ""next"" destination - the hotel voucher transit booth. When I got there I understood why the other ran! One big ""Q"" with only two staff issuing vouchers. I finally got my voucher and proceeded to the immigration booth - only one for all transit visitors although all the other booths' Qs was rather empty... Finally got through and waited for the bus - it was now already past midnight!!! And we had to get the bus the next morning at 06:30! Not much sleep left. The airport itself was clean.",2,0
addis-ababa-airport,P Bedson,,A nearly new airport with not much traffic but high stress. Check in always takes forever - regardless of airline or class. You then have to pass through a series of subsequent security checks before reaching airside. Passport control is quite quick outbound but less than fast inbound (depending on how many flights land at the time) Airside is clean and spacious with reasonable coffee bars and a few duty free shops selling all the usual stuff you don't need or want. I'm not sure how well the airport will look in 5 years time - it seems to be aging rather quickly.,3,0
addis-ababa-airport,Sameer Sethi,,Clean spacious and modern. Staff is very friendly. Duty free shops are reasonable and has a good assortment of goods. Immigration is fast and courteous. All in all a very good experience.,4,0
addis-ababa-airport,Steve Atkinson,,Having read the previous comments wasn't sure about spending four hours at this airport. In fact it was fine - very clean a couple of restaurants/bars and a good selection of duty free shops. It can get a bit crowded when there are more than three flights due to depart but generally there are plenty of seats available especially in the area away from the shopping area. Immigration were friendly and fairly quick and the security process is what we have come to expect these days but certainly no worse than anywhere else. I have used this airport four times in the past six weeks and have no complaints - it is clean comfortable and hassle free.,4,0
addis-ababa-airport,Peter Whiting,,Ethiopian Airlines suggested by travel agent as a value for money airline between South Africa and Thailand. And indeed the stop-over periods at Addis Ababa seemed very good. But the airport itself negates the whole experience. While the whole airport is reasonably clean the toilets and basins left a lot to be desired. Seats missing taps not working leaking basis and toilets etc. The Duty Free Shop is the only saving grace; a surprising array of goods on sale at even more surprising prices. The staff are friendly helpful and courteous. There are not enough facilities for eating and drinking for the number of passengers in transit at any one time. You have to grab a seat quickly at Addis as there aren't nearly enough chairs in the general area. Then your flight gets called about an hour and a half before you are due to leave; this is due to the most excruciating security check (transit passenger) where you virtually have to strip completely to satisfy the sensitivity of the metal detector. Naturally this takes a long time. On presenting your Boarding Pass you then have to hand over your Passport which is subject to a full immigration check - in transit? After all this rigmarole you are then summoned to the plane at once so be careful - you could get trampled on by the ensuing rugby scrum. This comes to a screeching halt halfway to the plane itself - yet another bureaucratic official is present; he reduces your Boarding Pass ticket to the size of a pinhead. And then you find someone sitting in your seat. Ethiopian Airlines were nice once airborne but that bureaucratic airport spoils the experience.,,0
addis-ababa-airport,Brett Borach,,This is a brand new state of the art terminal as you land in Addis Ababa you see a beautiful building made up of a combination of large glass panels and a shiny silver structure. The airport is very much open plan and very spacious The staff at the airport are very friendly and helpful and is very convienant if you are in transit as all the flights leave from the same terminal. It does take sometime to pass through immigration but when your turn arrives you are dealt with in a very polite and curtious manner. When I visited there was a limited selection of duty free items for sale but there were some new shops preparing to open soon. The baggage delivery was rather quick and efficient. When you reach the arrivals section there is a tourist support service which can give you information about hotels and taxis to the centre of town. Another nice thing about this airport is that it is so close to the centre of town that it is only a 10 minute drive. The only thing I can say that I did not like about this airport is that I passed through it three times and never was the bank open in the departures section open to change all your unused local currency so my advice is change your money before leaving Addis funny that the bank in the arrivals section by immigration always seems to be open to buy local currency. On the whole a very impressive airport and a pleasure to use.,,0
addis-ababa-airport,Matt Sudders,,Addis Ababa has a shiny new beautiful terminal building. Unfortunately it has also adopted the flexible space concept similar to London Stansted which means that and area has thin cardboard dividing walls. Thus the Business lounge is a box in the middle of all the noise. In addition the facilities had not (mid may) fully opened meaning that there were no money exchange desks open prior to the evening departure of the international flights. The one thing they really need to sort out is the visa office. You have to pay a fee upon arrival which can only be paid in Ethiopian currency (which they only tell you when you finally reach the window). They then keep your passport - send you to another snail queue for the bank before returning and rejoining afresh the visa snail pace queue. All in all over 2 hrs at midnight. The bizarre thing is that dollars are accepted for the departure tax but not from the incoming visitors.,,0
adelaide-airport,Siti Raudzah Malik,Malaysia,A very fine airport above average. The only downside was just the WiFi. The toilet was a bit dirty but nothing too disturbing as there were only toilet papers scattered on the floor. Other than that everything else was fine. The ground staffs were very nice and helpful. The security was also very tight but at the same time they were very polite and not rude. A good airport overall.,8,1
adelaide-airport,L Bree,Australia,Airside it looks very 60's but entering it was light and bright and modern. The signage to collect baggage was very poor and we just followed everyone else hoping they too were collecting bags. Apart from this it is an easy small airport to travel from/to and I really liked it. Sure there are not a lot of food places or shops but there are enough for the size of it. Outside there is an open space concreted not sure what that is for? You traverse it to go to catch a taxi it is easily marked however. There are huge windows while waiting for your flight that you can see the runway clearly which was really nice. I definitely think this is one of Australia's better/easier airports.,10,1
adelaide-airport,Alastair Finch,United Kingdom,Flew in here in October and very impressed with rapidity of baggage collection and cleanliness of terminal.,10,1
adelaide-airport,H Davis,Australia,Adelaide has a small airport without many shops. Certainly no massage or gym. Security is very relaxed - no guns and is a very pleasant place to sit and wait. The food expensive but not-so-great - but this is the case for most airports. However the primary function of such a building is to arrive and depart. Although a car ramp was built several years ago allowing passengers to be deposited 3 metres from the terminal this has been permanently disabled. Now taxis and domestic vehicles can only pass from over 30 metres away. Hilariously its been mentioned that this is to prevent terrorism but in my experience Adelaidians are not this paranoid self-aggrandising or stupid. If it were true I'm sure they would beef up their security in more sensible ways. More likely a structural issue that is taking too long to fix. Unfortunately due to the long an unavoidable walk to and from the terminal from any mode of transport - the airport fails in its basic function of arriving and departing with ease.,2,0
adelaide-airport,D Butler,Australia,I wonder why the Adelaide airport design layout features an access ramp up to the departures level that is not used. It was in use when the new airport was first opened and worked brilliantly as I am sure it was designed to. So why the decision to abandon it? The current system of every single person and vehicle congregating in about 50 meters of kerbside is bordering on stupid. I was told it may be for security reasons. That is also hard to understand and is also bordering on stupidity.,5,1
adelaide-airport,J Jhons,Australia,Adelaide Airport is one of the greatest I have been to. Its only a few years old with many airline that you know and love operating flights weekly here. The terminal looks out on to the main runway with many shops. During peek hours there is often quite a large line up to get through security but apart from that it's all good!,9,1
adelaide-airport,Hijaz Kamal Hasnan,Malaysia,My favourite Australian airport. Brand new white and pretty spacious for a small airport. Well connected by the local bus service and very near to Adelaide city centre. One design flaw when people walk to the terminal from the pick up and drop off area you are exposed to the elements save for some un-practical tilted canopies that offer no shelter. The airport should have made a completely covered walkway which will be useful during the wet winter and the blazing summer. The departure counters were not many hence queues were long the ground staff like any Australian airport disinterested not helpful and tend to find faults with baggage. Security was fussy for a small airport. The departure terminal is spacious but does not have many shops. Eateries include a hungry Jack and some cafes. Tried a noodle bar the fried noodle was unpalatable and very expensive by Asian standards. Other shops were not interesting. Immigration was OK and swift. Waiting areas feels spacious well lit and with a good view of the runway and part of the Adelaide skyline. Overall a very god airport by Australian standards.,8,1
adelaide-airport,Mark Werner,Australia,For a relatively new airport in a supposedly first-world Australia the airport design is an absolute disgrace no doubt designed by the public works department by people who have presumably never travelled overseas and experienced the world's best airports. Although never well designed at least the former separate departures ramp and arrivals area worked far better than the 'new improved' combined drop off and pick up area now situated across a bland concrete plaza from the terminal so passengers can experience the bitter cold wind and driving rains of winter or the scorching sun and blast furnace winds of summer - really sensible! Further evidence that the designers never even bothered looking overseas are the abysmal toilets - two large heavy doors to push and pull through with luggage and grubby taps you have to touch at the basins - so inferior to the no doors and automatic sensor taps one finds in so many airports nowadays. Hopefully you never have to arrive ADL on a large international flight as they couldn't even design the international baggage collection and customs area to function properly. After collecting baggage there is not enough space to queue for customs so mayhem ensues with people not even being able to determine where to queue for customs. All a shambles avoid if possible.,1,0
adelaide-airport,E Stier,Germany,Very clean and nice airport. But: Check in is without any seat and often crowded. For all international flights you must use ONE line for another screening and the pass controls. it takes a long time - even you traveling in First. That's not acceptable.,4,0
adelaide-airport,Henry Tib,Australia,"Drop off requires a walk across the new open air empty Plaza which is between the drop off and the terminal and can be a problem in avoiding inclement weather at the drop off and also in reaching the departure taxi rank. The terminal was obviously designed and built by an ""Engineer"" as the terminal is close to the ramp requires walking down a winding slope to board the aircraft. Catering amenities are very limited though the terminal is clean with plenty of seating. Being a new terminal it could have been better designed.",7,1
adelaide-airport,R Gonzaga,Malaysia,Great little airport well laid out and easy to navigate. It is bright and spacious and there is free wi-fi which is painfully slow. Arrivals is a bit of a let down with you being forced to go through an arrival duty free shop. There is only one baggage carousel for international flights which makes it a problem if a large aircraft lands let alone multiple long haul flights. Customs is slow with numerous people asking you the very same questions. Perhaps they should consider having more people man the immigration booths and less customs staff. They obviously have little to do in such a small airport so are overzealous. On return check-in facilities were good friendly staff. There were many shops in the departure area which is a communal area for both international and domestic departures. The actual immigration and customs for international flights is a small area which is hard to miss! One other drawback is the pick-up and drop-off area what a mess! Overall I would give this airport the thumbs up but they need to make improvements to some of their services.,7,1
adelaide-airport,Eve Spence,Australia,I was travelling economy to Brisbane with my 85 year old mother and found it a pleasurable experience due in no small way to the helpful staff who greeted us in the check-in area providing us immediately with a wheel chair then later giving us priority boarding. The terminal itself was very clean and modern with good facilities and lovely views over the tarmac and Adelaide city in the distance. The taxi driver who took us to the airport an easy drive from the city centre was also very helpful and considerate. All in all a beautiful city with airport to match.,10,1
adelaide-airport,B Knight,Australia,I live in Adelaide and travel a lot. This airport is a huge improvement on the one it replaced. However I have used the new airport at least a dozen times a year since it opened and in my view it is greatly overrated an opportunity missed reflecting the small-mindedness of the state of South Australia itself. The long straight layout may help plane movements on the tarmac but is a nuisance for passengers inside. The walk to a toilet can be quite long and the way some of the boarding gates are sealed off for international flights is cumbersome and must surely make future expansion of this business difficult. Signposting on the access roads outside is unclear and about the only plus is that the new parking station has made traffic movement better. The taxi rank can be very slow-moving when it is busy and the attendants are more of a help than a hindrance a waste of money in my view as they add no value at all.,5,0
adelaide-airport,Mark Kemper,United States,I have used this airport for arrival and departure only once but found the experience to be quite alright. The building itself is aesthetically pleasing. It has that spacious feeling that has now become en vogue for airports. I arrived from Launceston in the early morning. The flight was on-time and the wait for my baggage was very reasonable. It was a facile airport to navigate and I was easily able to locate the person picking me up in the arrivals area. Upon departure that evening I flew to Sydney. We were late arriving as business kept us late. Hence I was in a rush. However I was dropped off and was able to check in very quickly. The security screening was relatively efficient and I made it to my flight in time. It seems like this airport is just large enough to provide the proper service but small enough to be far from overwhelming.,8,1
adelaide-airport,N Bromwich,United Kingdom,Just like the city itself Adelaide Airport has enough to make you feel welcome without being overly spectacular. I have used this airport many times before the building itself is stunning and relatively state-of- the-art though there is still clearly room for expansion. You can easily navigate the building with few queues and friendly staff on hand to help out. The facilities provided are minimal with enough to keep you entertained for a while but not adequate for those who may be needing to wait in the airport for a long while. I hope they choose to develop the airport further in the future.,8,1
adelaide-airport,Gabriel Komarnicki,Philippines,It's not the biggest nor the busiest airport in Australia but it has to be one of the most beautiful and easy- to-get-around airports. The different browns and yellows representing the Australian landscape make for a relaxing experience for any first-time visitor to Adelaide. The best thing about Adelaide Airport is the way the early morning sun streams through the windows at the departures area. All in all it's a superb airport.,9,1
adelaide-airport,Shane Dinnison,Australia,Arrived from Denpasar at 8am 30 minutes early and there were two other flights arriving at the same time QF from Singapore and MH from KL. Customs and arrivals hall a shambles. One baggage carrousel for three flights and a customs queue that snaked through the hall much to everyone's frustration.,5,1
adelaide-airport,J A Crowhurst,Australia,The 'improvements' at ADL airport recently could not be worse. There is now only a single designated area for both pick-up and let-down which is in the new car park and is a shambles. No other airport I know of has this absurd arrangement. The upper level (departures) area was ideal and un-congested but now it is closed off completely. What a waste of infrastructure that functioned so well. The new overhead walk-way from the car park has eased the congestion caused by the old 'Zebra' crossing but one support for this walk-way is in the road underneath! That road is only 2 lanes wide but now is reduced to one just where taxis congregate. When one disembarks from a plane the air-bridge does not go to the correct floor level. Instead one must walk up two quite steep ramps. Levels should have been built to synchronise correctly. Again a unique and absurd feature of this 'new' airport!,4,1
adelaide-airport,J Drury,New Zealand,My experience as an international arrival passenger was first class - walk from gate to customs was acceptable and baggage arrived quickly. I had some food which I declared and the inspection was carried out politely and quickly. Once I left the processing area I was looking for the shuttle service I had booked however I was unable to find it so took a regular taxi instead. My recommendation would be to make shuttle buses more visible as at most airports you can see the range of transport options when you exit the terminal taxis buses and shuttles. It became a bad experience for me when it should have been easy.,5,1
adelaide-airport,D Silverstone,United States,I think it's very telling that the only negative reviews have been regarding the long-term parking not being as friendly and helpful as the rest of the airport is! ADL was the best airport experience I had while visiting Australia and although not perfect it is a very commendable mid-sized airport. The terminal building is new clean and bright with a very fast door-to-gate process. The gate area does stretch on for a bit so you can wind up with quite a bit of hike not only in transferring but also in getting to the food or shop you need! All the staff I encountered were helpful and friendly and the airport is very close and accessible to the city. Highly recommend!,4,0
adelaide-airport,M O'Connor,,When the new Adelaide airport was first opened they had a great system of long term car parking where a friendly guy in a van would pick you up after you parked and take you the terminal and vice versa with very little waiting time often from the car and back. In recent years they have introduced a bus that goes every 20 minutes. Most of the time we walk to and from the terminal because inevitably the bus is not in sync with the arrivals of planes particularly at night and the bus just sits at the car park and waits until the 20minutes is up and comes over the terminal so you are at your car before he has even left. They also used to have an area that was undercover for you to sit and wait at the car park so if it was raining you didnt get wet. Well last night at 7.30 we arrived back in Adelaide. it was pouring and we waited 25 minutes for the bus (he must have fallen asleep) and then he dropped us off at a point with no shelter and all the passengers and bags got very wet. No one was happy with the service and when you pay $50 to park your car I think it is reasonable to expect something better. First of all it there is no point in having such a large bus it is mostly empty and most people dont have 20 minutes to spare to catch the bus when the arrive at the airport and don't particularly want to wait 20 minutes when they arrive back from their trip. They want to get home asap. Why did the airport change a system that was exceptionally good to something very poor? It is such a shame as everything else about the airport is great.,1,0
adelaide-airport,Peter Bates,,My most recent experience of the Adelaide terminal was flying as an international passenger. After previous poor experiences I was prepared for the worst but was very pleasantly surprised by the general lack of congestion in the processing areas both departing and arriving. There are now self service machines for passport verification for incoming passengers with the latest electronic passports and that has seemed to ease the waiting problems previously encountered. In the customs and baggage collection area too processing was ultra fast but then it was only one plane load. Nevertheless the best experience I have ever had here as an arriving international passenger in terms of the efficiency with which I was processed. If this is the new normal standard I can only say a heartfelt congratulations to the airport management for at last lifting its game to meet the level of organisational efficiency expected for the fees charged. As mentioned in a 2008 post the domestic side of the airport is excellent and proximity to the CBD is unrivalled by any other Australian capital city.,5,0
adelaide-airport,Michael Young,,Long Term car park situation is still an issue. No signs to indicate if free space. Parking pay station machines constantly out of order. No staff on site for assistance. Shuttle bus to terminal does not leave on time drivers tend to wait for those people dawdling or running therefore adding extra minutes to those who have planned ahead.,2,0
adelaide-airport,J Thomson,,Nice clean airport. Quite small but has all you need. Very expensive but all airports are. Friendly staff and huge glass windows show out on to the runways so you can see everything thats going on out there. Very nice.,4,0
adelaide-airport,C Steven,,The new Adelaide T1 is so much better than any other. Its been designed as a multi use terminal meaning that the international area can be opened up for domestic pax when not needed for overseas flights. The airside wall is all glass is you get great views of what is happening on the ground planes landing etc which is great for kids to see. Free internet for those of us attached to laptops or iPhones all the time. Some people complain about the distance from checkin to dep gate if its one of the end gates. But its still shorter than from the Rex gate at MEL to checkin there. Adl is bright and clean makes MEL and SYD look dull and old in comparison. For anyone who ever had to endue the old terminal the new one is bliss.,5,0
adelaide-airport,S Srinivasan,,Found ADL to be a small but good airport. Maybe I got lucky but when I arrived at the international terminal there were no queues at immigration the officer was very friendly and welcoming bags were waiting for us by the time we made it to the carousel and customs/quarantine took no time at all. We were at the rental car counter within 30 minutes of landing. Departing through the domestic terminal early morning there were no queues at check-in or security plenty of seating was available and free WiFi was available. There was a fair variety of restaurants and shops which didn't fleece you too bad with their prices. It was a long walk however from security to our departure gate which was at the far end of the terminal.,4,0
adelaide-airport,C Fenton,,After the nightmare of Sydney Adelaide Airport is a pleasant surprise. Fast processing baggage was there before me on the carousel and a very clean bright airport and easy to navigate. Then parking was right outside the front door too something I have never experienced. We had a short drive to the city centre this is a very well located and designed airport. On our outbound trip we were processed fast by very friendly staff mostly and good cheap food outlets and lots of good shops to browse. Great open viewing areas of the runway too.,5,0
adelaide-airport,D Dale,,Arrived to Adelaide Airport from Brisbane on Qantas flight. The terminal is new and the interior is welcoming. The airport is roomy and spacious. Our bags were on the carousel within minutes. We travelled into Adelaide on the SkyLink shuttle bus which only cost $5.00. I would have to rate Adelaide as probably the best airport in Australia as it is just a breeze to navigate. We also used the Qantas Club which I have to say was the cleanest and quietest of all those I have utilised of all airports in Australia. Gets five stars for being so modern and organised.,5,0
adelaide-airport,Peter Bates,,Adelaide's new airport terminal is something of a mixed bag. Mostly the domestic side of the operation is much improved over what was and is a pleasure to use. Parking arrangements are very poor at present. The international part of the operation is sub-standard as far as ease of passenger processing is concerned No apparent effort has been made to provide either sufficient space or staff numbers to ensure rapid processing of passengers particularly incoming through customs and immigration. Once past immigration the cramped baggage collection area soon becomes crowded and the next movement towards the X-Ray machines is complete anarchy with no staff controlling the passenger flow in this area. This is very poor and no improvement over the arrangement s of 10 years ago. I don't recommend Adelaide as a preferred point of either entry or exit from Australia although for domestic flights to other major Australian cities I rate it as good. Proximity to the CBD is outstanding.,3,0
adelaide-airport,Andrew Scott,,For a small city airport Adelaide's new Terminal 1 is great. I have been to many airports in the US big and small and they are all the same. Adelaide stood out to me it is new light and fresh. A small selection of cafes newsagents and shops makes killing time possible. The airport is very easy to navigate yourself around: Check in upstairs Baggage Collection Downstairs. A small Qantas Club Lounge is available for members and is quite nice although small. Check in is easy with many staff around to help. Security lines were minimal.,4,0
adelaide-airport,Teresa Tyler,,We have only used the domestic terminal at Adelaide but found it very light spacious and clean with good facilities. A nice experience.,4,0
adelaide-airport,Mike Young,,Arrival international still just as bad as the old terminal. Forty minutes for luggage to arrive on carousel. Overzealous customs staff repeatedly asking questions to same passengers including myself and travel partner due to us waiting 40 minutes for our luggage and foregetting who they spoke to! Queues for the exiting customs x-ray too long and with trolleys became disorderly and many impatient people pushing in or not joining the queue. Complete lack of on ground staff besides customs to direct passengers.,2,0
adelaide-airport,Gerry McGuinness,,The long term carpark is an absolute aberration apology signs everywhere saying there is no more room the payment machines dont work and there are no boom gate staff. Add to that the fact that you have to go to Departures to pick up the Arrivals shuttle bus otherwise you have to negotiate traffic roundabouts landscaping etc to find your way to and from the car park in the event that you can not find the bus - millions spent on the airport and the long term carpark is something out of Fawlty Towers.,1,0
adelaide-airport,Henry Tib,,"Had my first experience travelling on a regional airline from the new Adelaide terminal. It would seem that when they designed the new terminal they forgot about the regional air passengers. The departure ""gates"" for both the regional airlines are situated at the extreme end of the terminal requiring a fair walk although you can enjoy for part of the way a 50metre travelator ( though not sure it works) . When boarding you have to be escorted by the flight crew down a number of stairs to the exit for boarding. Regional air passengers returning to Adelaide airport again have to be escorted by the co-pilot to the terminal building through a concrete passageway then go through airport security and return to the upper level departure area through a door that is well away from the designated arrival area shown on the monitors to depart the terminal. nterstate passengers have to walk down two ramps to the aircraft and it would seem for speedier boarding passengers seated at the rear of the aircraft are directed to walk across the the tarmac to the rear steps of the aircraft. A procedure no different from the old terminal. Adelaide airport had a great opportunity to build a 21st century air terminal it would seem the opportunity was taken up!",,0
adelaide-airport,Donald McKelvie,,My first visit to the new Adelaide airport and what an improvement on the old one. The only thing I found to be annoying was that there is no Qantas Club in the international Lounge and I could be wrong but I could find no monitor relating to international flights in the domestic Qantas Club. I assume that there is no QC in the International lounge because there are not a lot of international flights. Other than that very nice and spacious with plenty of views of the airport and city. A big improvement.,,0
adelaide-airport,Anil Kattula,,There have been many complaints by regional passengers about the new Adelaide terminal. Long walk up and down stairs and through long claustrophobic metal walkways which are not airconditioned and flood in wet weather. REX (regional express) is in a big fight with Adelaide airport management about this and has threatened to move back to old domestic terminal. REX have also proposed bussing arriving passengers to the old international terminal but Adelaide airport wont let them! All regional councils in South Australia are demanding Adelaide airport does something quickly to fix the situation. Until then strongly suggest that unless you are young and fit avoid flying regionally through Adelaide!,,0
adelaide-airport,P Major,,The new Adelaide Airport Terminal opened on 7th February not a moment too soon after several months of delays due to a contaminated refuelling system. The new terminal integrates regional domestic and international flights all in the same building. The new design is light and airy with floor to ceiling windows along the southern side gate lounges. These boast outstanding views to the Adelaide Hills and city undoubtedly the highlight of the building. The terminal also boasts fourteen Spanish built aerobridges the first of their kind in Australia and the first aerobridges to be used by domestic passengers in Adelaide. All in all an excellent new terminal that will provide a great new gateway to South Australia,,0
adelaide-airport,Ben Williams,,The new Adelaide terminal in finally open and a lot better than the old domestic and tragic international terminals. This new terminal is well sign posted and easy to get around. There are a few tenancies still being filled. Checking in is painless as is collection of luggage when arriving. Overall a vast improvement of the pervious terminals.,,0
adelaide-airport,Michael Smyth,,"What a missed opportunity! After all the hype leading up to it's official opening it was disappointing to use the new Adelaide terminal for the first time last week. The ""International Arrival experience"" is just as frustrating as it was in the ""old tin shed'. It took 40 minutes to clear immigration with further queues for customs checks. I realise that Adelaide is not a major international destination but surely some extra capacity could have been built in the new terminal's design.",,0
adelaide-airport,Penelope Hackett-Jones,,I love the old-fashioned feel of Adelaide's domestic terminal specially getting out of the plane and finding myself in fresh air at last. This is all going to change I'm afraid when the ubiquitous airbridges are installed making arriving in Adelaide the same as arriving anywhere else. It isn't so long ago that they had a cattle grid at the entrance to the car park! The international terminal is simply vile at present (April 2005). A huge queue at the check-in section even though all counters were operating - a total of about 10 altogether. Could they be just terribly inefficient in Adelaide? Or super-security conscious? Arrival back at the international terminal is similarly dreadful: exhausted pax who have hung around at Darwin or Sydney for a few hours in the middle of the night have to wait in another very slow queue with those hard to steer trolleys . Let's hope all this improves when the new terminal is completed at the end of 2005! Personnel there are amazingly friendly and cheerful given the difficult working conditions that they have to put up with. And the airport is really close to the city a big plus these days.,,0
adelaide-airport,Jeffrey Abbott,,Adelaide International airport is a very small airport. Upon arrival it always take me up to one hour for Customs clearance and quarantine check-up. The belt is too short in the international terminal. On departure check-in was ok. But the customs clearance took quite a long time. As what other has mentioned there is no enough seats in the terminal. Ground officers are friendly kind and helpful. Looking forward for the new terminal.,,0
adelaide-airport,James Short,,Check-in for QF flight took under 5 mins and Qantas staff were very helpful in checking baggage through to LHR. Terminal is small but functional. We passed through 9am-10.30am on a Thursday. Clean ample toilet facilities small cafe and bookshop. Good facilities for size of Airport. New Terminal building well in progress and I believe set to open 2005.,,0
adelaide-airport,T Dames,,Flew into ADL from MEL - found ADL domestic to be somewhat outdated compared to other Australian airports. No aerobridges in domestic terminal and only a handful of gate lounges - pax have to board / disembark via airstairs. Poor signage on arrival and only a small baggage claim belt. Old check-in counters and a small whiteboard at check-in area for flight information.,,0
adelaide-airport,Benjamin Lau,,Adelaide International Airport is very small (one aerobridge only; but that's going to change very soon). There's not much to do at this airport. The one advantage of this airport is that it is just 5 minutes from the CBD. So usually I go to the airport just one hour before departure. Check-in can be quite long if you arrived 2 hours before departure. The airport is clean (due to the size). Adelaide Domestic Airport is pretty average. The airport is actually quite dirty probably due to the influx of people in the airport every hour. There isn't enough seats though. Check-in is quick. The only disadvantage is that the international and domestic terminals are far apart. It takes a short ride to either terminals though. Can't wait for the new merged terminal.,,0
adelaide-airport,Neil Harvey,,Adelaide International is like a big bus station with just 5 gates and no airbridges. It's quaint and friendly and beats big brother Melbourne hands down.,,0
adelaide-airport,Janet Harcourt,,Adelaide International is a small airport with very personable Aussie-friendly staff. That includes the immigration customs quarantine and airline officials. Adelaide's small size makes life just fine for the traveller - the staff all seem to know each other and I'm sure that if anything did go wrong in this very efficient little place it would be sorted out with good humour and co-operation between the officials. The time taken from leaving my aircraft seat to being seated behind the drivers wheel of my rental car was a mere 15 minutes. It was a further 15 minute drive to my downtown hotel where the staff were equally friendly. If you are planning to visit Australia plan to arrive in Adelaide - but don't tell anyone else about this little gem! It's a pity that international flights into Adelaide are limited and only arive from SIN HKG and KUL. ADL Domestic like most Aussie airports is very efficient. There are flights every hour to SYD and MEL and plenty of non-stop flights to many other Aussie cities. Officially you need to be there 20 mins before your flight time but I checked in at the QF Club Lounge (carrying only hand luggage) just 10 mins before flight time. Unlike other Aussie airports ADL Domestic has no airbridges and really needs a complete rebuild - something the staff told me is about to happen. That said it is very clean comfortable enough and the QF Club Lounge is just fine. It has 54g wireless access points for web surfing on your laptop - a nice touch.,,0
agadir-airport,H Chown,United Kingdom,"Arrived in the middle of a hot summer's day with a temperature over 40 degrees. There is no air-conditioning in the airport but that isn't necessary due to the design of the terminal which keeps it airy and cool. The border staff looked like they had been asleep for five hours and were surprised by our arrival. Unfortunately there were lots of people outside fighting for the right to carry our bags 20 metres to the taxi. It's a bit of an annoyance but just say ""NON"" very assertively. All signs in French and Arabic announcements too.",7,0
agadir-airport,Nicola Hayter,,Service we have received has been very good for the size of the place. Incoming there is a long wait but would rather be checked in and out correctly. The gate numbers can be confusing if it is the first time you have flown out as they do change regularly.,4,0
agadir-airport,Paul Styles,,To get in from the street you must undergo luggage scan first as there's no entry hall. To get out onto the tarmac and into your plane note well that there's no queue space (the departure lounge seats are right by the exit gate doors). Our flight was announced at gate N°6 (there are only 6 gates) but after 5 minutes delay moved to gate 4 then to gate 2 for 150 people with much luggage for a flight with first come first served seats. The hostesses tried to get people to form 2 queue lines in vain so embarkation was a free for all. Shocking treatment for an international airport. Aside from that the setting is very pleasant.,1,0
agadir-airport,Kevin Maslin,,No major problems here. Lots of check-in desks open at inbound passport control so we were processed fairly quickly and directed to the transfer coach within 20 mins. Lots of 'porters' in brown uniform with trolleys offered to take our luggage when we disembarked from the coach on the return journey. We could manage ok but I think they were asking for 10 Dirham (about 70p) to take you all the way to check-in which I considered to be fairly reasonable. We were told that we could not spend our left over Dirhams in the departure lounge so we changed them at the bank (not for sterling but to euros!) in the lobby prior to joining the queue for the scanning machine. As there was only one channel in operation it took quite a while to get through and then we discovered that the shops would accept sterling euros or dirhams! Ho-hum. We had taken our own drinks through as we had been told the airport prices were shockingly expensive (even the so-called duty-free!) but we did buy 3 Snickers bars at 4.5 euros! We were not aware that our flight was overdue by half an hour as announcements were largely in French fairly inaudible and the screens were not very informative. Once the gate was open though we were ushered through to the plane quite quickly.,4,0
agadir-al-massira-airport,Alan Edwards,,As far as looks go this is good. The rest is average and below arriving luggage arrived reasonable quickly then immigration long wait then the form given on flight thoroughly checked. Departure no Morrocan currency allowed flight side payment in about anything accepted and change given in same staff efficient under the circumstances prices high. Information on flight delays non existant room just sufficient for passengers on 757 charter flight Regarding passport/immigration control on departure. If you have a rollerball pen visible be prepared for the officer wanting to swap pens! Despite these negative comments you do feel the staff are trying.,,0
ahmedabad-airport,Paranj Kalyani,United States,A relatively small international airport. Staff are friendly and sociable though the security personnel can be rude sometimes. Signs available everywhere and it is small so not difficult or tiring to navigate. Just don't get a long layover here as there is not much to do. My 3 visits have been so short that I haven't even used the restrooms! The general cleanliness is decent. Lines are short and fast moving. I've always seen all the immigration counters manned which is a big relief. Adequate seating for those 20-30 minutes before your flight. Overall not bad at all. Everything is quick and efficient.,8,1
ahmedabad-airport,S Shah,Australia,The new international airport claims to be based on Singapore Changi airport but it is far from so. The jetways do not seem to work and so passengers have to be taken by bus from the plane to the terminal. There were no wheelchairs on arrival. The staff said they were all in the departure section and people in arrival would have to wait until the wheelchairs became free. The toilets in departure don't seem to be finished - broken tiles no toilet roll hanger etc.,,0
ahmedabad-airport,Marc Guillemard,France,A small airport compared to Mumbai. Very recent and clean. For non Indian travellers be aware that without a print of your E-ticket you will not be allowed inside the airport! Once you are in everything runs smoothly queues are limited passport and luggage control is OK and you walk easily to your plane. Did not test food or drinks it's not the kind of airport where you need to be there hours in advance. All in all not a bad experience.,7,1
ahmedabad-airport,Udaybhansinh Chudasama,India,Its clean and the queues were practically non-existent when I went through (they seemed to be manning more counters than there were customers both at check-in and immigration. Yes I agree with some people that the staff have not been trained as well as at other airports and many don't seem to know anything or just want to pass you on to someone else but in general everything at this new terminal is self-explanatory. I found the signage to be clear and sufficient.,10,1
ajaccio-airport,O Beyr,,Nice little airport right next to the sea and beaches. There is not much you can expect during waiting time it is only a regional airport. Only point of criticism: access to security control. At the time I was there queues formed randomly without any guidance between around and between counters which led to some confusion and aggression as some people got away without waiting.,3,0
ajaccio-airport,Alistair Peckham,,Good efficient airport but suffers from heavy summer traffic and due to the size of the airport there can be delays just due to the amount of flights which the airport can not handle. Also not the best allocation of seats. Security staff were very pleasant and polite. Also not many cues or waits for security or boarding.,3,0
akita-airport,Diogo Leite,Portugal,"Very small airport. Domestic part is small but has everything we need, of course only one or two varieties in each aspect. International with only three flights per week is even more small, but before immigration (biggest problem there when arriving, big queues with two or three counters) it is connected inside with the domestic. Difficult to access, only taxi or bus from Akita City.",6,1
al-ain-airport,Brian Murphy,,Very small airport but a short and very cheap taxi ride from the town centre. Very convenient if one can get a connecting flight from here. A great alternative if you want to land in somewhere quiet and peaceful to the awful Abu-Dhabi airport which is dismal and full of,,0
albany-airport,Andrew Champagne,United States,I fly into and out of Albany a few times a year on business. For my money it's one of the most efficient airports in terms of security/TSA in the country. They get you in out and on your way with very little hassle the way it should be. The airport itself isn't huge and doesn't have some of the amenities of a larger hub but as a traveller I'm looking for efficiency and that's what Albany Airport provides.,9,1
albany-airport,R Lipera,United States,"This is my home airport so I fly in and out regularly. Recent renovations to the central area make it even nicer. Fully carpeted soothing music big windows everywhere. There is an observation deck open to the public on the ""non-security"" side that has good views. This is an easy airport in which to get around.",5,0
albany-airport,I Abodunrin,,It's a relatively small airport. I agree with the earlier post about it's speediness. One of my friends once arrive less than half an hour before his flight departed and was still able to fly out (though I wouldn't recommend trying this). Overall a very good airport.,5,0
albany-airport,Marc Schwartz,,"I used to live in Albany and have used this airport many times. Albany is a really nice regional airport. It is very close to the Interstate. The standard parking is extremely convenient (across an indoor footbridge; no shuttles). The airport is physically very appealing and flow through check-in to the gates is generally smooth. Same on the return (also note that rental car stuff seems to be a convenient arrangement as well). ALB is as close to ""get there at the last minute and be OK"" as any these days. B terminal is the nicest. Of course this is a regional airport without many of the amenities of a large one. The coffee shop and bar/restaurant are better than most though. I now live in LA and have a much greater hassle. Burbank airport seems similar in size to Albany but Albany is much much nicer.",,0
albuquerque-airport,Lorin McCleary,United States,ABQ is a wonderful small airport however it is an airport in decline. The basic problem is lack of competition by carriers in the Albuquerque market. Southwest has significantly cut back service to/from ABQ and eliminated non stop service to a number of cities like Seattle and Portland. I addition this lack of competition reflects in much higher fares to the same cities when compared to fares from DEN. Why the airport management at ABQ is not more aggressive in attracting carriers to the Sunport is a mystery. Without more competition in the Albuquerque market to only alternative for non-stop service at reasonable prices is to fly from DEN and do the drive to the Denver airport.,2,0
albuquerque-airport,D Graubard,United States,Great regional airport. Good food - reflecting the unique New Mexican cuisine. From drop off through ticketing and security shouldn't take more than 15 minutes. As stated before the observation area is nice and quiet - with good views of the Monzano mountains and the active runways. Decor is South-western and very classic - with a lot of the original building that existed prior to the terminal upgrade back in the 1990s. It's not O'Hare with lots of flight options but also not the delays and crowds. Just wish there were more flights as prices can be high to various hub cities.,9,1
albuquerque-airport,Chester Carter,United States,The worst airport I have visited. My flight arrived here as a connection that was delayed so we arrived close to midnight. Aside from janitors there was no one that worked for the airport readily available. As I attempted to sleep in the very poorly heated terminal until the next morning I was woken up by a security guard who told me that I cant sleep in the terminal and must go outside and then re-enter security in the morning. In the morning I was informed by the TSA agent that even though I was active duty military I cannot go through the pre-approval line unless I'm in uniform even though she knew that we are no longer supposed to travel in uniform.,2,0
albuquerque-airport,Mark Kemper,United States,I have used ABQ for departure and arrival 3 or 4 times mostly at a time when I was doing business with a local company. What I appreciated most about this airport was the easy get away and arrival. The traffic was never bad and that allowed me to get my car and get out or get to the airport and on to the check in counter with little delay or problem. The facilities are not extensive and the amenities are modest. But with 25 gates it is not overwhelming. The facilities are also aesthetically quite pleasing.,7,1
albuquerque-airport,T May,United States,A shame ABQ doesn't have many flights other than Southwest because it is definitely the best airport in the Southwest. Good security fast baggage claim and no terminal transfers since they hold everything in one building which even blends into its surroundings. Food is a little pricey as well but otherwise it is harder to find a better airport.,8,1
albuquerque-airport,Josh Cuny,United States,Albuquerque is a terrific airport. Parking is easy and affordable. Getting in and out is a breeze. The only down side is the wait at the TSA checkpoint can be long and slow so give yourself a couple hours before your flight leaves.,9,1
albuquerque-airport,E Mabley,United States,Albuquerque International Sunport is a functional medium-size US airport. There is only one terminal with 25 gates so walking distances are relatively short. The corridors are wide and ceilings are high so a bright airy feel. The airport is immaculate. The taxi and rental car shuttle rank are only about a hundred yards from the gate area exit and only steps beyond bag claim. The security queue moves relatively fast. The one negative is that food and beverage options are limited to a Quizno's a bar and grill a bakery offering mediocre sandwiches and a New Mexican restaurant offering very mediocre food.,4,0
albuquerque-airport,J Griffith,United States,"Rental cars at this airport are extremely expensive. To save a lot of money I found that renting from an in town location even with return to the airport can easily save 40% or more. The trick is to reserve before with the in-town location take a cab to the location. The cab may cost $25 to $35 but the savings can be much greater. I rented a Hertz mid-size car for 9 days with an AAA standard discount and saved $300 compared to the airport price same rental same discount card! Another point about this airport if you're traveling economy on Delta watch out! On my trip Delta had no curb check-in for baggage and the ""self-check"" inside the terminal had a line with about 200 people. Extremely annoying even if you've ""checked-in"" by Internet beforehand.",3,0
albuquerque-airport,Chris Rothenberger,,I always try to have plenty of lead time so I can go upstairs to the observation lounge - a hidden gem above the main food court. Free wireless internet leather sofas work tables and spectacular view of the mountains all make this a great place to find calm after security before the flight. Look for the two stairs flanking the large eagle-catcher statue. That's another thing: check out the permanent art collection located throughout the complex. NM is known for its native arts and what a more fitting place.,5,0
albuquerque-airport,Steve Koenig,,Mid-size fairly modern airport. Looked like free parking in front of the rental car building. Shuttles between the terminal and rental car building seemed to run quite often even at night. Decent selection of restaurants and shops for this size airport though security line area was typically chaotic.,,0
albuquerque-airport,Pedro Gil,,The southwest decor makes this airport unique. Easy rental car return with shuttle bus drivers friendly and eager to hoist your luggage on and off the bus. Certainly airport concessions everywhere can be expensive but beware the snack bar directly ahead of you after security is extremely expensive. They wanted $7.00 for a coffee and danish !,,0
albuquerque-airport,Mark Jochim,,"I've lived in Albuquerque for the past 11 years and use the Sunport frequently. Long-term parking is a breeze and I've always enjoyed the Southwestern decor of the terminal -- can't get enough of the vigas the tribal art etc. It feels more like an art gallery in areas than a drab & dreary airport!! And if you have time be sure to check out the reproduction of the first airplane to land in New Mexico and the many display cases of model aircraft (before security). There's an abundance of interesting shops and good places to eat (my favorites are Garduno's and Quizno's. It's rarely too crowded except at peak times at the concentration of gates at the far ends of the two piers. Large windows afford great views of the planes taking off and landing; I've never actually climbed the stairs to the special -- and expensive / controversial -- observation deck however. My only ""complaint"" would be that the terminal can resemble a ghost town if you arrive on a late flight (say after 10 or 11 pm or so). It would be nice if at least one place to eat would stay open for the later arrivals (the last plane from Phoenix typically arrives around 2:30 am).",,0
albuquerque-airport,D Larkin,,I'm pretty satisfied with the ABQ airport. I personally am not a fan of the Southwestern theme but I suppose it gives the airport character and fits in with the Albuquerque atmosphere. The terminal is laid out well and there's plenty of signage. Restaurant on the second floor is tasty. The best part of this airport is the FREE wireless internet! If only all airports could offer free wireless.,,0
albuquerque-airport,R Anderson,,This is a good airport and one of the few I know of that offer free wireless Internet access. I found that while up in the observation area. One piece of advice. it is IMPOSSIBLE to find a gas station anywhere near the car rental building--which is not onsite and only gotten to via a bus from the terminal. If returning a car make sure to fill up your tank before taking the exit for the airport. I found this out the hard way.,,0
albuquerque-airport,A Day,,I live in Albuquerque and it's always a relief to arrive at ABQ after a long flight. It's got to be one of the easiest airports in the world to navigate and one of the most pleasant and it's very accessible to the city. Parking is simple and the amazingly inexpensive outer lots have good reliable transportation to the terminal. Why can't all airports be this good?,,0
albuquerque-airport,George Santulli,,What a delight is the Sunport at Albuquerque! A nice smallish airport but very nicely laid out and pretty in a southwestern motif. The walk from the gate to the baggage carousel is short and pleasant due to the shops and restaurants one passes along the way.,,0
albury-airport,C Tudehope,,It's a gorgeous little country airport. The terminal only opened last October and it still has a new smell. There are no queues anywhere and in general all ground staff are friendly and laid back. There is no need to allow excess time because there will be no queues at checkin or at security-the largest planes into the airport only seat 78 people-and they aren't always full. There are lovely large windows with views over the tarmac runway and ranges in the distance (and if it's race day you can see the horses too). The cafe is good although a bit overpriced. It's interesting that whilst Virgin and Qantas passengers have to go through security Rex and Brindabella passengers don't. There are no issues to speak of in this small yet very pleasant airport.,5,0
alderney-airport,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,Flew into Alderney from Southampton. A lovely little airport. Very relaxed; friendly staff and a good shop and cafe (very good considering the airport is tiny). Taxis waiting right outside the main entrance and it only takes about 5 minutes if that to get from the aircraft to the terminal entrance. Very good all round.,9,1
alghero-fertilia-airport,Harry Albright,,A nice little airport actually in Fertilia rather than Alghero. It has been recently expanded and a new arrivals hall should be opening shortly. Arrivals are straightforward both Schengen and non-Schengen. There are two belts for luggage and then you are straight out to the arrivals hall. Car rental desks are opposite where you come out and there are a couple of cash machines as well as a bar and a few shops. At the bar you pay at the cash register then take the receipt to the bar. Apart from the car rentals there are taxis just outside arrivals although these are pricey (about 20 Euro to the centre of town). It's about 12km to Alghero. Another option is to turn right and cross the parking lot. About 100 metres away are bus stops with orange buses running to Alghero and other buses heading to Sassari and Cagliari. Buy tickets for the Alghero buses at the souvenir shop (about 70 cents) in the terminal. If this is closed ride the bus anyway. The driver will sometimes stop for you to buy tickets sometimes not. Departures is equally straightforward at the other end of the terminal from arrivals. Note though that there is absolutely nothing to do airside so don't go through too soon. Non-Schengen international flights (e.g. to the UK) all leave from gate 1 and you have to queue for passport checks before you are allowed in to the gate area. The immigration officers usually arrive about 30 minutes before the flight.,,0
algiers-airport,Qaddoumi Samar,Kuwait,Algiers airport is huge and clean but I did not enjoy the business class lounge it was extremely poor compared to other countries. I had to go outside the lounge to use the toilet they served very poor quality food. As a Muslim country I also expected to a mosque for prayers but there was no specialized area. Shopping in the airport was ok.,5,0
algiers-airport,R Oussalah,Taiwan,This is the first time in over a year I used this airport and I have to say that I am not disappointed. Its facilities are fair very clean pleasant to stroll through and spacious. The staff is pleasant and professional.,7,1
algiers-airport,Mohamed Salah,France,Good airport international terminal T1 is nice spacious clean. The only problem I see is the fact that the interdiction of smoking is not always respected.,4,0
algiers-airport,R Oussalah,Italy,"For departures Algiers new airport is fairly spacious functional and the staff is friendly. I might have been lucky but I found the police controls and security to go fairly quickly. Shops are limited but I found them sufficient also they are open very early and close late. The choice of restaurants is limited to 1 for each hall and they are of the same provider. They offer reasonable selections of light eating and drinking. On arrivals I find it inadequate to have to walk down stairs after coming off the plane. I did not see an elevator available. The wait for the luggage is too long. I was told it was due to the luggage scanner being undersized for the traffic. One important deficiency is the absence of English signs; they are all in French and Arabic only. A shame for a brand new ""International"" airport. Over all I was satisfied mainly due to efficiency at departure and the feeling of space which is lacking too often in aging European airports.",4,0
algiers-airport,Mark Wadham,,The airport building in itself is fairly attractive and spacious. However it is spoilt by 3 things - stench of smoke everywhere. Algeria is 30 years behind when it comes to smoking restrictions. Long waits and bureaucratic procedures. These are the fault of the authorities. Stood in line for 40 minutes to get through immigration. Out of stock duty-free shop. OK if you want to buy Baileys but not much else.,3,0
algiers-airport,M Fadjar,,Algiers airport has improved a lot lately especially the International section and you have to give some credit to the authority for that. It is now up to adequate standard of other International airports apart from long immigration line and numerous security checks (luckily they don't take much time per person). Handcrafts at the Duty Free are expensive but from my experience are of first quality that you do not easily find outside. Just beware that Ariival affair is always a hit and miss: if your plane arrives when there are no other queues ahead then fine but be prepared for a very chaotic and one hour long baggage collection if several flights arrive at the same time. Customs do not check suitcases but will open anything else looking suspicious (boxes cartons tool kits etc).,3,0
algiers-airport,Reyad Kesri,,Algiers new terminal is up to international standards. It offers many restaurants and facilities. Security controls are still strict but this is understandable considering what happened in this country few years ago. This new terminal is a big improvement compared to the previous one. Duty free prices are way too high though.,4,0
algiers-airport,S Farooq,,Inbound no hassles and after claiming baggage was out quickly. The airport is nice clean and much better than many I've been to. Outbound no real hassles just that there were 8 passport checks in all ! some of the people checking were standing only meters from each other not sure whats the point of so many checks but on the plus side they were courteous and quick. A few well stocked duty free shops didnt get to check the prices.,,0
alicante-airport,Jayne King,United Kingdom,"Please put a sign above the waiting bench for disabled assistance in departures, when I took a flight in June it was not signposted as a bench only for the disabled to use. We were very embarrassed when staff told us off for sitting there even though there were no signs to state it was for the disabled, so how were we to know! Please clearly signpost this as not all disabled people look disabled, and people might not realise that they need to give up the seat for them.",5,1
alicante-airport,H Weston,United Kingdom,"I have used Alicante Airport for the past fifteen years but needed assistance for the past five years since becoming Registered Blind. I have always been very grateful and impressed with the assistance until today. Having arrived at 8.36am for my 11am flight I was not taken to passport control until 10.30am! As I travel on my own I could not go to get a drink or visit the toilet in case assistance arrived. No one cared when I complained it was treated as a joke to them. It upset me very much as it is stressful enough travelling alone to visit my elderly father never have I had such terrible ""assistance"". Security at passport control were very rude not understanding as my cane was being x-rayed I couldn't walk forward as I had no idea what was in front of me!",,0
alicante-airport,J Morgan,United Kingdom,I have used Alicante Airport for 15 years or more and can say without doubt that the new terminal is a complete and unmitigated disaster. Announcements are incomprehensible Security often slow and rude the air-conditioning at best ineffective at worst a disgrace. People struggle to keep cool and there is so little seating that at busy times it is impossible for the elderly to find somewhere to sit. The food is over priced and of very poor quality. Even the VIP lounge is dreadful I can only think of Exeter Airport as worse and I have visited at least 10 different lounges in the last twelve months. I can think of nothing to redeem this airport save cleanliness.,,0
alicante-airport,J Mellor,United Kingdom,Just returned to UK last night May 10. Got to the airport early flight delayed and had a long time hanging around. As far as the usual airport experience (rarely good is it) is concerned it wasn't too bad. However the air con was inadequate and the bathroom shower when we got back home was really needed. I wonder if this would be a major problem during the very busy Summer months. Food a bit pricey but ok. I used off site car hire this time bit tedious but better than some of the big lines waiting at the on site companies.,4,1
alicante-airport,Glenn Biffen,United Kingdom,Easy to use and signage is adequate. The announcements are clear and concise. Plenty of space light and room to breathe. A good choice of shops too; this is an airport not a shopping mall! Even the security staff are human! We use this airport several times a year (property in the area). Just a shame the money situation has gone bad for the country as the old terminal could be redeveloped too.,9,1
alicante-airport,Ian Waddell,United Kingdom,My family uses Alicante airport about 6 times a year. We cannot see any obvious advantages in the new terminal over the older ones. OK the new terminal was conceived during boom times (and is far too large for current needs) but they obviously decided during construction work to cut the budgets and many of the finishes (loos being the biggest area) are cheaply done and showing wear already. The public address system is useless and they are clearly saving money by not using the air-conditioning as even in October the place was like an oven. The link from the terminal to the car parking/rental cars is a shambles and very poorly sign-posted - every new arrival who doesn't know the route is bewildered and gets lost. We never go during July and August but I shudder to think what it's like then.,4,1
alicante-airport,J Mathews,United Kingdom,I use this airport about 6 times per year it's a shame that none of the money wasted on it could have been used to extend the tram line from Alicante city directly to the airport this would make a huge difference. The new airport itself is functional but some areas were not thought out well enough. As others have said - you don't have enough seating at the gate areas. All announcements made are pointless as you cannot understand them as the acoustics are useless. Yes the food while diverse is very overpriced but then again isn't it at most airports. On the plus side if you ever have to get wheelchair assistance in Alicante airport then I would say (from experience) that the staff are excellent. They are helpful and considerate. The VIP lounge is spacious and comfortable although when they run out of food you may have to ask for more.,7,1
alicante-airport,Owen Jones-Cruickshank,United Kingdom,Quite an average airport considering how modern it is. Good check-in times quick queues at security. Not enough seating not enough shops but plenty of places to eat. Shops that were there were quite good pretty overpriced and concentrated in one place. Gate agents below par and air conditioning terrible!,7,1
alicante-airport,Anne Davies,United Kingdom,Cavernous airport with insufficient seating in many areas. On the two occasions we have flown from the airport recently the temperature has been absolutely unbearable with air conditioning totally ineffective and passengers stripping off and fanning. Outside the temperature was much lower than in the airport which heated up like a greenhouse. Announcements are incomprehensible perhaps because of the echo in the huge spaces. In the car rental areas the ramps are incredibly narrow causing difficulty in particular to those driving their cars for the first time out of the airport. Have been travelling several times a year to Alicante for 11 years. Our experience in the old airport was always excellent. Only improvement is perhaps the number of toilets but in general our experience of departures from the new airport has not been a pleasant one. We have also experienced the arrivals area - meeting friends and family coming to visit. In such a huge airport this area is minute hard for those waiting and those arriving not to fall over each other and nowhere to sit except 2 small cafes. Can we go back to the old airport which is still sitting next door?,2,0
alicante-airport,D Lightfoot,United Kingdom,Nice modern terminal. Only complaint was that the boarding gate information was wrong on the board and the signs at the gate and there was nobody from the airport or the airline to direct passengers. I found out the correct gate number and ended up making an announcement myself.,7,1
alicante-airport,Ian Waddell,United Kingdom,Whilst the new terminal has the general ambience of better-known international airports corners have been cut in the detailing probably due to the Spanish economic situation. The car rental situation is quite ridiculous. I have been through the new terminal 3 times since it opened and the route from the car rental desks to the car pick-up area is confusing without any adequate signage. There are always groups of bewildered people wandering around lost. You have either to go down by escalator from arrivals cross the road and up in a lift or up in a lift from arrivals to a bridge cross over and then down in a lift (the levels are numbered differently on each side of the bridge). The car rental booths need to be better staffed to alleviate the long queues that build up. Everything is pre-booked so they know what to expect.,5,1
alicante-airport,Emma Lewis,United Kingdom,The new airport is a lot larger so be prepared for a route march to get luggage etc on arrival. Going back we had rude and unhelpful check-in staff. Food and drink is astronomical it will cost you about 7 euros for a sandwich and a drink and 2 euros. When we got to the allocated boarding gate there were no seats which meant my daughter sitting on the floor and elderly passengers struggling to stay standing for the 40 minutes we had to wait there!,4,0
alicante-airport,B Lawrence,Spain,I was treated at the control area with great disrespect. After taking off my footwear as requested I proceeded to walk through. As I entered the boarding side this security woman approached me and snatched my scarf from around my neck without any explanation As I speak Spanish this was completely uncalled for and  in my opinion showed a vast amount of ignorance on her part. I appreciate that checks are necessary for the safeguard of passengers but she and maybe all of the staff there need a lesson in customer facing care.,2,0
alicante-airport,John Kenny,United Kingdom,Arrival from Stansted a breeze straight through immigration. On departure 10 minutes through to departures. Not keen on being forced to walk through tax free shopping area. New terminal very bright and airy although a long walk to Ryanair departure at area B. Extensive catering choice but as has been said already prices very expensive.,8,0
alicante-airport,K Mcloughlin,Spain,The irony is that since this new airport opened the frequency of some flights seems to have fallen. I refer especially to the internal flights from Alicante to Madrid particularly on Business Class. Iberia now only operate 2 flights per day compared to about 8 per day from the old airport. The parking is ok apart from the fact that only 1 level out of 5 is available for parking private cars Level 5 has been closed for months. While the catering facilities are good the prices are very high.,3,0
alicante-airport,D Leston,United Kingdom,Nice new terminal building is a vast improvement on the old ones although there's a lot more walking involved. Processing was efficient and the air-side environment is very enjoyable.,4,0
alicante-airport,Paul Van Alsten,France,Modern and convenient airport but lot of walking both upon arrival and departure. In the public area limited food facilities with overpriced offer: EUR13.40 for two sandwiches and a 50cl Fanta! Bus line C6 connects the airport to downtown Alicante every 20 mins - EUR 2.60 one-way travel time around half an hour. However bus schedules are rather approximate - each time had a delay of 10-15mins. Upon departure check-in was hassle-free - however=self-service machines are for Iberia flights only. No queue at security friendly staff with good command of English. Good air conditioning in the terminal. Limited seating areas at the boarding gates. Business lounge is spacious and fairly comfortable.,4,0
alicante-airport,Tom Maule,,Arrival processing and baggage reclaim fairly quick but a lot of walking down shallow ramps that double back several times. Nevertheless only about 25 mins from gate arrival to exiting. Departures not such a good experience Iberia handling is very slow and not enough desks open for the number of departing flights (not really the airport's fault). However security is fast and efficient with no lines to speak of. Plenty of space airside but it was a quiet winter Thursday. Adequate food outlets but very expensive for basic items. Travel value shop to be avoided where possible as all prices are well above those in shops outside. The current terminals are operating at near capacity and a new terminal is due to open this year.,3,0
alicante-airport,Brian Williamson,,Went to Alicante today to collect relatives over for a 3 week holiday. Parking good and fair price. Arrivals hall terminal one fair but several broken seats in waiting area. Food at snack bar good quality but very expensive we live in Spain and know what is a fair price this wasn´t. Toilets at terminal one arrival dirty smelly no hand drying facilities as dryer broken no soap available no paper towels. Disgusting state and NOT representative at all of Spain. Poor introduction for first time visitors. Those responsible should be ashamed.,2,0
alicante-airport,Jeffrey Leong,,Modern and clean airport. However on the airside of the airport cafes prices were expensive with poor quality sandwiches and snacks - a pack of sandwiches with uninteresting filling cost about 5 Euros which is even more than most (low cost airlines) charge. Tax Free (?) shops has reasonable selection of wines cigarettes and other products.,3,0
alicante-airport,Gilbert Peters,,This airport is not the youngest but still handles passengers very efficiently. The connexion to the town is well provided: bus C6 in front of the terminal every 40' at the incredible price of 1€. Semi-fast food restaurants are spread at different locations in the terminal. All in all a pleasant and efficient airport.,4,0
alicante-airport,Brian Hill,,Agree with previous rating busy but efficient airport. No immigration checks but quick check-in and security. Only downside is lack of luggage trolley a pain if you've booked a hire car as it can be a long walk.,4,0
alicante-airport,Elliot Hutchinson-Cox,,Used very recently. Upon arrival no problems at all no passport control on duty so straight through to the baggage carousels then well signposted exits. On return a week later another good experience queuing for check-in but lines weren't too long. Nice departure area.,4,0
alicante-airport,Andrew Orme,,Arrived Alicante 2100 hrs on Friday evening. Off plane & into baggage collection within 10 minutes. No passport control booths were empty. Looking forward to using again.,,0
alicante-airport,Natalie Moore,,When you arrive at the airport there are usually long queues depending on the time of year you go. These however do shorten very quickly but the two lanes that they have for each destination get confusing because sometimes the queues bend around. The airport is always clean and pleasant and there is enough room to move around easily while shopping and plenty of seats. The only bad points that I can think of are  everytime I travel from Alicante airport they allocate the gates that I have to travel through and then at the last minute they change which means everytime everybody runs to their correct gate. This is also very annoying when you havent got allocated seats when flying with certain budget airlines because everybody races and pushes each other. Another bad point is that when you fly from gate one you think that you can go straight onto the plane and you are the first in the queue but then you have to walk into another room wait for somebody to come and then get onto a bus to get to your plane. This is similar to the 'gate situation' in that if you haven't got allocated seats everybody is pushing each other to get to the front. This isn't fair on the families with young children who are called first so that they have priority to sit by each other by having everybody wait in a room first allows anybody to push in.,,0
alicante-airport,John Oram,,We arrived from Stansted and were very impressed. Saturday is a busy day at ALC and we parked on a remote stand but the steps and buses arrived in a flash. The immigration hall is bit bizarre as one enters at right angles to the point of exit. There was a substantial Italian style queue but it dispersed steadily even with only one immigration officer. The baggage hall was well organised. One snag with our car hire and I believe some others is that some of the big names have slightly less obviously named partners at ALC and can be difficult to spot. For the return journey the departure and check in facilities were pleasant cool and airy. Catering has improved markedly and the El Palmeral restaurant is to be recommended landside. We have been using ALC on and off for years and this is an airport which has made the improvements it needed. This is particularly the case with catering and although it could get very busy it is a welcoming airport. See also my comments on Murcia.,,0
alicante-airport,Kathy Howe,,Adrian Jay asks about Murcia San Javier. My husband and I have flown into and out of it several times as private pilots and fare paying passengers most recently in November 2005. It is adequate for an airport of its size though the departure hall was chaotic with several flights checking in at once with a shortage of seats and cafe space. The ground staff made no attempt to priority board the aircraft and it became a free for all. Parking is very limited though more is going to be provided. The airport is going to struggle as the Costas become busier with all the new properties south of Cartagena though in a few years' time there will be the new Murcia Airport inland. Of course one can avoid all this by flying in one's own aircraft though the operations staff still take an age to process the departure paperwork!,,0
alicante-airport,Adrian Jay,,I like Alicante airport. I agree that the check in can be a little slow and crowded but once through to the departure lounge there are plenty of seats good selection of shops toilets are clean etc. Arrival is OK too but you can wait ages at the car hire desks which can be frustrating. Murcia/San Javier is nearer to Torrevieja but I've no idea what it's like and there very few comments posted - anyone tried Murcia as an alternative ?,,0
alicante-airport,Lynsey McCarthy,,Queues to check in were quite long and slow and the queues through the detectors into departure lounge were long though they only had half of the desks open so that was the likely reason! Once through though the departure lounge is lovely. Clean ammenities and plenty of food and drink. Very comfy indeed!,,0
alicante-airport,Michael White,,Access to Alicante airport is good with easy parking . The check in hall is bright and spacious and there is a good range of shops. There is a fair range of eating establishments serving good quality food. Toilets are clean and plentiful. There is adequate seating in the departure lounge and gates are close and served by air bridges. This was in February so I imagine it could get a little crowded during the summer months. A good airport nevertheless.,,0
alicante-airport,John Davies,,If you are taking a late evening flight from Alicante please bring some food! Most if not all of the shops and food halls close. The duty free store (the smallest) does however remain open so you could survive on chocolate and turron! Airport is easy to navigate car rental booths can get very very busy in the summer 1hr+ queues.,,0
alicante-airport,Vesa Laakko,,Terminal is quite roomy with decent shopping and eating facilities. Plenty of places to sit alltough more and more charter flights coming so I don't know for how long.,,0
alice-springs-airport,Alastair Finch,United Kingdom,Beautiful new terminal with excellent check in security and facilities - very impressed.,10,1
alice-springs-airport,Henry Tib,Australia,A quiet domestic airport with adequate facilities though passengers are open to the elements on boarding and disembarking from aircraft.,7,1
alice-springs-airport,Paul Harvey,United Kingdom,"A typical small Australian airport which operated well. Some distance out of the city it is served by a bus and taxis (fare $30+). Check in was easy there being more than enough desks for the traffic. Security was efficient with a bookshop and cafe airside. All gates are ""walk to the plane"" which are never far away. Compared to many this is a nice airport.",5,0
almaty-airport,D Kim,Australia,Almaty airport is a tiny and dilapidated building compared to most international airports. The international terminal is cramped when you are waiting for an overseas flight and sometimes you'll be lucky to even find a place to sit. As you are coming in passport control is fairly swift and quick and collection of luggage and exiting is fast as well. As you are coming out be prepared to be greeted by a horde of gypsy taxi drivers. Most of them will overcharge you if you don't speak Russian so if you don't feel comfortable there is an official taxi booth near the exit charging 3500 Tenge. If you do decide to utilize a gypsy taxi driver come to an agreed upon price before getting in a price of 1500 - 2000 Tenge is reasonable. When buying something from one of the shops at the airport if you don't speak Russian it's important to not agree to buy anything unless there is a price tag on it. Shop keepers routinely over-charge foreigners double and even triple the amount. Overall it is not a comfortable airport to be in especially if you are waiting for an overseas flight. Limit the amount of time you have to spend there to as little as possible.,4,0
almaty-airport,H Dalem,Netherlands,An old building with old services although parts are modernized. The domestic side is on the right side with no connection to the international part. You have to exit the building to get to from domestic flights to international flights. You are not allowed to go to the airside terminal before your flight is announced for check in. This means you have to wait outside in the departure hall. WiFi is available for free but do not expect great speed. Check in is in a rather small area. Passport control is reasonably swift as is customs control and safety control. There are no shops on the domestic airside. The business lounge is almost always closed. And the local airline Air Astana does not provide this service for domestic flights. There is a small restaurant in the old and new part. There are shops in the international airside. There is a small restaurant/bar. The business lounge is available and open 24 hours. Use of this service is based on the airline. Lufthansa gets a limited menu of drinks and food. KLM seems to be more generous (no apparent restrictions). But it is an old room with plastic leather seating and not much else. There are enough ATM´s available to get cash. There are no newspapers/magazines for foreigners. Only taxis ordered or outside at the official taxi stand have decent fares. But agree on a fixed price no meters installed. Ignore offers inside the building. Almaty is no longer the capital of Kazakhstan (1997 Astana). No plans to upgrade the facilities here in the near future (April 2014).,4,0
almaty-airport,Sargeant Alan,Australia,Passed through Almaty on transit - Immigration control was prompt and without problems. Service from the Business Lounges was very poor/non existent particularly in the domestic lounge. Domestic area was very busy and overcrowded. Departure controls were OK both for security and immigration. Business check in OK but not up to standards in some other better airports like Bangkok or Istanbul. I would not choose to use the airport as a transit unless there is no other choice.,3,0
almaty-airport,Katrin Metcalf,Estonia,This is one of the worst airports I have ever been to. The transit area is almost ridiculously uncomfortable and the business lounge is not only almost ridiculous! You get about one free mineral water included in a business ticket but more than that the lounge is noisy worn and broken sofas from about 1970 no comfortable seats at all no wi-fi. Basically no nothing apart from airport staff that come in and turn up the television only they watch! A total pain and never more a lay-over here!,1,0
almaty-airport,Chris Scott-Barrett,Azerbaijan,It is a pity that Kazakhstan has such a good national airline (Air Astana) but such a poorly-organised airport at Almaty. The problem mainly seems to be with the exit border controls. Not enough booths are manned while various uniformed and non-uniformed staff mill around occasionally allowing people through without queuing leading to frustration and annoyance among remaining passengers.,3,0
almaty-airport,D Olsson,Australia,A poorly organised airport. It's not clear that international check-in is through the customs point. There were customs forms outside all in Russian. I filled one out to the best of my ability showed it to the guard and he just waved me through. My bags were checked briefly and no one looked at my form. Then I went to check-in which was quick and then to emigration. Beyond final security is a crowded room with expensive shops. PA announcements were indecipherable. I hope the new terminal is done properly because this one does nothing for Kazakhstan's and Air Astana's growing reputation.,2,0
almaty-airport,Ron Speli,,Arrived from Seoul Korea on my way to Ust-Kamenogorsk Kazakhstan. No problems with Passport Control or Customs. Lines went very fast. Baggage claim was fast - then came the fun! As you exit the baggage claim area there is a gauntlet of taxi drivers trying to solicit you. I was in need of currency and I was followed by someone who wanted to assist me with my luggage. He also offered to assist me with the money exchange! I told him no several times and he finally listened and left me alone! I did not need a taxi as I was staying at the Aksunkar hotel which is walking distance from the terminal. All in all the airport was nice and the people were friendly. It was easy to navigate through although I only speak and read English. All signs and monitors have English. The only complaints I have is when I returned to Korea from UKK. The announcements on the PA are hard to understand and no restrooms in the international departures area once you past security. They will allow you to exit past security to go but you must pass through security again. Of course that means x-rays and metal detectors and empty your pockets - again! No issues with Customs or Immigration.,3,0
almaty-airport,Alberto Pezzotti,,Almaty airport is fine. Usual CIS queue upon arrival at passport control. Barely no customs control upon arrival. The terminal is clean and you don't see any strange faces around. I also agree you should avoid people trying to take your luggage into the terminal and then charging high prices for the service. Upon departure for international flights you have to pass a customs control where they random pick somebody. I was picked-up but customs officers have been friendly and upon explanation why I was there everything was ok. Check in facilities are fine as is passport control duty free and toilets. A good improvement since my last visit in 2005 is a full body scan. I was randomly chosen for a check too (maybe it was my day for this) and in less than 3 mins I was back with the other passengers waiting for the plane.,,0
almaty-airport,David Fraisse,,"A vast improvement on the temporary arrangments that pertained after the old International terminal burned down. Customs (once a time-consuming and intimidating business) has disappeared in both Arrivals and Departures as has the on-arrival baggage scan. A clean modern and well-equipped terminal with a coffee shop for waiting until you are admitted for check-in (2 hours prior to international flights); a spacious departure lounge; good clean lavatories; a ""business"" lounge that charges for admission and where everyone smokes (though there's also a smoking booth in the departure lounge). Shopping nothing special; anything you might want (local vodka; caviar) is way cheaper in town. Watch out for scam-merchants trying to charge you for a luggage trolley.",,0
almaty-airport,Dave Stanley,,Alun Hunt's comments are fair. The business lounge does seem to be used as the smoking lounge making it unusable for us non-smokers. The shopping is a little limited but it is modern and clean.,,0
almaty-airport,Alan Hunt,,A new terminal well set out for the high volume of traffic it handles. Composite business lounge charges for the privilege of wanting a drink but comfortable. Only issue I could see was the queues to actually get to the check in areas. On three occasions early in the morning when many flights depart they had just the one point of entry to check in. Once in the queues were no worse then anywhere else. Staff generally OK but too many people around wearing military style uniforms making it difficult to work out what their airport role was.,,0
almeria-airport,Stuart Ward,United Kingdom,Interesting to see the airport since last year. Inbound passport has moved further indoors so no queuing on the road but still slow processing. There's an escalator to passports now which had a log jam at the top when we arrived so some guy had to rush out and switch it off otherwise there would be a pile of passengers at the top! Baggage arrived about 20mins after flight landed. Outbound speedy check in and security. Roof terrace still not open nothing has changed since last October.,4,0
almeria-airport,Stuart Ward,,Arrival okay queue to go through passport was a bit long. Luggage arrived on the belt as we got though. Limited baggage handlers so for a full charter flight might be longer. About 25 mins from landing to getting in the taxi. Going out the departure hall has been rebuilt much better and quicker. Security still tight big queue to get through. The departure lounge has been rebuilt and access to the rooftop terrace removed. The lounge is much better than the original. As work is going on don't know if there are plans to restore access to the roof. Small snack bar with coffee and rolls at reasonable prices but duty free for local stuff is the same price as supermarkets and imported stuff is more expensive than UK supermarket prices. Wouldn't want to arrive or depart when there are more than 2 charter/scheduled UK flights though. Then it would get overloaded very quickly.,4,0
almeria-airport,Susan Davis,,I found the airport to be more than adequate. We were there in July and it was busy but check in was OK as was security. The waiting area is small and there are not enough catering facilities but the roof top terrace was brilliant it was a pleasure to wait for the plane for once and you can have a cigarette in peace! The toilets were clean and tidy wastebins emptied frequently so all in all not a bad airport - have certainly spent time in much worse,3,0
almeria-airport,S William,,Almeria was unfortunately not built to handle the amount of traffic using it. There is only one runway which means deays in departure if there are several arrivals. The terminal facilities are sufficient in the low season but when the charters are at full peak it is woefully inadequate. The limited number of check-in desks means that when several flights are being loaded often only one or perhaps two desks are available for each. There is a real bottleneck at the one and only security entrance. Information is poor even when it is obvious that flights are late the original time is left showing on the monitors. The departure lounge is small and with only one cafe which offers a very limited selection of food and drink. There is however a large open roof seating area with lift and stair access with excellent views of the apron and runway with a cafe which opens when the airport is busy. The only bus link is crowded with non-airport passengers as already described by an earlier contributor and doesn't end at the combined bus/rail station but some 400 metres away in town. A taxi to the centre is only 8 - 10 Euros.,,0
almeria-airport,Dan Thorneycroft,,Reading some of the other reports of Almeria airport I have to say that I must have been lucky on the twenty or so times I have used the airport because I have not had any problems to complain about. The only serious problem which needs to be highlighted is the pilfering of baggage which happens. In view of the serious security problems at British airports someone in a foreign airport who can steal items from baggage could just as easily be putting something in! Almeria to Stansted appears to be the main problem and whilst the pilfering could be taking place at Stansted this is unlikely due to the limited amount of time the bags are available to the people doing the pilfering. The bags are out of sight at Almeria for up to 1.5 hours before the flight.,,0
almeria-airport,Mohd Kastor,,A small airport with limited but more than enough facilities. The immigration control area is very small with only one counter; resulted in a long queue extending to the outside of the arrival's entrance door. In the departure hall try to get anything you want (food newspaper souvenir etc.) before passing through security. Once airside there are only one small duty free shop and one very small cafe; boring poorly stocked and expensive!,,0
almeria-airport,Nick Scales,,Flew to Almeria last December on GB Airways flight.. great flight and a small efficient airport - but baggage claim and immigration woefully small for a full Airbus A320 of passengers... we had to queue outside for immigration control.. on a wet morning. Then had some confusion finding my hire car as Hertz office is a van in the car park - only manned when they have a pre booking arriving.. and also be aware of there being no filling station near the airport when you return the car!,,0
almeria-airport,Mark Evans,,Almeria is now gaining a higher profile having joined the Ryanair and easyJet networks. The single- building terminal now faces capacity limitations at peak periods and passengers are squeezed tight in the departure area when all five gates are required. The local Surbus route 20 connects LEI with the city centre some 8 km away. The fare is a very cheap EUR 0.80 and the service runs on a 40-minute headway on Mon-Sat. There is no provision for luggage and airport passengers have to mix it with the locals which can make for a crowded bus with limited seating accommodation.,,0
alor-setar-airport,Farouk Mogheth,Czech Republic,A regional airport for the northern most city in Malaysia just 45min drive from the Thai borders. A fairly sized terminal with Air Asia and Malaysian flying. Clean and very modern indeed with services and several shopping points for food. The process is fairly quick. There are only 2 gates with OK seating. The only downturn is that there is no monitor next to the gates and its not possible to see the plane on the tarmac so when we had a minor delay no one knew how much was the actual flying time and some were nervous. Otherwise very cheap flights to Kuala Lumpur- much better than a 7hrs bus ride for sure and a cheaper option to fly from BKK to southern Thailand just hop through the borders and fly to KL.,4,0
altenburg-airport,R Heelas,,As with many small airports travelling to and from Altenburg is a pleasure. The terminal is about as big as a Drive-Through burger restaurant and there is free parking within 30m of the building. This airport is an excellent option for passengers travelling to or from the southern part of the former East Germany or to the north of Bavaria (I live in Bamberg and the drive is much shorter and more pleasant than to the next nearest Ryanair airport at Frankfurt Hahn). On the downside if you arrive early the Duty Free shop is very small and the restaurant is basic but the staff are friendly.,3,0
amarillo-airport,Andrew Levy,,AMA has 2 passenger concourses but nearly all passengers must use the north concourse (serving the 30-series gates) serving American Eagle Continental Express and Southwest. The northwest concourse (serving the 20-series gates) is largely unused. As a result security screening at the north concourse is prone to long back-ups. One thought is for the airport to modify some leases and reassign tenants in order to ensure that the entire terminal is more uniformly utilized which would reduce terminal congestion.,,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,D Masanat,United States,This airport is very modern and there are numerous options for food at a reasonable price. There are enough instructions in Arabic and English to find your way. One setback is that there aren't coolers and you have to purchase bottled water from shops. Additionally you cannot bring water bottles to your flights traveling to the US (and maybe Europe). However it remains one of my favorite airports.,9,1
amman-queen-alia-airport,Faris Haddadin,United Arab Emirates,The airport is spacious relative to the annual number of passengers it serves. Its architecture is simple with fair-faced concrete columns and aluminium curtain walls. Signage is clear and informative. Facilities are in good condition and clean. Some flights have long queuing times. Crown lounge is not the best lounge I have seen however it serves the purpose with food and beverages (alcoholic as well) served comfortable couches wifi connections TV rooms children play area etc.,10,1
amman-queen-alia-airport,Ross Clark,United Kingdom,Not bad - the new terminal has plenty of room for both arrivals and departures (was part of a tour group). Would rank as one of the better airports for its size which I have used.,8,1
amman-queen-alia-airport,Khawla Amin,Qatar,Spacious well-lit airport. Fast and efficient immigration staff. Nice selection of food options (both Arabic and Western). Lots of duty free shops. I'm surprised by the negative reviews since the staff at this airport (like Jordanians in general) are very friendly.,10,1
amman-queen-alia-airport,David Pryer,United Kingdom,Not the busy hub that it was intended to be and perhaps as a result spacious open and friendly for their customers. We were in transit from Cairo to London. Even with less than a dozen people ahead of us for the security check my daughter was helpfully encouraged to take the shorter 'ladies only' line. The people on the McDonalds counter were so well trained that they seemed genuinely enthusiastic. That must be a first.,10,1
amman-queen-alia-airport,Luke Wilkinson,United Kingdom,It's a nice airport however the staff on passport/visa check are the most miserable unfriendly and downright rude people we have ever met. Upon arrival at passport control we were moved to a different queue to have our photo taken no reason was given for this and we were told to wait there while other passengers with UK passports just went straight through after paying for the visa. Our passports were eventually snatched off us and thrown back with a look of utter disgust. Never experienced such a rude introduction to a country ever! Fortunately most other Jordanians were much friendlier. Upon leaving the staff on passport control were similarly ignorant and rude.,1,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,A Nelson,United Arab Emirates,I have used QAIA on a number of occasions during the past 6 months. Lovely building decent queues immigration desks usually well staffed unlike many airports (although visa fees rather steep at JD40) all in all it is actually a pleasant airport to use and the country and the people are just lovely. I honestly cannot imagine what some reviewers are griping about this is probably the best airport in the Middle East and better than many in Europe at least in my experience!,8,1
amman-queen-alia-airport,Mark Pinfold,United Kingdom,"The worst airport I have ever experienced. Visa and immigration staff were breathtakingly rude. The staff seemed to be playing some kind of game pushing passengers between queues. We were directed to one official who simply refused to acknowledge our existence. After a long flight from Japan it was really quite disturbing. And then you have to play in the ""find the honest taxi driver' lottery. (Won one lost 5.) I will never return to Jordan.",,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,D Langstone,United Kingdom,Travelled from LHR BA0147 took 90mins to get through passport control / visa (costs 20jd per person). We had 2 bags in the hold 1 came through. After waiting another hour or so we were promised our bag would be sent to the hotel. 3 days later I went back to collect the bag. Won't moan again about all London airports.,1,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,Barrie Enslin,South Africa,Beautiful airport building can improve on restaurant options though.,8,1
amman-queen-alia-airport,P Arnold,Jordan,Baggage reclaim is still hopeless. Ours (RJ 110 Madrid to Amman) was the only flight arriving yet it still took nearly 40 minutes for any bags. Once again the 'Priority' bags came off towards the end.,4,1
amman-queen-alia-airport,P Alderson,United Kingdom,I needed to get a visa on arrival but found that unlike some airports I could mention almost all the immigration desks were staffed. I was out of airport luggage in hand 20 minutes after getting off the plane. On the return leg I was able to complete security and immigration checks in a few minutes. There were enough food and beverage outlets and plenty of seating at the gate. As far as airports go this was almost a relaxing experience!,9,1
amman-queen-alia-airport,P Arnold,Jordan,I have flown into QAIA 3 times in the last 3 weeks. On each occasion despite having 'Priority' tagged baggage I had to wait an age for bags to arrive. RJ variously dismiss this as a problem with scanners blaming the new airport's French contractors or delays due to separating arriving bags from transit bags. Otherwise the new airport is a great improvement. Public areas are clean and functional. The lounge upstairs is so much nicer than the old one. Just one more whinge though - why did RJ site their Business Class check in as far as they possibly could from the departure hall and further still from the lounge?,6,1
amman-queen-alia-airport,Mayada Ghannam,Jordan,Excellent Extremely clean lavatories and fast and efficient staff. Definable improved and now meeting international standards the airport is nicer than many European airports.,10,1
amman-queen-alia-airport,E L Wilkes,United Kingdom,Fantastic new terminal incredibly speedy delivery of my bags of the plane and me through security. Excellent. Staff were very polite.,10,1
amman-queen-alia-airport,M Fares,United States,Nice new terminal. Smooth transition through security however security might be more tight than any average US airport but that's common with all Middle Eastern airports. Many restaurants/cafes in the airport. Nice selection in the duty free shop however it's tremendously more expensive than prices of the same items that can be found in the downtown. Took me about 10 minutes to check out at Duty free because of limited checkout counters. The staff at restaurants/cafes seem a little inexperienced however they are very pleasant. Overall I think there has a significant improvement in this airport and I hope it will get maintained well.,7,1
amman-queen-alia-airport,B Quin,Australia,Beautiful new airport. Architecture is stunning. It all ends there. Went through security to check in and waited 11/2 hours for the surly staff to check us in. I had had an injury and required a wheel chair but couldn't contact airport prior to flight. There were no - not one seats- in the waiting area for check in. The doors of the smoking rooms were open with smoke coming out. The toilets were filthy. In one toilet a staff member was sitting on the floor with cleaning materials but the basin areas stalls and toilet were dirty. No paper soap or drying paper.,,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,A Hourani,United Arab Emirates,Beautiful sleek new terminal opened on 21 March completely replaces overcrowded old building. Very modern and compact more immigration counters but slow baggage delivery probably due to initial teething problems but give it a few weeks and this will probably turn out to be the best hub in the East Med / Gulf area if you ask me.,8,1
amman-queen-alia-airport,Drew Keys,Australia,Flew into Amman on Tuesday 12th Feb and out on Sunday 17th. Both flights were on Etihad operating from/to Abu Dhabi. Although officially opened on Thursday it's really still in the soft opening phase (only 4 or 5 flights operating each day from this terminal to ensure all teething problems are ironed out). I always enjoyed travelling through the old terminal which was compact atmospheric and friendly - if a relic from the early eighties! The new terminal is still friendly and compact but elegant and spacious in a way that competes with the world's best. The shops are not fully operational but look like typical airport duty-free with a selection of eating options and lounges that have views throughout the terminal. Passport control (in and out) was swift and efficient as was check-in and security clearance when leaving. As always all staff were courteous and friendly. QAIA is sure to give other hubs in the region a run for their money!,10,1
amman-queen-alia-airport,M Bertram,Australia,One of the worst airports we've been to! Upon arrival we were greeted with an old airport and chaotic queues for currency exchange and immigration. Then at the baggage collection area some staff near the chute were picking up every single suitcase looking for a particular one that they needed to collect. It was irritating to say the least. The airport once again failed to impress when we departed. We only discovered we were in the wrong terminal after going through the chaotic security check and then had to try and explain to the staff that we needed to be in the other terminal across the road and were sent from person to person until finally they let us out. Over at the other terminal we had the same chaotic security check before checking in and facing a long line at the immigration desks. Although the airport looks old and dated the RJ lounge was actually quite new and modern and certainly an oasis after check in.,2,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,J Bridgewells,United Kingdom,This airport is by far the worst airport I have ever visited. Staff were simply rude and the whole check-in system is hugely flawed. I waited 6 hours to even enter the check in area where I was greeted by RJ staff. Furthermore language skills are very poor (for English) and we even noticed one member of staff smoking (surrounded by no smoking signs just about everywhere). The terminal is not great - old and dirty but more importantly staff training certainly needs improvement!,1,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,John Duffus,Thailand,One of the worst airports anywhere although not quite on a par with Kathmandu's Domestic Terminal. Currency exchange desk unmanned for several minutes on arrival resulting in long queue for local currency to purchase visa on arrival. One desk for such visas yet no-one on duty. It turned out we could not see the officer was asleep! Baggage for business class took 45 minutes to appear. Business class departure was initially more pleasant until getting near the gate where the chaos at a second security check and the gate itself was quite appalling. Transit on the way back from LHR to BKK was almost a farce when an Immigration officer accused me of trying to exit Jordan without having a visa despite my showing him by LHR/AMM boarding pass and ticket! It was only when a colleague put him right that he waived me on. Gate management was even worse: just one official taking a good 20 seconds to check each passenger against the manifest of a nearly full A330 and then no priority boarding - just a mad scrum. The new Terminal cannot come soon enough. Unless they provide extensive training for the staff though I cannot see how it will improve much.,,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,C Marconni,China,Amman Airport is one of the worst I've been to and I often travel all around for leisure and business! Impolite staff! Most don't speak English and try to communicate in Arabian. Queue? They don't know what queue is. It is a real mess people coming and going everyone talking at the same time. With lots of connections mostly domestic ones you have to walk outside the building. On one occasion it was raining heavily and all passengers who had to transfer from domestic into international terminal got just wet! I've been here a few times and I don't recommend it at all!,2,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,J Atkins,Australia,Amman is one of the worst airports I have ever been to (I have only transited here). You are only allowed into the gates when your flight is due to board and there is minimal seating in this waiting area (although a reasonable duty free section). Security is a free-for-all scrum with no order whatsoever and planeloads of people pushing and shoving and I have concerns for its effectiveness. The staff appear surly but are friendly when asked. The whole place stinks of smoke staff smoke freely around the terminal especially early in the morning.,2,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,T Patrick,Hong Kong,Awful. Long lines for visas and even for people with visas. Have to have exact change for visa no USD. Lots of men passing huge piles of passports to desk from people at back of line. Place dim smoky and really 3rd world in appearance. Bags not there after waiting 45 mins for Visa and immigration. Duty free shop is quite good though. New airport is on the way - unless they retrain everyone in how to run a busy airport it will be a lovely building staffed by incompetents.,2,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,A Samson,United Arab Emirates,Compact airport starting to look a bit shabby and overcrowded but it covers all the bases decently. Immigration area is small and crowded but we were processed quickly and luggage was already waiting at carousel downstairs so it took less than 30 minutes to be out of the airport in all. Check-in is more of a chore due to overcrowded x-ray area prior to check in again the process is faster than first impression. Decent duty free and lounge. While by no means an impressive airport I have seen much worse hopefully the modern looking new terminal which is being built next door will be completed soon in order to relieve some of the pressure on this one.,6,1
amman-queen-alia-airport,Ian Gilmour,United Kingdom,"Not the smartest airport: two ""terminals"" connected by a shopping corridor. Airport staff and officials can appear sullen but that's only surface - they are usually helpful when needed. The business-class lounge (Crown Lounge) is large and comfortable enough although the food offered is uninspiring. Oddly for an airport/airline trying to build a hub network long haul business passengers arriving in the early hours have to pay to use showers or spend time in a relaxation room. Long connections may or may not entitle you to a nearby hotel room if you are travelling RJ. The visa purchase and immigration queues on arrival can be a trial something the airport and the security/immigration services could iron out quite simply.",6,1
amman-queen-alia-airport,E Connor,Spain,Of all the airports I've visited this one is definitely the most run down with the dirtiest toilets . As previously stated there is an attendant who sits but definitely does not do anything else. As for the rest of the terminal shabby but okay. The cafe was very good serving good quality sandwiches and drinks for a reasonable price and they had free WiFi. Have to say I was surprised by the state of the airport in dire need of a facelift its one saving grace - nice staff.,4,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,L Wallace,United States,Had stopovers in Amman en route to Bangkok and back. The staff was friendly. My complaint is the bathroom - no toilet seats. And despite having a bathroom attendant in there the whole time it really wasn't clean. The bathrooms certainly do not reflect cleanliness and amenities elsewhere in the airport. Airport security couldn't care less about what I took to Thailand but was very strict when returning to the US. They went through my bags and confiscated my tweezers.,3,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,I Petrou,Cyprus,The worst airport I've ever used! The toilets and airport in general were dirty. The staff was rude. At the passport control there was an officer and a friend of his who kept my passport to look every single stamp in it and discuss about the countries I've visited! Then they were asking where my country is (Cyprus). After that duty free was expensive. Such a pity because we liked the country but this airport was the last taste.,2,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,Paul Harvey,United Kingdom,"A colleague experienced the usual scales fiddle with her bag weighing 6 kg more on the return flight than the outbound flight. No amount of discussion could get them to weigh the bag again on another set of scales. Check-in was fast security thorough (three different sets of X-rays and gates before you get to the plane. A very large Duty Free with reasonable prices. WIFI was confusing three different networks seemed to be there one marked ""Free"" which it was not and the others would not respond. Cafes etc plentiful and airport was clean.",4,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,Dave Stanley,,In and out on the BMI flight. The only problem arriving was with customs who are always very strict about what can and can't come in. Departure was no problem. There is a good range of shops and cafe's which were open during Ramadan. The business lounge is very nice with a good range of drinks food and free wi-fi.,3,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,D Zimmer,,Arrived into AMM on Delta from JFK July. Lined up with other US citizens to obtain an entry visa The agent seemed busy looking into his computer while we waited for him to finish what he was doing then another flight arrived and people cut in front of us to get their visas; they were helped immediately by that same agent while we waited and waited. Immigration line for non-Jordanians was very long - even when the line for Jordanians cleared  the agents would not help us so there were 2 long lines for Americans and other nationalities and 6 empty lines where agents just stared at us. I waited 45 minutes to reach the immigration agent. The baggage claim area was chaotic with luggage scattered all over the floor it reaked of smoke and sweat I finally found my luggage buried under a pile. I almost wanted to take the next flight out after that dreadful experience and unhelpful airport officials. Thankfully I stayed in Amman for a few days and found people to be friendly and kind. The airport is a typical third world old and tired place don't expect anything like Dubai Abu Dhabi or even Tunis.,2,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,Andrew Stuckles,,Arrival terminal on an international flight was ok. It looked rundown and a little faded. Still customs was fairly quick and efficient. Baggage retrieval was chaotic but ok. After looking around on various conveyor belts I finally found my bag after about half an hour. On departure airport looked very much different. Modern with a few shops like Starbucks (with free Internet for paying customers) and a few small cafes. Bathrooms were clean and maintained. There is a smoking room for those who are smokers.,4,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,S Collyer,,Overhead announcements are repeatedly saying that smoking is not allowed in the airport. Perhaps not by the travellers but by staff. It was disgusting to see the staff smoking and then crushing the butts on the floor. All staff - immigration staff.,1,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,Dave Stanley,,There is now a decent range of cafes at this airport which includes Starbucks Cinabon etc. They have done some other work to improve it but it could still do with a total refurbishment. The duty free is still good.,4,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,James Chlup,,I have used this airport several times now and have found it adequate. It has some good eating options and the duty free shop is good. The only problem is the lack of seats while you wait for the gate to open. The airport is in need of a facelift which it will hopefully get soon.,4,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,Justin Jones,,I fly twice per month in and out of Iraq through Amman with minimum transits of 5-6 hours. For a modern country like Jordan it's a shame that the first glimpse of that country you get is the run down Queen Allia International Airport. It needs a serious refurb. At 6am you can't even find any toilet paper in the whole airport. The airport is a really bad experience as is the RJ transit hotel! When transiting through Queen Allia bring toilet paper or kleenex baby disenfectant or airline refreshing towels! If lucky enough to fly business the lounges are OK nothing more.,1,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,Iain Williamson,,Always a pleasant experience for this reason with helpful staff at all levels in all areas when arriving/departing/ or in transit.,4,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,Charles Roberts,,A fairly horrible airport although sometimes with helpful staff. There are hardly any places to sit and the security is very tight - which means that you might or might not be able to visit an airline office since you have to enter the area where only departing passengers are allowed. I was lucky and the guard decided to let me through to change a ticket - but gave my traveling companion a hard time. There are few places to sit the bathrooms are quite gross and it's very smoky. The only thing going for it is that the exchange counter by the visa desk offers a rate of exchange often much better than the hotels in Amman. If you are getting a taxi from the airport there are slips with pre-set rates (pretty good) which you should be given when you hire a cab - but that doesn't always happen.,,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,Jim Gould,,For someone who travels frequently through Queen Alia I suggest that King Abdullah do something about the visa system in place. Every time I go through Amman an entire page is used. The size of the visa and the multiple stamps warning to go to the police station after 2 weeks is ridiculous. Institute a visa system with a small stamp that allows tourists multiple entry for a specified period.,,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,Adam Majrouh,,Travelling from Dubai to Amman Via Perth Australia. I Must say on earlier visits to Queen Alia the conditions were horrible but on my latest visit to Amman I was quite impressed at the improvements. The Duty free area is comparable to other international airports and the service was great. Although I must say that seating was limited although I now know that multiple new lounges are being built which are for regular passengers (not only for First class).,,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,James Ghanem,,Travelling JFK to Amman is a long enough flight without having to worry about the chaos once at the airport. Have Jordanian Dinars at the ready for Visas because the lines are long enough. The immigration staff is efficient as they can be on their 15 year old computers that belong in a museum. The rest rooms are a disgrace. However the Jordanian hospitality is wonderful the duty free shop is well stocked and staff knowledgable and pleasant. Pack things to keep you busy because after the duty free shop there is not much else to do. Security very tight.,,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,Ben Weston,,Passed through here on a World Business Class ticket with KLM en route to Amsterdam. Upon arrival the first impressions weren't good. The place looked shabby and worn and the immigration was a little disorganised though mercifully didn't take long compared to places like Dubai. One tip you have to buy a visa which costs 10 JD but the little money exchange counter in immigration didn't seem to be open when I passed through. I'd get your JD's before arriving to prevent big delays if you pitch up when it's closed. The Departure terminal is better but is a far cry from the slick Beirut airport. The duty free section however is very good and the business class lounge is pleasant if a little understocked with food and drinks - the selection is basic. I became a little annoyed at the immigration queues which moved painfully slowly and then the officer closed the desk as I reached the front of the queue!,,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,Dave Stanley,,Most of the comments from other people are accurate. I passed through the airport a few times this month mostly at antisocial times so I was not in the best of moods. There is certainly very little to do in the airport with only basic facilities. The duty free shopping area is good though. I also found the staff to be helpful and efficient. I used the business lounge which was very good and clean (it looked new) with a good snack selection and Internet access. The airport is about 20 minutes from Amman by taxi. The airport runs a fixed fare scheme. Someone near the taxi area should give a ticket with a list of prices so that the taxi drivers cannot con you. The price should be in the region of JOD15-20. Taxi drivers will often try to con the unwary. Journeys inside Amman will cost the locals less than a dinar normally.,,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,Mark Binnie,,I visited Queen Alia Airport in Amman in Sept and flight from London to Bangkok. I agree with Hugo Duran's comments on this site. This airport is an absolute dive. Most people only come here to connect another onward flight. If you have the choice to go via another route and avoid this place - do it.,,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,Jill Grimley,,"We spent time in Queen Alia Airport in April 2004. The shopping area is clean and bright but limited in choice. The sitting areas are limited uncomfortable and not very clean. The toilets I found were smelly dirty and really unpleasant to use (Locks still broken.) Thankfully we were taken out of the airport to a hotel as our flight was delayed by about 6 hours. On our return the ""checking in"" procedure was chaotic. The one good thing I can say is that security is tight.",,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,Hugo Duran,,On our flight change from Amsterdam to Bangkok with Royal Jordanian Airlines we were forced to spend some hours on this airport. I must say this was not a pleasant stay because there is very little to do apart from the brightly illuminated small tax-free shopping area which looks OK. There is enough to see to spend some time. Outside the shopping area there is hardly any thing to do save for some coffee selling points a pizza counter and a France Delight counter where you should think twice to order something to eat or you must be starved in this case anything will help to fill your stomach. The only comfortable seating facilities are situated in front of the France Delight counter but with only about 30 chairs available you find yourself lucky to get a seat. The other places where you can seat are situated close to the gates but these are very uncomfortable and dirty. The local’s are disregarding the non-smoking signs and when you comment to their behaviour they just ignore you and keep on smoking. The male and ladies restrooms are incredible dirty and not well kept. Almost all locks on the doors are not functioning; at the washstand the soap dispensers are out of order you may dip your fingers in the soap containers which are open standing for this purpose on the sink. The faucets are not fixed and rotate in all directions allowed by their flexible connection to the water pipes and in one of the restrooms the electrical cable of the hand- drying unit was inadequately repaired. They just twisted the live wires together and did not insulate the connection thus very dangerous in this wet environment. Although we did spend our waiting time at night in the airport the coolest part of the day it was sticky hot. Our conclusion: Try to avoid this place if possible.,,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,M Malkawi,,With regard to the shopping facilities I support earlier comments about the poor and limited range. In addition even though the prices of international goods appeared fair those of local Jordanian goods are ridiculously high. I noted a recent improvement in the catering facilities that of the Blue Fig counter. The young and very helpful female assistant was pleasant clear and very competent. The capuccino provided was excellent and the price comparable with other international Airports.,,0
amman-queen-alia-airport,Mark Daniel,,Queen Alia is a clean airport but lacks in shops and restaurants. The two terminals are identical making somewhat confusing between the arrivals and departures terminal. The airport is well known for delays that last five hours and Ihave been caught in them. When this happens staff are least helpful lines of people fill the airport and it is hectic.,,0
amritsar-airport,Sukhbir Bolina,Canada,"Amritsar airport is a small, clean and efficient airport. Upon our arrival, we collected our luggage and were out of the airport within 30 minutes of landing. No fuss, no hassle. It is a small airport though, and I hope that they expand this airport as it saves a lot of time - previously we would travel to Delhi which is a whole day journey nightmare. In the departure side, the lounge is way too small with only one shop selling drinks/food. This needs to be expanded. Overall, Amritsar airport is a good experience.",9,1
amritsar-airport,J Samplay,United Kingdom,Disorganised airport worker pushed my parents wheelchair asking for money. Officer were asking us to speak Hindu. Trolleys were all over the place staff were really rude. Only one positive review is that it saves travelling time from Delhi to Punjab again we pay extra for that.,1,0
amritsar-airport,Alan Reeve,United Kingdom,We flew from Delhi to Amritsar on Monday evening 14 October 2013. Within half an hour of landing we had collected our luggage and were out of the airport. As it was a domestic flight there were no formalities. There was no other flights arriving so the airport was empty and the whole experience could not have been better. We did not need trolleys as all our luggage has its own wheels but there were trolleys readily available and the people we saw with trolleys did not appear to have any problems. The friends who were meeting us were able to drive right up to the arrival gate so loading ourselves and baggage into their vehicle was easy.,10,1
amritsar-airport,A Arora,United Kingdom,The Airport has changed its way of working since 2002. It is now a lot cleaner airport with basic amenities available. There was no request from local staff for tips which surprised me on my recent trip. The security staff were friendly and no long queues. There was no charge for drop off near the departure gates which makes life easier. The airport needs to change the trolleys as most of them are broken and outdated. The shops need to sell more varieties of food. The current convenience shop at departures section of airport sells substandard goods. The departure and arrival terminal toilets need to be cleaned more frequently.,6,1
amritsar-airport,S Singh,United Kingdom,I have made 2 trips (2010 and 2012) to India and went through Amritsar Airport. Nice airport clean seating areas got my luggage in 30-40 minutes. Immigration checks while coming out of country are bit odd as they ask so many questions. Toilets are clean. Not so many shops but It does the job very nicely. Not a lot at the airport to entertain you as not many cafes or restaurants but its developing. So give it time.,9,1
amritsar-airport,D S Marbay,United Kingdom,I have travelled to India by Amritsar airport first time. I have saved two days of travelling time (from Delhi to Jallandhar). I was in Jallandhar 2 hrs after landing. I had no problem with immigration checking in checking out etc. I want to see Amritsar airport making more progress and improvements and more flights which will be good for Punjab economy and increase job prospect for local people in the area. I will travel by Amritsar airport in future.,4,0
amritsar-airport,J Phull,,I found Amritsar airport appalling. Disorganised chaos trolleys everywhere and no-one is bothered to move them . Your luggage is being checked through the scanner before you check-in not normal procedure. Washrooms/toilets flooded with water no announcements to boarding the flight no facility for credit cards only cash rupees and no duty free.,1,0
amritsar-airport,A Summan,,Security in Amritsar airport is off the scale - they check and search you about 6 times until you depart which is very time consuming. Baggage belts are poor as in the electricity goes but the back up generator does not fully power the belt so its stops working or goes slower. Luggage usUally takes very long as it is transported by tractor from the aeroplane. Duty free in this airport is very restricted and fairly expensive. Parking facilities are very tight. I don't see Amritsar improving - have been going to India every year and its all the same. I know why major airlines have pulled out of Amritsar.,3,0
amritsar-airport,Mikele Singh,,Airport security is incredibly lax and inconsistent. You initially undergo a brief bodysearch when arriving at the airport. My dad and our driver were both searched but my sister and I were not subject to this search. Maybe they can tell that your not dangerous just by looking at you? Our baggage was not checked when entering the airport. Due to cancellations we had to have our baggage security checked twice. This means you put your own suitcase into a big machine for x-ray while a security official watches a screen as it passes through. This is the baggage you check-in. The first time all bags were aloud through unchecked. The second time one of the bags was flagged as containing a suspicious item. Why was this not flagged the first time? The security staff then wrap security tape around your suitcase to indicate that it has been checked. You then proceed to check- in on your own. This would allow enough time for you to insert dangerous items into your baggage. As far as i'm aware there are no more checks on your checked in baggage. The procedure is flawed. Then comes the second stage of security as you enter the departure lounge where your hand baggage is checked and you as a person. My sister got through with a nail file in her bag. In my opinion as long as you look like you're not a threat to the safety of the hundreds of passengers you're about to fly with you'll get through with anything. The security procedures here need to be over-hauled.,1,0
amritsar-airport,Tony Banwait,,February 2008 - This airport is currently undergoing some major renovation so there's construction mess everywhere. Upon arrival got through immigration fairly quickly and suitcases arrived within 30 minutes. Leaving the terminal building confronted by scores of beggars which I found to be absolutely shameful for the airport authority to allow this. Had to navigate through various mounds of sand to get to our taxi. Departure day had to navigate through the same mountain of construction only to be greeed by throngs of airport security personnel who really don't know what they're looking at when they ask for passport and ticket. Showed wrong e-ticket print out but was still allowed to enter ! No problems through immigration and security. Prior to boarding need to show passport and boarding pass to security official Jet Airways official and Indian government offical in a span of five feet.,1,0
amritsar-airport,Andrew Wilkinson,,I recently visited Amritsar airport for the first time and found it a mixed experience. Clearly undergoing a major expansion the approach roads are something of a building site. Inside the terminal clean tidy but with very limited facilities. Passport control was painfully slow with only two desks open. Yet I was very impressed that on arrival an airport worker noticed I had a bad leg and had some difficulty walking. He immediately offered assistance which was not required,3,0
amritsar-airport,Fred Sandhu,,All comments before the opening of the new airport terminal in 2006 are irrelevant as the old terminal was basically a hut. I flew to and out of the new Amritsar airport terminal. The terminal is a vast improvement over the old. There are still some growing pains such as unfinished drywall and some shoddy construction but the facility is bright and modern with international standards. A few minor improvements like some better paint and better signage would go a long way. Baggage pick-up area is unneccesarily congested with carts obstructing access everywhere. Some common sense applied would help. On the other hand the departure was excellent with no delay courteous staff and a nice general lounge. General cleanliness was an issue but its India.,4,0
amritsar-airport,Deepa Jatt,,My previous visit to this was back in 2005. In comparison my 2007 visit was a great experience - standards have improved beyond expectations. The site now boasts extensive parking on site and a much more modern feel to the whole airport building. The staff were polite helpful and had a good understanding of travellers needs. There were provisions for refreshments and more than adequate seating with the bonus of a satisfactory air conditioning system. Both upon arrival and departure the whole process was swift and efficient.,4,0
amritsar-airport,Davinder Singh,,Amritsar airport has come a long way with the new arrival and departure lounges. Arrival clearance was quick and the baggage arrived on time on the conveyer belts. Check in was swift with the handling agent completing forms. Security was quick also anew bus took as to the aircraft. Jet airways and Singapore airlines fly from the UK and USA  Canada making the trip comfortable. The next phase of the airport will introduce air bridges and other improvements.,,0
amritsar-airport,Ranjit Gill,,The Airport is improving. I have flown to Delhi and Amritsar several times. The treatment by staff is the same where ever you fly in India and the facilities in Delhi are hardly amazing compared to modern standards. I think people forget sometimes that this was never ment to be a civilian airport and is ex- army. I think with time it will only improve but it beats a 9 hour drive any day from Delhi to Punjab.,,0
amritsar-airport,Rana Dhatt,,The facilities were not great but very convenient and you know what they could use a tent for a terminal and I would still go back. Sure beats landing in Delhi and driving to Punjab. The staff was very good particularly the Singapore Airline ground staff.,,0
amritsar-airport,A Khera,,This is the worst airport I have ever had the misfortune to depart from (arrivals although very slow is ok.). Raji Sansi Airport seems to me to be an example of how to cram in as much beauracracy and paperwork into a process as possible. Our tickets and passports were inspected twice before we'd even got in to the airport!. At check- in the staff were extremely rude and un-communicative. The security processes to get through to the departure lounge we're the most convoluted and unnecessary that I've ever experienced with over-zealous staff who don't give a stuff about the customers they're supposed to be serving. The departure lounge is a joke with a tiny counter in one corner where you can by local drinks (limca.miranda etc) for 30Rupees (double the going rate in Amritsar) or you can buy 'imported' canned drinks which because they're imported are priced at a ridiculous 150R - you wouldn't pay that much for a can of mango juice in London even! There is a new bigger airport building being constructed but unless they improve the quality of the staff and services It's just going to be a big mess. Our experiences at Amritsar have meant that my wife for whom this was her first trip to India has vowed never ever to go back. I last went to India 10 years ago and flew from Delhi and that was no problem at all. My opinion at the time was: nice country shame about the people. My opinion remains unchanged.,,0
amritsar-airport,Paul Smith,,I travelled to Armritsar in July 2004 from England with Uzbeckistan Airways. As its seems in India form filling in double triplicate was the order of the day. Although it was night tome the heat was over powering and the airport would benifit from air conditioning. The luggage carousel was in a state of total dissrepair and the bags where thrown through the hole in the wall in a rough style by unseen hands. Next was the customs which if i hadnt have been traveling with an Indian friend i would have found daunting. The money they wanted was not handed over. I agree with another traveller about the lighting outside the airport which is dim to say the least. Things can only get better but if it did not it would not deter me from going to this most interesting city and its friendly people.,,0
amritsar-airport,Paviter S Grewal,,I flew IA into Amritsar in Nov. 2004 via Dubai. Airport Arrival staff was courteous which I wasn't expecting because I have heard horrible stories from others about the staff. I got my luggage intact. But departure was different story; everyone from security personnel to immigration staff was very slow and very rude. As far as facilities go the current airport building is pretty old and not well kept but new building is under construction adjacent the old one. It should be operational sometime before the end of 2005. Let’s hope with new building customer service level will improve. All in all it beats traveling to Delhi. I’m looking forward to flying into Amritsar on my next trip.,,0
amritsar-airport,Gurbinder Singh,,I have used this airport several times now. Each time it seems to get slightly better. Furthermore the new terminal building is due to open in late summer 2005 which will improve things even further. Airport staff at check-in immigration control and security have also improved with their customer service skills. However the only department which needs to improve is customs. Some members of Indian customs can be very petty which can result in heated arguments taking place between passengers and customs officials. The Indian government needs to also address the issue of improving the lighting situation on the main road which goes to the airport. At present it is pitch black at night which can be very daunting during night time.,,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Sabrina Falhaber,Netherlands,"Like many other Dutch people Schiphol is my most frequently used airport. During my last visit it was a pleasure as usual. Things have changed a bit since there is a lot of construction going on this year. The signing is good in general, but returning from my lounge I went the wrong way for a short time because directions to my terminal were missing or I didn't see them but I got back on track in no time. There where some queues at customs, but nothing too bad. The airport is very clean and there are plenty of seats in the terminals and at the gates. They're not very special but good. Before and after customs there is a large variety of shops to get good food and beverages and do some shopping. I even went by the hairdresser before checking in. Most of the staff are very polite and professional and the WifI is fine. There will be many more departures from Schiphol for me to come.",9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Richard Walls,United Kingdom,"I fear that Schiphol airport has forgotten its primary objective, that is to serve its customers, the flying public. The new security arrangements are a retrograde step for passengers with short transit times before flights. 9 times this year I have transited Schiphol Airport from an Air Astana flight from Atyrau to a KLM Cityhopper to Humberside. 8 times I have managed this well within the 50 minute transit time and waited patiently at gate D6. On Friday 31 July 2015 this changed. The Air Astana flight arrived at terminal D on time (which is normal). That's where normality stopped. We had to wait to disembark the aircraft to board a bus which then took us all to Terminal G where we had to negotiate the new security centre. No longer was there to be security at the gate. As a result the normal relaxing stroll from one gate at Terminal D to another turned into a running race for a man of 60. Not only did I arrive at the gate sweaty from my exertions with a pounding heart, I was also emotionally drained for fear of missing my flight on what was my wife's 60th birthday. This was compounded as I heard the last call for me with the threat to remove my baggage (not too much a worry as I only had carry on). I am concerned for the future as with running through Schiphol airport is not a safe activity due to the crowds and I'm not sure that I'll be physically able to do it for much longer. If I do miss my flight, the alternative? An eight hour wait for the next flight if there are seats available! Is Schiphol management willing to accept the consequences of their ill thought out plans for transit passengers with shortish transit times? ",1,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Hadi Alaoua,Malaysia,"This airport is undergoing renovations. Honestly, my 7-hour layover in the airport led me to think that Schiphol is not the airport as it may have been a decade ago. Holland Boulevard is under renovation (and doesn't look nice anymore), so are the museum and the library, extremely overcrowded at McDonald's and at a Starbucks, and there is no place other than at the gates where one can sit and recharge electronics (outlets are extremely limited and some don't even work), internet access is okay but slow and needs renewal every hour. Finally, the lounges are pretty much overcrowded. Schiphol looks like it had better days in the early 2000s and the early 90s. Probably my most memorable experience there was the voice ""mind your step"" at the end of every walkway. Unfortunately, this place is like falling apart for when Amsterdam had rain, parts of the airport ceiling were dripping water, this aging airport needs more than what the current renovation project is working on. And as always, too much traffic (travellers are from all parts of the world), since this airport is a major European hub, yet I doubt that the airport can tolerate this much. If you want a quick layover, this airport might do good (ditch the restaurants unless you have a lot of patience) unless you haven't seen the airport before, but a long one is not worth it at all.",5,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,D Smith,Germany,"If you're tired and hungry and looking for a quiet place to sit down and have a bite in Terminal D then you'd be best to leave the airport. Six months this had been going on and still no improvement. Travelers tend to have bags, and occasionally kids, so it would be nice to be able to sort down for table service after security. Used to be possible upstairs. Overcrowded cafeterias and a pub with standing room only are the choices. By the looks of things, this could run for at least another year. I used to rate Schiphol highly but I'll be flying via Heathrow from now on.",1,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Jon Tydeman,United Kingdom,"Overrated. Having all flights in one terminal is all well and good but it makes for extremely long walks to and from gates. Not at all well thought out. Bad queues in and out at security/passport control. Also, we landed on a remote runway which meant the taxiing to the terminal seemed to take almost as long as the flight itself!",4,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Robert Woeste,Canada,Schiphol is undergoing a major renovation. Air conditioning isn't working at peak efficiency so it gets toasty on the long march to your gate. Past that and given what is being done everything is working well. Could use more signs for car rental return though.,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,P Woo,United Kingdom,Arrivals was quite good not a problem at all. Departure was where it turns ugly. Only two customs desk opened and airlines crew kept on jumping my queue to go through. I understand they can quickly get in by casually waving their passport/document to the custom officer but this should not be at the expense of the other passengers queuing patiently especially when there were more than twenty of them from different flights getting ahead of you. Departure food and shopping is quite nice and I thought I would overlook the customs issue by getting a good takeaway breakfast and eat at the gate waiting area how wrong! Security checking was at the gate (Terminal H) and there was a sign saying no restaurants beyond that point. So I had to throw away my bottle of orange juice purchased just minutes ago that I haven't even opened. I could have downed my drink before going through security but the queue was building up fast (I am actually among the first to turn up at the terminal area after gate info became available) so I tensed up and left the bottle behind at the mouth of the x-ray machine with the security officers. Immediately afterwards I felt so disgusted by this stupid security arrangement (I spent £2.5 for nothing!) I threw away my food in rage as well. (Yes I should have better EQ but you just don't expect this sort of treatment at a major international airport do you?). Once we reached the gate's waiting room we had to queue right away and there were just no seats. Given its global importance I just can't comprehend how Schiphol can fail this miserably and like other negative comments the management should really wake up!,1,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,L Lem,United States,I was born and raised in Amsterdam. I have lived now in the US for 25 years and have traveled back and forth numerous times and always enjoyed it. Last time though it was under construction and indeed a mess. But I am sure it will be even better when they are done. The common discussion on the reviews is the rudeness of the employees at the airport. If you know the Dutch language you know that they are very direct and when translated directly coming from inexperienced speakers it comes across as rude. Even now after many years living in the US I still catch myself being too direct. I have never experienced any rudeness and the employees are always very friendly or at least polite. Looking forward to a new and even better Schiphol.,10,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Ravi Mene,United Kingdom,Recently had a chance to use Schipol as a hub during our visit to Amsterdam. Everything works at this airport the trains planes buses and shuttles. Shopping is very good. There is improvement/refurbishment going on airside to make it even better? The only negative was a very long walk after immigration to reach your gate I like the idea of security check near the boarding area as this reduces the massive bottleneck at the start of your journey. The food joints are plenty and quick. Would use this as hub in future specially from North of England as there are frequent connecting flights.,8,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,K Lau,Hong Kong,My arrival was relatively easy but you could have difficulty using the machines to buy train tickets as they rejected all my 3 international credit cards (visa & amex). Departure was a nightmare. No signs for customs and tax refund counters. Very long queue with just few people in the line (I waited over 30 minutes for Global Blue tax refund with just 6 people in front of me). Poor shopping experience with unhelpful and rude staff at the Fashion & Travel shop. And because of the decentralized security check I was stuck at the gate for over an hour with no food drinks or restroom. My last visit was a very pleasant experience seven years ago. I travel to on average 2-3 European major airports on an annual basis. The deterioration in Schiphol was to my dismay.,5,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Bob Motto,United Kingdom,There is a lot of building work taking place at the moment at this airport it is a complete shambles and mess for all passengers. If anyone is wanting to use the business lounges be prepared for a long walk across roof tops open to the elements. The walk to the British Airways lounge takes about 20 mins so please be aware of this for when you need to get to your departure gate as it will take over 40 mins to get to the D gates. The building work will be going on for a number of months so be prepared for a lot of walking & incorrect signage. If you are looking for places to eat these are few and far between as most have been closed and removed due to the building work.,,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Frank Matsaert,United Kingdom,I found this airport poorly run. First there is nobody manning half the transfer desks (e.g. At T9) second my flight was cancelled and they put me in an airport hotel that was actually 20km from the airport they gave incorrect information and finally the security staff are the most rude I've come abroad in 20 years. Avoid this so called efficient airport at all costs it's badly run!,1,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,M Taylor,Hong Kong,Big airport with good [but as usual expensive] rail connection to Amsterdam proper and relatively cheap premium local beer airside departures. The annoying thing is the security-at-the-gate which always annoys me but otherwise I think this airport is reasonable for it's size and location. As others have noted there is some walking required - but I don't understand people's insistence that when travelling 10000km they should not have to walk a single pace without some kind of mechanical assistance. I don't mind walking it's usually faster than the moving walkways with groups and couples standing willy-nilly in the middle on the left and on the right all at the same time while enjoying the skin-crawlingly-slow pace of crawling forwards towards their destination.,7,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,J Atravel,Switzerland,A thoroughly shoddy experience. Very long walk to connecting flight with travelators not working. Then officious staff trying without success to place cabin baggage in the hold. But the biggest disappointment of all was the fact that there was nowhere to site in the departure gate because the airport is so far behind the development of larger long-haul aircraft. So more people than seats - and no opportunity to sit and relax before the flight.,,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,P Kniebusch,South Africa,It is surprising how an airport can change during renovations. It is one large building site at the moment between terminal E and F. Therefore it means that passengers have to walk long ways where in the past they had conveyor belts. But I am sure that it will change again after they have finished. For the time of renovations we have to live with these problems. On the Schengen site I loved the roof garden. It is a perfect place to enjoy.,8,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Nick Lester-Davis,United Kingdom,Definitely going downhill as an airport. A long walk with no assistance from the railway station to the passport control followed by another very long walk - about 15 minutes - to the airport lounge which included climbing a flight of stairs and a 5 minute walk along a rough shelter on the rooftop. Then the same in reverse as part of another 15 minute walk (with one travelator for a short section) to get to the gate. This was not helped by the airport deciding to test the fire shutters in the middle of the afternoon which made everyone wait for 15 minutes while they came down were tested and then went up again. This airport is now just too big.,2,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,W McKenzie,United Kingdom,This used to be my favourite airport but the security arrangements for non Schengen departures (security at the gate) have actually made Heathrow look a more attractive option - and that's something I never thought I'd write. Complete chaos from beginning to end. Locked gate nowhere it sit massive queue no room to prepare for check no room to reassemble myself after check then called for boarding to be shuffled through to a smaller area where everyone stands (because there are only 8 seats) for 20 minutes awaiting permission to board. Appreciate the terminal is undergoing renovations but I don't think those have anything to do with the dog's breakfast of security that those traveling to non schengen destinations have to endure. And to make it worse I was transiting having already undergone security at my initial point of departure.,2,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,S Lubis,Indonesia,First time transiting in Amsterdam after many years the Airport is undergoing massive renovation and it really is inconvenient. Have 4 hours to kill but not too many food options available and we ended up in McDonald's as this seems the most familiar choice. As an Asian would prefer to have Asian food available at the Airport but there seems no choice for this except for a sushi place which is very crowded at that time. The place looks like a mess due to the renovation and we have to walk quite far via a narrow and dark corridor to a more decent area for transit (the Holland Boulevard) to do some last minute duty free shopping. Hopefully the renovation will make Schiphol one of the world's best again. One of the good thing about the Airport is the availability on toilet inside the gate holding room which is very convenient before you board the plane.,6,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,A Leinenkugel,United States,I have traveled all over the world and this was by far the most tiring experience. This was my first experience at Schiphol and I do not recommend it I will be utilizing other international hubs in Europe even if it costs me more money to do so. I was transferring to another plane in Schiphol and while a 2 hour transfer window at any other airport would have warranted time to eat and have a drink it was barely enough time to get on the plane. As such while the facilities looked decent I cannot comment on the food and drinks. I am not sure how this airport is rated so highly but as many others have stated Schiphol is horrible because of the following: Passport Check lines chaotic and slow for non-EU passports (40 minutes). Security personnel are rude (would not be as big of a deal if you didn't have to deal with them so often). Check-in at the gate is 1.5 hours before flight because of the ridiculous decentralized security process. Once again this is a transfer not the initial security check at your first airport. Security interview at gate - seriously this is a first for me and everyone must go through it and is absolutely a waste of time (1 hour with a short line in front of me). Removal of everything in my carry-on - as a traveling consultant I have 2 laptops a tablet a phone and all the necessary chargers headphones and adapters which means everything comes out into clear plastic bags. Yep I needed 3 of them. Luckily I avoided having to wait in the purgatory room after security and prior to boarding as I was one of the last people on the plane. My hard shell checked luggage was cracked open the entire length of the bag. This may have not been the airport's fault but I'll chalk that up to KLM. Schiphol is now my number one airport that I avoid.,,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Ian Sinclair,United Kingdom,Traveled from Schiphol airport on 16 Feb despite its great PR machine working overtime to convince us that it is a flagship operation this week it resembled a rather shambolic building site. The renovations are of a significant size causing passengers to walk extremely long distances to reach airline lounges. Why couldn't KLM position a lounge closer to the D/E gates? (Or is this yet another way of saving money by assuming that a significant number of passengers will not bother or have the time to hike halfway across the airport to find the downsized facilities?). I am planning to avoid Schiphol until this project is completed it really is a miserable experience.,1,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Mark Ellwood,United Kingdom,Really great Airport to transit Some long walks from different piers but nothing any problem. Loads of places to eat and fabulous choices of food. Amazing shops with everything you could want great for Diamonds and high end watches. Really would recommend anyone thinking about a European airport transit point. Some staff at gate areas rude but that's just human nature.,10,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,R Jones,United Kingdom,It been years since I last used Schiphol. It runs quite smoothly and waiting times are minimal. However the lack of clear signage - even for a seasoned traveller is a concern. I had no idea which way to go for the exit but followed the general masses of people heading that way. Departure area D has two signs pointing in opposite directions. Signage in the rail station is even worse so again follow the general crowd arriving.,5,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,L Michele,United States,"Horrible. Security is at the gate. They make you take out everything electronic (even my flat iron had to come out). I was just in layover here transferring to another country. The ""pre check"" they make you go through is ridiculous. They question you about where you've been and where you're going. Keep in mind this was not immigration or customs! Just the gate attendants before you catch your flight. Everyone rude. Will never get a connecting flight through this airport again. After you go through the questioning and the security they then huddle everyone into the tiniest waiting rooms ever to wait to board the flight. Most people didn't have seats. They really need to come up with better systems for pretty much everything here.",,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,R Dijkstra,Netherlands,An airport that ranks consistently amongst the best. The co-operation between the airport and the home carrier KLM is flawless. Checked in online and without Luggage to check in I walked from the train station straight to immigration cleared within 2 minutes and was on my way to the gate. Yes Amsterdam Schiphol is a large airport but moving walkways are available at each pier. I arrived at the gate and found a seat and used the one-hour free Wifi Internet. This came with a reasonable speed. On arrival back at AMS a few days later it was again quite a large distance to immigration and baggage claim. Immigration is amongst the best in Europe friendly fast and efficient. Luggage took about 15 minutes but after that it was straight to the station underneath the main hall. Excellent large airport in every respect. If only others in Europe and the US would take the time to learn from them.,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,T Smith,Canada,I flew in on KLM from Canada. Arrival was good. There were short queues for customs. Baggage arrived in reasonable time. My departure was another story. Security clearance was done at the gate. As a result you have to be at the gate an hour and a half before departure. The aircraft was a 747 - very long queues. Once through the we were herded into a small waiting area. There were not enough seats. Passengers were standing shoulder to shoulder. A delay was announced. We were told to remain seated. As only about ten percent had a seat this produced ironic laughter. There was one washroom in the entire area. No water fountain or drinking water. We stood for forty five minutes. I would happily arrive at Schipol. I will avoid departures from there.,2,0

amsterdam-schiphol-airport,A Corsoni,Italy,Passed through Shiphol Airport several times lately its a big airport and it offers several shops and possibilities to fill a couple hours between flights. Immigration has been fast compared to other airports but I noticed that it took a bit more time for those holding non EU passports. However Immigration personnel (and I mean just immigration) was pleasant and welcoming. All that is quickly forgotten when time comes to deal with the rest of the airport staff: in stores they are rather unwelcoming but the worst comes with the Security checks staff which are the worst i ever seen (and I travel back and forth from North America to Europe and Asia). Security staff at Shiphol Airport are definitely rude to outright offensive towards passengers which most of the times are either too tired/worried to protest. The fact that they aren't that efficient just add frustration to the already bad experience.,,0

amsterdam-schiphol-airport,J Flynn,Ireland,Passed through/transferred twice this week. Ridiculous walking distance for the less fit in our group. Once again experienced the aggression of the Dutch traveller - happy to bump into you and 'educating' airport users re walking on the right side. Lack of services especially for eating - and signage very poor. Going through security they're pushing you for no good reason - except maybe as little power trip. The flight was late (probably airline's fault) half the passengers could not hear the local announcements there were 4 staff members at the desk 1 working and the others looking bored. Overall a tiring experience - and compared so badly with Helsinki Airport which is brilliantly laid out chilled and courteous.,2,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,R Scholten,Netherlands,Absolutely the airport I prefer. Mostly I originate from this airport but I have used it also 2 times for connections (transfer).

amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Tom Verduin,Netherlands,We flew from our national airport to Istanbul Atatürk on Turkish Airlines. We checked in online. That was an excellent choice since the waiting queue for Turkish's check-in desks (only 3 open) was the longest I've seen at Schiphol (about 300m). We dropped our bags at the business class counter. This all went really fast. The queue for passport control however was very long. Only one desk was open. We dropped our bags 2 hours prior departure but after passport control we just had time for a quick cup off coffee before the final boarding call so we rushed to the gate which was a 20 minute walk. When we arrived at the gate boarding hadn't even started however the screens already said 'gate closed'. The boarding queue was just as long as the passport control line and it took us 35 minutes to reach the jetway. We had to clear security and just another passport control before entering the plane. Again only one (of two) lines were in operation. We left the gate 10 min. late and we were in a long queue for takeoff (approx. 9 planes) for runway 09. We took off exactly an hour late but nonetheless arrived 2 minutes early at Atatürk where an even more unpleasant experience awaited us.,6,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Padmakumar Ramachandra Rao,India,The best in the world. Clean clear instructions and tons of facilities prompt service train connection and ticket service from inside the airport no hidden charges and most importantly missing in many airports a cash machine!,10,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Kevin Tunnicliffe,United Kingdom,Check in kiosks worked well and there were plenty of them. Only problem was that as well as our own boarding passes it gave us someone else's as well. It just churned it out after ours. Queues for the automated bag drop machines were horrendous and would have been cut by maybe 75% if there had been more than one staff member allocated to help those who had not done this before. Weird system of going through security at the gate meant that people were having to abandon soft drinks they had purchased after clearing passport control and because the process of doing security at the gate is obviously time consuming people were at the gate with no access to drinks or toilets for up to an hour before they were boarded onto the aircraft and there were too few seats for the amount of passengers.,6,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Dmitry Kuzin,Russian Federation,I didn't like anything about my layover in AMS. Moreover the terminals were under construction. At night it was chilly there because of A/Cs working all the way. Crowded everywhere. Cars carrying disabled and seniors go very fast and almost run over people walking on foot making them step aside all the time. Not many seating areas. Duty free shops are ok. Security checks should be passed right by the boarding gate. Staff do not seem to be efficient. Add weird navigation to that and you will get a bad airport for a long stop-over.,4,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,M Johnson,United States,"How crazy is it to have security checks at the boarding gates. Things are crazy enough when 300 plus people are lining up to board. And talk about rude security people. Coming in from Manchester and connecting to Portland OR we had to pass security again at the boarding gate. We put our things on the x-ray conveyor and proceeded to the whole body scanner. When I exited the scanner I was met by a young man who begins by saying ""Did you not hear my colleague tell you to empty your pockets."" And from then on he was sarcastic and demeaning about my ability to follow ""orders."" I admit that I had items in my pockets (wallet passport pen and my mobile). In all the chaos of the boarding gate I had neglected to remove them for the scanner. If I had had the time I would have sought out his supervisor. Schiphol Airport has advanced to the top of my list of airports to avoid at all costs.",,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,G Ducrettet,France,I had to pass through Schiphol yesterday evening I would like to reiterate the nightmare organisation of this airport firstly I came from Edinburgh and on the TV it marked gate M for my next flight to Geneva no signs anywhere marked M I asked 3 officials before they explained I have to go out of the arrivals after a 20 min walk then re enter turn right still no M marked. Finally I saw an M when I entered the departures this is the first airport who doesn't seem to want to make things clear for transfers. At gate M after turning my head for a minute to buy some water the Geneva flight disappeared no explanation nothing we had to ask the security what had happened he had to check on his Iphone and said there was probably a gate change we had to exit the gate and walk for another 20 mins and I walk fast to D my bag had passed with no problem the security at M however this time at D gate they stopped my bag and made me leave some things I had bought (which had also passed the security in Edinburgh also). A rude security officer wouldn't listen to the fact that we had come from another gate and seemed indifferent to our requests. Why was it necessary for us to come out of security and re enter most airports you enter and that's it even if gate changes. I would advise people to transfer through another airport if possible Edinburgh is very nice and well organised.,,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Edward Michaels,United Kingdom,Chaotic security many staff are just plain rude and this is a dismal airport to transfer through. The walking distances are ridiculous. My transfer airside from G gates to a D gate highlights the poor standards here at Schiphol and then the usual 15 mins trek to find a distant runway that seems like it's in Belgium. This is definitely an airport to avoid if you can. Dirty overcrowded facilities and just generally unpleasant.,1,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Hans van den Brink,Netherlands,I am amazed this airport often gets high ratings. Shops are alright but much too expensive. Immigration is red tape at the top. Baggage handling for incoming passengers is a horror movie come true. This is an airport to be avoided.,3,0

amsterdam-schiphol-airport,David Graham,United Kingdom,I am aware that many reviewers are high in their praise for this airport but I find it so big and the so-called single terminal layout so cumbersome that I often dread having to fly to and from Schiphol. On a recent flight from London-City airport we landed on the‘remote’runway so had to endure a 10-15 minute taxi to the gate. Once we got there the gate was stilled occupied so has to wait for another allocation (typical for this airport). Once we pulled up to the new gate we had as usual to wait for what seemed like ages for the jetty to dock with the aircraft then the endless walking and travelators to immigration added another 10 minutes to the journey. Luckily the immigration was very fast. So given a 40 minute flight from London we spent at least 35 minutes taxiing disembarking and endless walking. I don't find this airport at all suitable for shorter commuter type flights. It may be great for international transfers but for a quick trip from the UK to work in Amsterdam it adds significantly to time and stress.,2,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,B Pico,Ecuador,On March 15 connecting in AMS from GVA to UIO. Chaos happened at Immigration: no lines exist only one airport agent was there but could do nothing to create lines no explanations given. Amazed that an airport as Schipol was unable to organize the situation in which hundred of connecting passengers were left to try to board their flights with that big chaos by their own. This created that my outbound flight was delayed almost an hour. Luckily KL decide to delay the flight to wait for passengers. Not good customer service at AMS Airport: no information given no lines at Immigration not organized free Wi-Fi doesn't work. Is this really one of the best airports in the world?,3,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Alexander Mokretsov,Russian Federation,Excellent airport. Very efficient transit lots of space for sitting and relaxing great self-service check-in zones. Wonderful bars and cafes with good food and drinks. Very comfortable Internet access zone. Absolutely excellent shopping experience. Probably the best European airport I have been to so far.,10,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,H Oberbeckman,Germany,Had a really good experience at AMS. On transfer from a transatlantic flight to a short feeder flight in Europe we experienced very short queuing times. There are a lot of power outlets within the waiting areas and free wifi in a lot of areas. Shops and restaurants are also available. The Terminal was clean and due to the size of the airport it's not necessary to walk far between gates.,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Eric McPherson,United Kingdom,Often depend on a transit airport for my onward flights from the UK to elsewhere in the world) which means we really only have 4 choices from my home airport Manchester which are Heathrow Paris Frankfurt or Amsterdam. Lately we started using Amsterdam simply as it is the best of all the 4 main hubs in Europe and we really enjoy spending some time there. Frankfurt doesn't inspire Paris CDG is a rubbish place to spend some time just a soulless place (unless you have lounge access I guess which we don't have) and we tend to no longer fly BA as it's just to expensive to the destinations we regularly fly to. That leaves Amsterdam and we tried it a few times now and really like it. There's just so much to see and do the range of shops eateries and places to relax are awesome and every pier has something else to offer there's even a museum and if you have the chance to go through customs to go to the railway station you're greeted by a rather large shopping mall as well. Some airport staff recommended we went through customs to go to the roof terrace where we found to our surprise that an airport was parked on the roof for the public to see really cool. I do agree to some comments that security staff at the gate need to learn some manners as some of them are just awful. I guess that's down to translation issues but the Dutch clearly have to learn to add the word 'please' to their vocabulary it just makes all the difference. Airport staff needs to give security staff some proper training as some have very limited English and as a result sound very rude. Overall KLM airline staff are always pleasant to deal with they really stand out from other airlines it is really noticeable. But back to the airport by far the best airport to kill some time in Europe if you depend on a transit airport. Explore it walk around a bit and you come across lots of great places restaurants and bars also on the upper level.,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,P Cullen,United Kingdom,I generally like Schiphol it is large and busy but well laid out and has plenty of facilities and never feels particularly crowded. I have generally found queues short and staff helpful. However my most recent experience was rather less than perfect because KLM has introduced some very short transit times. Going out was 55 minutes and on return 40 minutes. The first was just doable but the second very stressful and I only made my flight by jumping a queue (on instruction from staff) and running the last part (I was not alone). The problem is exacerbated if you are on short-haul Cityhopper flights which park away from the terminal and require a bus to and from them this reduces the transit time by at least 10 minutes. On the second occasion my second flight was 'now boarding' as I got off the bus from the first flight and 'gate closing' appeared when I was still some minutes from having my boarding card checked and going through security. This was despite going straight to the gate at a brisk walk anyone unfamiliar with the airport or unable to keep up a good pace would really struggle. In the end Schiphol worked but I found the experience unnerving and I caution transit passengers with less than hour between flights to be ready for a stressful experience.,6,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Andrew Wilson,Norway,There is everything one could want and more in Schiphol. Airside there are hotels a museum casino restaurants good selection of shops smoking rooms and more bars than you could shake a fist at. My favourite airport to spend any length of time in.,10,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,S Smith,United States,Used to be a better place to fly but security is very unprofessional as many other reviewers stated. I don't have issues with the airport itself. Clean decent options for eating (although quite expensive) nice restrooms nice areas to relax and work. On the flip side get ready to be harassed. There is now a full-body scanner at each gate so you are expected to be at your gate an hour and a half early versus the customary 45 minutes at normal airports and even after the full-body scan at the gate you may be subjected to the pat down. For all the things this airport has going it is definitely the worst when it comes to unprofessional and rude security personnel.,3,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Yevheniy Kahanovych,Ukraine,I used AMS for arrival departure and transfer from non-EU to EU and vice versa. I was impressed with the overall organization (partly thanks to KLM) very reasonable immigration queues very fast security processing baggage transfer. Another important thing was plentiful and clean toilets. Signage was also a pig plus: clear and often. The building despite being huge Is nice and well kept. Boarding process was also ok. Security search was way too thorough but this is for our own sake. The only two disappointments were railway ticket machines that refuse to accept foreign credit cards (not the airport's fault) and rip off drink prices. Since liquids are not allowed through security prepare to pay 2.6 euro for 0.3l bottle of Evian. Shopping didn't impress me either. Overall great for flight. This is what it is needed for.,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Diarmuid Curran,Malaysia,January 5 2014 3 years since I last used Schipol. Their staff were exceptional. It would be easy to criticise when things go wrong as they did before. But when the entire process was so efficient so smooth and seemed tailored to getting the job done one knows its working even though one is not so sure. The staff knew there were problems and went 200% of the way to remedying them. 30/31 December 2010. Due to adverse weather conditions my flight was delayed and if it could go wrong it seemed to go wrong. After all it was a severe winter in Europe DUB-AMS was delayed and I missed my connection to Kuala Lumpur. The right hand did not seem to know what the left was doing. To be honest I'd say I was unlucky in terms of how 'tight' my connections were and my own advice would be to allow 2 hours minimum in any Airport to allow for contingencies. It was the same in September and January 2010 and since then I switched my patronage to Etihad. I'm impressed. KLM and Schipol are now back in my good books.,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,T Whittington,Sweden,One of the best airports in the world and comparable to Asian benchmarks such as HKG. Most recent time I used the airport two days ago I was late and arrived at the airport 2pm by train and made it at C04 at boarding 2.15pm. Security was very fast think they even upscaled a bit for the expected traffic due to Christmas. Unfortunately there was no time left to grab a bite or do some Christmas shopping but airport has sufficient places for that. In the past I have experienced once or twice (in my case <5% of times traveled through the airport) 45 minute wait for the luggage which was too long don't know what happened there the other occasion customs took too long but apparently it was a sudden peak and it took some time to call some extra staff. These two occasions however are not representing the overall performance. The walking distance are normally fine you can be unlucky when you have a stopover and need to go from H peer to B that will take a good twenty minutes. But that shouldn't be a problem for the average healthy person. Still better than a train or worse shuttle bus. So looking at the numerous experiences I had at Schiphol great airport.,10,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,F Alesch,Austria,Very bad experience customer unfriendly awful security check. Maybe good for shopping addicts but not for serious flyers.,2,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Armando Urrio,Switzerland,Queues are really too long and security checks are very suspicious. It takes hours to cross the airport. Luckily it is clean and staff are quite nice.,5,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,J Wix,United Kingdom,I found the Schengen to non Schengen transfer in both directions had long queues at passport control I needed the 45/50 minute transfer time. On the way from UK I was given my Schipol gate by helpful staff but not at Madrid or on the plane. People had to push to the front to get their transfers (very politely). People got agitated at D gate though and one very rude English woman impatiently asked me for a gate number (at 64 with a suitcase and rucksack - do you think I looked like an airport official).,5,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,S Majid,Malaysia,Chaotic. Confusing layout. Perhaps in the same league as Heathrow Airport. Definitely way below Changi or Zurich airport. My take is that Schiphol may have reached its handling capacity. It this is not true then blame it on the security check and passport control. These are the ones that are causing pain to the passengers. Will definitely avoid this airport in future trips. Prefer to use Zurich as entry point into Europe.,,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Willem Jansen,Netherlands,Good airport lost of destinations clean. However taxi's are the worst you can get in Europe. Avoid these and take public transport or ask friends to pick you up.,7,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Pieter Boone,Netherlands,Although this airport is far above average I have been annoyed by a few disturbing 'patterns'. My last few arriving flights could not be accommodated at a gate right away because 'the ground staff had not arrived yet'. Even though the delay was less than 10 minutes I find this very strange none of the flights were early and taxi times after landing are extremely long (15 minutes or more) so I gather this should be enough notice. It also seems that connecting a jet bridge at Schiphol takes way longer than any other airport and ground staff seem to struggle moving the jet bridge having to make a few tries before doing it right. Schiphol is a large airport and the fact that 'moving walkways' leading back to the terminal almost always are out of use is just unacceptable. What is the problem? Signs say they are out of use for 'maintenance' but I never see anyone working on them.,6,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,C Kupper,Malaysia,Probably the best airport in the world! All processes link everything is smooth. Staff are very friendly.,10,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,D Engl,Switzerland,Did a few passes through the Airport either starting my journey there or just connecting. KLM check in is anything other than customer friendly. The self baggage check in takes so much time almost everybody needs assistance. If they would use these employees (counted 5) at normal check in it would speed up the whole process and it would be more personal. The security check is by far the most awful I have seen most unprofessional unfriendly people working there. Hope your Gate is not one of the far out on the concourse otherwise you will miss your flight. My advice avoid Amsterdam Schipol if possible.,1,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,C Graham,United Kingdom,I like flying KLM however I find Schiphol such a poor airport compared to others in Europe. The shopping is poor with generic duty free shops found in any airport across the world. Very few specific shops. However the thing I dislike the most is that each gate has its own security meaning you can't buy a bottle of water after security to take on the plane. I drink a lot of water and find it helpful to take a bottle on the plane and at several airports I use you clear security and then are able to shop around and buy water however with security being right at the gate it is impossible.,5,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,E Lang,Switzerland,I don't like Schiphol airport. Every time we have a layover its a pain. We check in at the starting airport go through check-in security are all that rubbish until we board the plane (usually KLM) that takes us to Schiphol. When we are there we have to go again through security and check-in and twice did they take things away from us. Apart from that you have to queue everywhere and there is no space for queuing. I will avoid Schiphol when ever possible.,2,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Judith Wotherspoon,Australia,I last visited this airport in 2006 and chose to come back this year. It is efficient and well sign-posted and I like the train being so easily accessible although this time it was luck which got me to the right platform to catch the train to the centre of Amsterdam. Signage and ticket purchase were not as straightforward as I expected. Baggage pick up was slow from my flight and there was a jam of people waiting for the exit gates etc. I still like it and will come again.,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,S Taylor,Canada,I am frustrated every time I use this airport because of the chaotic line ups when departing. There is often a very long disorganized line up for passport control and the security control is at the gate for international flights. I spend 30 minutes getting through and then you end up in a small waiting room with no chance to buy any liquids for the flight. This time I got a seat but many of the people after me had to stand another 20 minutes before boarding the plane.,6,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Patrick Tan,Malaysia,This is probably the best airport I have used so far in Europe. Flew in from Barcelona into Schiphol and Schiphol to Dublin. It is probably the most convenient airport with their self check-in kiosks and self drop baggage counters. The airport does look a little old now but still very well-maintained. The only thing that I think can be improved is the immigration counters and queuing areas. Unlike other European airports all airport workers here were very professional. Overall very satisfied with this airport and will definitely choose Schiphol as the gateway into Europe in future.,8,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,J Nissinen,South Korea,A very easy to use airport. The only minus point would be the often long and chaotic lines at the immigration both sides. The lines for people with EU passports should be respected and reserved for the EU passport only. Lounges are very clean and the food is fresh and tasty. Staff is general extremely professional and helpful. Shopping is excellent. Gates are easy to find.,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Bob Kimmings,Australia,This is one huge terminal instead of the usual scattered smaller ones. You can walk a long way if you choose the wrong direction but it is very well sign-posted clean and very efficient. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable. I enjoyed the food and the Panorama Terrace.,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,L Osman,United Arab Emirates,First time using Schiphol and was a bit disappointed. Found it a bit like an airport from the 70s it is sufficient and massive and has everything but needs a face lift renovating operation. I couldn't understand why arrivals and departures are in the same place it was a bit confusing. I spent some time at the duty free upon arrival so didn't have any queues at passport control. Very well connected with train station buses and all public transport. On departure I checked in online for my Emirates flight however I spent sometime at passport control which was long and slow with only 4 counters. Duty free staff were very friendly and helpful toilets were in very bad condition. The screening and security was too long due to the fact it is a massive A380 aircraft with 500 passengers luckily I was seated in the second row at the front of the aircraft so I took my time and boarded last. All in all a pleasant sufficient airport and will use it again.,7,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Chris Lewis,United Kingdom,I used to like flying through Schiphol but I've completely gone off the place. Best part of an hour to get through immigration on arrival flying back from there you can't go through security screening and then relax with a drink or meal because you're on tenterhooks all the time waiting to be called forward for screening from the lounge area. When you finally do struggle through screening there are very few facilities; what you do have is a long walk and shuffling forward in a queue on a flight of stairs to board your plane. Even Heathrow is a more comfortable experience these days.,,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,H Gibbs,Netherlands,If Airports were judged solely by the cleanliness of the toilets them Amsterdam Schiphol would come out best. They are spotless. Often there are very long queues for passport control when entering NL from outside a Schengen area. Schiphol is getting very big and one has to look carefully for the way out signs and signs to baggage reclaim due to adverts everywhere.,10,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Ian Loftus,Australia,"AMS is generally a pretty good airport but the dreadful system of herding passengers into small gate lounges on F pier is annoying. Why can't security screening be done just before/after immigration and then there will be no need for the gate lounges (shouldn't the whole airside be ""sterile"" anyway?). Passengers would then actually be able to use toilets have a coffee go shopping etc for longer rather than being locked up.",7,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Rob Smit,China,A pleasant and efficient airport for both short and long haul as well as flying with budget airlines. Immigration queues are short or non-existent. Security check usually have a bit longer queues but even then the line keeps moving quickly. Plenty of shops and restaurants on both air side and land side. A great airport.,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,N Barnsley,Spain,A clean well planned and user-friendly airport with efficient and courteous staff minimal queues at security and short waits at baggage reclaim. Only let down on a recent trip was the poor business class lounge used by KLM for their inter Schengen flights.,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Mark Kemper,United States,This airport is a decent place to make a connection. I have only used it 2 or 3 times as a terminal or originating airport but I have used it 2 or 3 dozen times for connections. The negative is that it can take a very long time to get from one gate to another which can be very difficult if you have a short connection. However if your time is sufficient it is a good airport with good facilities. The KLM Lounge is fabulous after its most recent upgrade. But the general facilities are also good as there are several shopping and food options available to occupy your time. The coffee shops are especially good. This airport is configured such that security checks are performed at each gate on a flight-by-flight basis. The process is reasonably efficient. The immigration checks can get backed up but things usually move at a reasonable pace and the staff are polite and fairly efficient. Signage in the airport is relatively good and flight boards are not too difficult to find. The personnel at the transfer desks are relatively helpful if information is required. There are areas to lounge comfortably on the second level if you have a longer period of time. In all this is a very convenient airport for transit.,8,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Mike Jacques,United Kingdom,My first time through this airport as a transit passenger. Well sign-posted but does not have a friendly feel about it. Food and drink expensive. I would use the airport again to avoid Dubai when flying to Australia/Far East.,5,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,D Bokr,Germany,I like travelling through AMS. I find the spacious airport well stocked with restaurants bars shops etc. Most of the staff are friendly and cheery. Most of the immigration officers are grumpy. I have never encountered a long line at immigration or security.,8,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,P Cullen,United Kingdom,Transited from non-Schengen to Schengen area flight with little difficulty about a 10 minute wait to have my passport checked and maybe 3 minutes at security. The facilities are excellent plenty of seating with views over the airport and many different food outlets and shops (though they are not cheap). I had a quite complicated question about my return journey (which was not through Schiphol) and the staff were very helpful and efficient in finding the answer. A good experience.,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Jen Brown,United States,Had a transfer here on my way to and from Africa from NYC this month. Overall the airport is new clean and has a variety of shops and dining options. Dining options are a bit expensive. I can't say anything about the passport control as I was only passing through and didn't have to deal with that but the individual security lines at each gate seem inefficient. I had to wait 45 minutes to board the plane because there are only 2 x- ray machines even for the huge 747 I was on. The other issue with having it at the gate is that you aren't allowed to bring any liquids including duty free alcohol or a bottle of water to drink on the plane. An 8 hour flight is pretty dehydrating. I think this may be a US rule only so check before you try to buy anything to bring anything onto the plane.,6,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Giacomo Gramazio,Italy,I travelled to/from Schiphol twice in the last few months and it's an excellent airport. Baggage delivery was fast and indications were clear. Transportation to/from the city is straight and bus line 197 takes only half an hour to get to the centre at a reasonable cost (€4 one way). When departing I used KLM's self check-in and baggage drop off facilities which are very user friendly. Short queues for the security checks. The facilities airside are the best I've seen in Europe and there is a good selection of shops and restaurant. Pity that the prices are a bit too high. All in all an excellent airport that I may decide to use in the future for intercontinental flights too.,10,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,J Martin,United States,This has got to be the worst airport for disabled persons and customer service skills. A disabled passenger should have a wheelchair waiting outside the plane which has been a common sight at other international airports but Amsterdam airport was the worst making the passenger walk to the entryway of the airport and then onto a trolley. No wheelchair access whatsoever! On top of this the customer service skills of the representative were nil. She was outright rude pushing my hand aside as I pointed forward to ask if the gate was up ahead. Who do you complain to when the airport lacks common sense anyway? If you are looking for assistance for a disabled person then I would suggest avoiding this airport altogether.,,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,P Apling,United Kingdom,Poor communication and a lack of departure information monitors. For an ultra modern airport I was very surprised to see such steep and dangerous steps leading down to boarding gates which are extremely unsuitable for young children and elderly passengers. Grand Cafe Plaza possibly the worst cooked breakfast. For two breakfasts a tea a coffee and a bottle of still water we were charged an extortionate €34.95 for a meal which was extremely sub-standard. Next stop the Internet cafe. €3 gets you 15 minutes of nothing as I tried two different keyboards with faulty keys. Absolutely no departure information regarding our EasyJet flight back to London Gatwick. I had to go to an information desk instead. We were told to go to lounge H a 20 minutes walk from the main lounge. Having passed through passport control and a full body X-ray we were greeted by three airport workers conducting a questionnaire. We were not given the option of volunteering we were hijacked into it and I have to say that the questions were absolutely ridiculous. They could see that I was in a hurry and they were not interested in the lack of departure information or the steep and dangerous steps. I cannot say that I would want to visit this airport again. It's huge with plenty of faults.,4,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Kai Schlender,Germany,AMS is one of Europe's main hubs but unlike confusing FRA or crowded LHR quite well-arranged and clean. Although big the terminal is one coherent building and good signposted so no annoying terminal change. For me it's been the best transfer airport I've ever been by now. No long queues at security. Very friendly staff. Cafes/restaurants can be a bit crowded at peak times. Good accessibility by train with own station (local cross-country and international services).,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,I Milono,Indonesia,Schiphol is among the best airport in Europe and it surely deserves it. It's huge modern busy and there are plenty of shops. However the plus side of this airport could also be the minus at times especially if you are in hurry catching a flight. It's huge and if you arrive less than 30 mins before your flight and you are new to this airport prepare some extra energy to sprint! I arrived in AMS at 6am on a cold November Saturday morning on my way to Oslo using a connecting flight. The bad thing was my flight from KUL was supposed to arrive at 5.25 am and the plane to Oslo was to leave at 6.50 am. Fortunately the immigration line (though crowded) was quite efficient. But for the rest I had to sprint all my way through Holland Boulevard a seemingly endless strip stretching in the middle of the airport to reach the gate where my plane waited. For passengers make sure you arrive at least 2 hours before your flight to enjoy all Schiphol has to offer.,7,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Martijn Wubbels,,Long rows very inefficient. I arrived at 5.35 at the check-in for Lufthansa and the queue was terrible long. My flight left at 07.05. Turned out they had just 2 kiosks open for around 4 different Lufthansa Flights. Finally they decided to open more check-in kiosks and the queue disappeared rapidly. It was already 06.20 when I could check-in. The lady was nice and when I told her I had a flight at 7.00 she advised me to tell it to the ground security as there were ridiculous long queues for the luggage check. I was directed to the premium users queue and although it took a while arrived at the gate at exactly 6.35. What is disappointing for me is that a great airport as Schiphol has this kind of problems. There must be something wrong there. It is a very nice airport but they really should invest in order to make check-in much smoother.,6,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,C Wajsberg,Israel,Large airport where everything but baggage delivery seems to be working very fine. Check in was flawless albeit I do have a platinum sky team card so no long lines. Passport control very friendly and professional duty free anything you can imagine but very expensive. KLM lounge is nice but not enough cleaning staff to keep the place clean of empty glasses and used dishes. Long walks to gates as there are many but everything is clearly marked so you do not get lost. All be it very well organized airport.,8,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Lalchhanhima Ralte,India,Flew in to Schiphol from Montreal by KLM on 20th Oct 2012. Read a lot of negative reviews but I must say it is a wonderful airport for transit. Yes it may not be as big as Changhi or Dubai but nevertheless not a bad place for a short transit. Love the free WiFi.,10,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,M Calame,Luxembourg,LUX-AMS-SIN - SIN-AMS-LUX - The airport is very functional and the area of Tax free shops and restaurants are numerous. It was clean and it was easy to find its way. What a pity I had a short time for the connection. On the whole I've really appreciated the infrastructures shops and signals. My bad experience concern the security check. The staff was quite unclear regarding the electronic appliances to show and I had to re-pass the check of my cabin luggage and without any pressure from ourselves we could still wait. I've nearly missed my connection due to security check. Anyway I hope to come back to Amsterdam for a connecting flight. Really good airport.,8,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,A Stephens,Spain,Insufficient time to catch connecting flights due to ridiculously long queues in passport control. Lack of special channel for European Union Residents existing in other airports. Flippant and inefficient attitude of passport controllers who appeared to be young and shallow. Numerous anxious passengers waiting in the queues who were ignored by the ground staff overlooking the queues. Security baggage checkers slow rude and careless with passenger's baggage literally throwing bags onto the floor to be rechecked. Many of them with a deficient level of English to facilitate the process. Surprising in Holland where most people have a good command of English! Enormous distance to reach connecting flight gate. I was heading to gate D87 at full speed when gate D56 was announced for my flight. I took no notice and a couple of minutes later they corrected themselves and said D87. Without doubt my last visit to this nightmare airport!,1,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,H Drubbel,Netherlands,Combined with internet check in and the KLM app for Android it works great. Luggage drop off is fast and easy waiting time at customs can take a while but in general it takes 5 minutes to pass. Enough to do to pass time like a museum many shops and even a casino. Facilities are clean staff is friendly and finding your way around is easy. Food and drinks are like any airport priced upscale.,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,D Macleod,United Kingdom,There are so many good things about this airport that make it my favourite to travel through on and off for the last thirty years almost. It may be big but it is never a real chore to walk from one point to another and in many trips through the airport I have perhaps fortunately not found myself seriously having to race from one flight to another. The shops the bars and restaurants are generally of a very high standard as are the lounges and staff are generally very pleasant. I have but one criticism and that is security for flights to the UK. On my outward journey last week security check for the leg to Helsinki was fair and thorough but just a common ordinary security check; on the return journey from Amsterdam to Aberdeen the security was oppressive and obtrusive. Some staff were thoroughly unpleasant process was slow and perhaps amusingly and reassuringly the captain was forced to go through the scanner three times before he was allowed to board the flight. Nevertheless I find it strange that flights to the UK should be so much more thoroughly checked than others. Are we a greater risk or at greater risk or is this just a reaction to our not being members of the common border agreement in the EU? For all that I would still say Schipol is my favourite airport of the majors in Europe. I have noticed this disparity of treatment several times in the last few years.,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Michael Sewell,Belgium,A very efficient if incredibly large airport. Lots of toilets shops cafes and plenty of opportunities to watch planes take-off and land. The cafes are a little over-priced which is a great shame. Yes you have to walk a lot here but if you allow extra time it's a pleasure to use.,10,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,S Norton,United Kingdom,On the whole I like Schiphol the signage to the BA check-in is non existent - I nearly always struggle to find them and I travel through several times a year. BA Lounge is small but tranquil the staff are always welcoming. It is a long walk from check-in and the walk to the gates is usually quite long as well. In some ways I prefer the gates that are the furthest as they have a mini 'central security' which means that premium passengers can have priority boarding. Most of the gates have individual security which means queuing up at the gate for security and again to board the plane. It seems an inefficient use of manpower. As I usually only stay in the Netherlands for a short time I avoid checking in baggage - the wait for bags to arrive is lengthy. The only other complaint is the taxi to the gate when arriving it can be in excess of 15 minutes. In summary not the worst used to be one of the best - but definitely needs more than a band-aid to put it in my favourites again.,7,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,D Kennerley,United Kingdom,Over the years used Schipol a lot but had a long break the past 10+ years. Facilities that a new since my last trip much appreciated - and used - Ryjksmuseum and library. Toilets were clean and fully stocked. Long distances as most people mention but with 5.5 hours hold over not a problem. Very poor boarding arrangements with long queue and slow process. Appreciate need for proper vigilance and doing a thorough job but something needs to be done to speed up the process - more checking devices/staff? Flight delayed all down to slow procedure. I was near to last in the queue and so far as I can tell no passengers were late. Could see staff beginning to panic as time went on. One issue I have is with Airport personnel zooming around on electric vehicles. They drive at breakneck speeds relative to the fact that the airport is always fairly congested with passengers.,7,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,David Tjan,Netherlands,I made more then twenty flights this year mostly from Schiphol. This September I departed from Schiphol four times. 3 times Schengen lounge and 1 time intercontinental. I have to say that Schiphol is becoming more and more outdated and is rapidly losing ground with major Asian competitors like HKG SIN and Seoul Incheon and Munich and Madrid in Europe. It's overcrowded congested not passenger friendly and the terminal buildings are getting old and claustrophobic. During peak times going through security on the Schengen side is like standing in line in Disney world with endless waiting cues. One time it took me over 40 minutes to pass security. For the first time I noticed how dirty it became especially the dining area above the Schengen departure hall. All tables were full of dirty plates left behind for several hours without cleaning. Food choice was also very poor. The staff tends to be arrogant and non service minded. I am also surprised how uninviting the immigration area is. A small dark corner when entering the Netherlands. Baggage claim is terrible small long wait and sometimes I feel as If I'm on a marketplace with no space at all to move. Usual wait lasts more then 30 minutes for baggage to unload and counting. I wish I could be more positive but I do think Schiphol needs a major upgrading to maintain it position as a big player in Europe.,4,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,D Macleod,United Kingdom,I come through Schiphol probably four times a year for the last twenty years or so and still say it is my favourite airport. It is a sizeable airport and consequently we have to walk distances but I have never found a problem with signs or with time available. There can be long queues at passport control and at security at times but I have always found the staff friendly and welcoming. Yesterday incidentally transferring from a flight from the UK to a flight to Finland I was through passport check and security in less than five minutes; not always so I know but the staff have always made the transfer relatively easy as far as I am concerned. I also love the opportunity to use the excellent Dutch bars and the attractive shops; probably the only airport I use where I really take an interest in the retail opportunities.,10,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,P Dalloz,United Kingdom,Clean and good facilities but badly managed security. Cant take drinks (even duty free) in hand luggage. Long queues waiting in the tunnel to get off the plane. Officious security people and intrusive body scanners.,2,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Azlan Hashim,Malaysia,I arrived from Kuala Lumpur on transit for my flight to Helsinki on the 7th of September. For some reasons I had to collect my luggage and recheck-in at AMS. There were huge queue on both at the check-in and passport control area. A long walk at this airport is very common. Eventually it was almost an hour from the beginning of my check-in time to the departure gate. My suggestion to those are going to use AMS for their start or transit point have yourself present at least 2 hours at the airport before your departure time. On my departure back to Kuala Lumpur on the 14th of September I was surprised when there was almost no queue at the check-in counter. Especially the designated counter for web check-in service. The agent was friendly. As usual there was a long queue at the passport control and a long walk to the departure gate. In general the airport is clean. The food chains and toilets are plentiful. 2 or 3 hours of free wifi is a regular practise in most of the airports worldwide. I hope AMS would apply that in the future and I bet passengers will happy and appreciate it!,6,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,J Andrews,United Kingdom,Three hour transfer at Schipol. Lot's of seats food outlets and toilets all very clean. Long walk between gates but was OK as I had plenty of time. Lots of shops for those who like that kind of thing. Museum was a fun way of killing time. Security at gates was quick and efficient but many passengers ignorant of security at the gates and wandered up for their flights very late causing delays (read the boarding pass for goodness sake). All the airport staff I encountered very friendly and all spoke English.,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,A Sandhu,United States,DEL-AMS-IAD. We had a 6 hour layover on the return flight airport was good with easy to access facilities but a long walk to the gate lots of stores and shopping and many things to do to pass time such as taking a tour of the city which you can schedule at the airport.,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Alan Finch,United Kingdom,Usual efficient experience in Schipol large distances to walk but as travelling to Canada no need for Schengen. Only disappointment - can only access roof terrace from departure hall otherwise trouble free.,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,C Neville,United Kingdom,Very good airport friendly staff - who even have a sense of humour! Easy to get around excellent connections to UK and elsewhere good facilities and very nice Business lounge.,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Alastair Finch,United Kingdom,2 long layovers at Schipol recently can stretch ones legs walking the long distance from one end to the other. Facilities excellent only downside is one can only access the roof from the arrivals hall. However it remains one of my favourite airports.,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,A Van de Wiel,Netherlands,I always enjoy Schiphol airport. It is clean has good facilities and great shopping. There is even a library. The distances between gates are sometimes quite long but everything is easily reached. Luggage handling is excellent there is a fully automatic luggage drop off and a passport scanner so you do not have to stand in line anymore. Even at the busy holiday season these processes are quick and efficient.,10,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,J Cioboata,Romania,Great and efficient airport. Facilities at the airport are excellent I especially enjoyed the annex of the Rijksmuseum which had very interesting paintings on display. Numerous shops to browse and plenty of eateries. One thing I missed was a proper sit-down service like. Signage and layout is easy to navigate however distances can be long but on a positive note it at least allows for healthy exercise between flights. One thing I really appreciated was that the security check is done at the gate which makes it less stressful and prevents endless queues as seen at airports with a central security check however reviewers seem to have a different opinion about it.,8,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Pat Theo,United Kingdom,We flew in and out of Amsterdam. I don't mind walking a bit but this is a large airport and it was a bit much especially if you are short of time. Full body pat down I moaned to the woman doing it and she was sympathetic and said how much she hated Amsterdam it was too busy and dirty for her! As for transferring nothing would induce me to go via this airport to anywhere even if it is the cheap option! The loos we used weren't very clean and needed maintenance. Food options looked good but we didn't have time to get more than a sandwich. We have friends arriving there today (and coming on to the UK) en route from Detroit I just hope they don't have much hassle their flight was already put back 5 hours so will have missed their connecting flight and we will have more hours to wait and a full body pat down might be the last straw! I suppose being able to look at some exhibits from the Riksmuseum whilst they are waiting might compensate a little.,4,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,G Cramer,Netherlands,I frequently use Schiphol Airport. The terminal is clearly labelled. The facilities are clean the stores are interesting. Food service is varied and also good. Parking and transportation is very well organized. It's an excellent airport except for one big thing: passport control. It is completely unacceptable to routinely wait between 30 minutes and an hour just to show your passport (mind you this does not include going through scanners and such it's merely showing your passport). The lines are typically enormous hundreds of people squashed into one area. Usually there are several booths unoccupied even though the lines are enormous. Despite all it's many great qualities Schiphol needs to serve people better at passport control. Below it asks me if I would recommend the airport. Of course what other choice does one have in The Netherlands.,5,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Farouk Mogheth,Thailand,"Flew through AMS on my flight from Prague to Cairo and return. The Airport is easy to navigate through loads of venues to eat and relax in the walking distances can get a tad too long if you connect from the EU to non EU terminals. Self transfer counters are great still with some nice staff assisting. SKY Priority works well in all parts of the airport. Unfortunately the self-passport control gates were not working so the lines were long even in the EU zone passport holders. Each passport and ID were closely controlled by the officers under magnifying glasses. The remainder is a breeze a very nice airport to fly through no complains at all except the ""charged"" internet.",8,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,N de Goffau,Netherlands,I fly often through this airport and for me I consider this as one of the most convenient airports. Plenty of facilities are available and the intelligent lay-out provides the advantage that no bus transport between terminals is needed what is unique for an airport of this size. Also every plane has its own gate what allows you direct walking access to the terminals. Handling of luggage is usually quickly finished and the transition below the airport makes that you can be very quick in Amsterdam. In summer times queuing might take a while but on average I have seen it much worse. Prices for food are relatively high. About transfers I cannot judge.,8,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,J Ludewig,Germany,I find this airport well organized for transferring flights. Less hassle than CDG for sure. Calculate some walking time but overall it works pretty good using AMS to change flights. I have been doing this quite a few times and it always was no problem.,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Brian Hunter,Canada,"I traveled through Schiphol Airport twice in June 2012. Since I was there in 2009 they have made Schiphol the most invasive airport from a security imaginable. Not only is a full body scan required but now all passengers (except children) are then subjected to a manual pat down. Are these multi-million Euro full scan machines less effective than the previous scanners requiring an additional fondling of passengers? I noticed that that the children are not placed in full body scanners but rather are walked though the old type scanner and after that are not subject to pat down. No doubt the scanner manufacturers have made billions of Euros selling machines that apparently have made the process more invasive and less effective. I will avoid this airport in future as this ""new"" technology makes the already ridiculous airport security process completely unacceptable.",3,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,P Merriett,United States,The airport is too large if you are transferring flights and are on a short time line. The restrooms are unkempt dirty and smell horrible. The security is inept and ridiculous they made me damage my own clothing in order to move through the security check point. The staff in the airport seem highly offended if you are just transferring planes in their country instead of staying. My family and I will be avoiding this airport from here on out. Highly unprofessional rude and unacceptable.,1,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,L Dilling,Mexico,Transit in AMS. Non-Schengen to Schengen return. Arrival time was 3pm and we found the Airport surprisingly empty. I am an EU-Passport holder my Partner is Mexican and I had no issues passing with her through the much shorter EU Passport holder line at immigration. Security check took 15 minutes. Distances at AMS are quite long we had 2 hours for transit which gave some time to stroll around the shopping mile. From all airports we visited on this trip AMS has the best Duty Free offers. On the return to Mexico we arrived in AMS in the Morning around 11 and the Airport was packed. Lines were long at immigration but we could again use the EU Passport line which reduced waiting to 15 minutes. Security check done at the gate which saved time. Staff friendly and efficient. Big Airport long distances AMS is stress free if your transit is 1 hour or less it might get stressful at peak hours.,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,L Scott,United Kingdom,I have transferred through Schiphol numerous times easily and this time was no different. The simple gate numbering system and one terminal concept meant I could rush though with ease and still go to the duty free shop with only a very short transfer time and Information staff are very helpful. Because of this when I book flights I only ever transfer through Schiphol (with KLM) and avoid going through Paris CDG (with Air France) at all costs.,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,D Marshall,United Kingdom,Used for flight transfer both ways. Toilets overflowing in both cases. System confusing. Worst of all was the security staff at gate D6 - very unprofessional and blunt to the point of rudeness. Very much a cattle market. I sympathise with some airlines who try to provide a good service but are let down by airport service providers in terms of the overall flying experience for customers. The airlines have enough collective influence to get things changed why don't they?,2,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Brian E Smith,Japan,A completely functional airport but not as good as expected. It seems very institutional with lots of stainless steel and many areas were crowded (check-in and at the gates). I found it difficult to transfer between a domestic European flight and an intercontinental one as the terminals were at opposite ends. Toilets are clean! Good food and shopping opportunities. Getting into the city is easy if you're going to Amsterdam. The security is fierce! The first time I've experienced a full body pat down.,7,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,J Glazebrook,Canada,We will never travel through Schipol again. We had a long layover and could find nowhere to relax let alone snooze. Gates have fewer than half the number of seats needed for a flight and passengers line up like cattle in metal railing-defined queues. Security scanning is done at the gate. Process of checking in poorly handled by grouchy staff. The bathroom I was able to find near our gate was not very clean or private.,2,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Bryan Clark,United Kingdom,First time in Schiphol for 20 years and it is the easiest and user friendly of major airports. KLM ground staff and immigration made our transfer a pleasure despite time being against us.,10,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Jens Jensen,Denmark,Were very close on time arrived 10 minutes before check-in closed but still able to check-in just before check-in closed. Shuttle busses all the time which take around 10 minutes to Terminal 3. Passport control very easy and just after check-in. You can avoid the shops and walk straight to gates. Very easy to find with wide walkways and loads of rolling bands. Security check into waiting room was not so pleasant 5 minutes waiting time but the security guys were rude. On the way home passport control was very smooth but there was a long wait for our baggage.,7,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,P Vandenbroeck,Belgium,Antwerp-Bangkok via Amsterdam with KLM. Arriving at the airport was a mess airport staff very rude and unhelpful. We had to queue for 2 hours at check-in. We were then brought to another check in were they told us we had 5 minutes to get to the gate. We ran to the gate and just made it (last passengers to board). To top it all off the plane didn't move for another 45 minutes! Horrible experience will avoid using Schiphol.,1,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,J Poultney,United Kingdom,If you have a short transit time please avoid this airport. It is very large and there is a lot of walking to do between gates. The worst are the KLM staff who can be extremely unfriendly rude and dismissive when you need their help. Never fly into this airport when there is any delay in Amsterdam due to bad weather or any other unforeseen circumstances because staff can't cope. You will be left stranded for hours or days and they won't bother to help you find hotel accommodation.,1,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Angelo Tzarevski,South Africa,JNB-AMS-ORD return. Transferred at Schiphol both ways. This is a very clean and well organised airport. Gates are easy to find with maps and signs everywhere which are easy to understand and follow. There are a number of rest areas with very comfortable seating (especially the ones on the top floor of Terminal 3). They are very quiet and comfortable. The airport also offers shower facilities although I am not sure if there are any free ones. I used the facilities at the Mercure Hotel in the transit area which cost 15 euros but if you are transferring between two long flights the price is worth it. Staff are friendly and helpful. There are decent duty free shops albeit not many. Schiphol is an absolute pleasure to transfer through.,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,S Triantafyllou,United States,Overall the best airport when it comes to duty free smoking lounges cafes etc. The worst when it comes to immigration staff - expect a 40 min-1 hr wait if travelling outside Europe. Recommended if your layover is long!,6,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,J Bergers,Netherlands,Overall it looks clean. The duty free shops are overpriced. Their system can be confusing mixing up arrival and departures. The biggest problem however is the security staff and police. Not friendly and at times arrogant or short tempered. Security is not well organized. In a short transit I would skip this airport. Travelling in Europe there are better options. Due to the very unfriendly atmosphere I would rate this airport poor.,1,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,J Martin,United Kingdom,In every other airport we have been in the departure lounge comes after the security checks on people and hand luggage. Therefore at Schiphol we threw away our water and left-over drinks before proceeding into the departure lounge thinking the next step would be the X-ray machines. However the main security checks in this airport are just as you are called to the gate before getting on the plane. Wish we had known. We didn't have a delay but if you do it's nice to know that you are able to keep your own drinks until just before getting on the plane. This does save paying extortionate prices in the departure lounge. Why don't more airports do this? We can recommend Schiphol airport.,9,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,A Lepik,Estonia,Clean and spacious (during the odd hours) toilet facilities are good. Signage is quite good sometimes a bit confusing. Immigration is fairly speedy but can be rude and arrogant depending on the officer. Airport staff is dismissive and has a definite attitude problem. Drink and food prices are extortionate many vending machines are not working. Too few resting areas for the amount of passengers during peak hours there are no places to sit. Getting around can be difficult as the trolleys cannot be taken to lower floors freely.,2,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Martin Walker,United Kingdom,What a great airport. Staff are helpful and kind it's clean the signage is perfect. Transportation into and out of the airport by train is very easy. They have even got smokers lounges. Recognising reality is a lost trait these days. Clearly Schipol has it's thinking head on. All airports should be like this.,10,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Yevheniy Kahanovych,Ukraine,My last experience at AMS was 40 minute transit. Having had boarding pass issued at departure point for the whole connection with no AMS gate number I was trying to find gate number on monitors at the arrival gate - but no monitors! Luckily there was a pool of KLM self service machines where I printed new boarding pass that showed my gate number (the most remote D28). I went there to be searched at the gate and just made my connection. No issues with security staff (polite efficient and competent) no issues with KLM gate staff (nice and were able to track my baggage immediately). No issues with toilets (clean well kept) easy signage lots of KLM self service kiosks. But please put some more monitors at the arrival gate areas!,8,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,M Stav,United States,I have flown through Amsterdam more than 20 times. A big airport with a lot of walking to be done. Its clean and bathroom facilities are frequent. The central area is full of shops and bars generally overpriced as a beer will run you 6-8 euros. All in all okay however staff and security procedures could be considered intimidating. Most times you go through a security check twice you get questioned one on one about your baggage and your entire day. The only thing I cant understand is their policy with duty free. If you bring a sealed bottled in the duty free vacuum sealed bag with a receipt from another airport they will confiscate it. Originally I thought this was a one time thing but over the years I have lost 3-4 bottles in that airport. I have been to over 100 airports and this is the only airport where this is apparently policy. Besides the duty free stance the high prices and the over the top security procedures I can't complain.,5,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,P Slumders,Netherlands,The airport has a lot of facilities plenty of room a nice atmosphere and efficient layout. Sometimes you have the problem with a short transit to have to run from one side of the airport on the other side.,8,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Y Tabib,Singapore,Airport Plaza is great better shopping options expected post check-in. Checking in can be crazy with long queues expect to do everything yourself self service check-in and baggage drop. Need more baggage drop machines and courteous staff.,3,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Newt Paulson,United States,"I stopped in this airport for a couple of hours on my return from Italy to the USA since Amsterdam is a hub for Delta Airlines and for some reason I did not have a direct flight back to the states on my return. First we had to stand in a line for passport control to go from one terminal to another. If my flight were in the same terminal I would have just gotten on the plane but as it was not I had to go and have my passport stamped to enter a terminal - surely the workers realize the people going to the other side of the terminal are leaving Amsterdam and this was a waste of time. Then there was a huge line as they do security at the gate however the line was huge and there are not enough seats at the gate. I walked across the hall and sat for 30+ minutes until the line died down and then went through security. It seemed to me if you went through the line early not only would you be waiting in this huge line but then you would be in this ""holding area"" until you boarded the plane with no restroom. The screening is very advanced they scan a color copy of your passport and ask you questions and even have body scanner machines which I asked if I could bypass they agreed and were professional but still I prefer the Italian airports where there is much less rigmarole involved. Schiphol reminded me of a USA/TSA airport which I do not care for although they were mostly polite and efficient to me I think I would skip it next time.",5,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,C Liu,Taiwan,A supposedly major transit airport. The priority lane at custom for flights with short connection time helps nothing at all people still queue up and the office allowed people with a small window of time before takeoff to jump the queue. Our boarding gate had even closed with no last call announcement. The high speed footpath was not operating we all had to run from one end of the pier to another. The flight reconnection kiosk supposedly to allow better access for passengers who miss the flight and reduce the staff workload. Yet the system simply couldn't find our entry. People still have to approach the transfer counter and the number of KLM staff were so few while people anxiously waiting to be helped were so many. It was another long queuing process. With all of the above do we still have the time and mood to enjoy the facilities this airport can offer?,1,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,A Crawford,United States,OSL to MSP through AMS on Delta. The extra security check at the gate for the AMS to MSP flight was expected what was not expected was being physically hit by the Dutch equivalent of TSA. The trays for laptops passing through the metal detector are sized to handle pocket change. I was worried that my laptop would fall from the tray. I walked through the whole body scanner all the while pre-occupied with what was happening with my laptop. After exiting the body scanner I walked over to the metal detector to retrieve my laptop. Next thing I know this TSA guy is hitting me on the back and yelling 'I'm not finished with you'. I was completely surprised and taken aback. There were no signs or people waiting just after exiting the body scanner saying I should stay put. I told the TSA guy that I didn't know I had done anything wrong and he yelled again that he wasn't finished. For those Americans who constantly complain about USA TSA try flying through AMS. Unlike other reviewers I did find AMS to be a clean airport especially given it's size. As for walking times it's a large airport so what do you expect.,1,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,L Thomas,United Kingdom,Having travelled several times to Schiphol Airport twice with a young child I can say that the only complaint I would have is that we were delayed while waiting to board the plane we waited down the steps and with a pram and a small child had I not have been travelling with my mother it would have been extremely difficult to manage both. Lovely clean airport with numerous facilities.,4,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Jim Elder,United Kingdom,I transferred at Schipol and I had to go through 3 full security checks with large queues at 2 of these. Very poorly organised facilities only good thing was security staff were less unpleasant than usual. Airport is great for shoppers I guess but I would avoid it if at all possible.,2,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,J Gómez,Spain,It seems a good airport but to make a transfer there could be a nightmare. I don't know if KLM is responsible for choosing the gates but if you by a ticket with a short connection is normal that from one gate to the other you have to run 2 km. Security control is awful but I have to say staff were very friendly.,2,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Alastair Finch,United Kingdom,Have changed here many times. Though it is very busy and walking distances can be lengthy the degree of organization is good though the schengen passport queue is tiresome. Facilities are good and clean. I do miss being able to go on the roof terrace however. A second security check while transiting is tiresome but a sign of the time however a single terminal albeit very large is great and my family love the shops.,4,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,A Smith,Australia,Arrived at Schiphol 4 days ago for a 2 month holiday in The Netherlands. One passport check as I left the plane and easily found my way to the luggage area then to the customs gate with virtually no waiting time. Only showed my passport to the official and was asked reason duration and location of my stay in perfect English. Only moments later I was at the exit of the airport wondering how it'd been so easy after the nightmare 4 hour stop at Guangzhou airport.,5,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,D Hartono,Indonesia,Its a good and spacious airport it also has a large variety of shops & restaurants. The airport itself is very clean and the washroom is also very clean and there is almost no queuing at immigration.,4,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Azlan Hashim,Malaysia,I was on transit to BUD. KLM transfer desk staff efficient and helpful. The airport receives so many international arrivals in the early morning. To my surprise the immigration counters were understaffed. I was travelling alone and travelling light. However I was in the queue for about 45 minutes. Pity to those families travelling with small children. Obviously queuing after coming from a long haul flight is not a pleasant experience for them.,3,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,T Bos,Netherlands,Airport is too big. The walking distances could be very long and it will take some time. In general the people working on the airport are friendly but not very helpful. The security people seems not really motivated.,2,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Jerome Vanderberg,United States,"My wife and I flew KLM from Schiphol to JFK last week - the worst and most offensive security arrangement we have seen. The security check is done by a team at each of the gates prior to boarding. When the start of the security check was announced we stood in a long line and had no opportunity to prepare ourselves by emptying pockets removing jackets taking out computers etc. People standing in line finally came to the single checkpoint where a woman barked out orders like a drill sergeant to move on through quickly. The people operating the full body scanner were competent and professional. Once we had passed through security we assumed that boarding the airplane was to begin shortly. Instead we were kept for 2 hours. in an overcrowded holding pen that seemed to have been designed for cattle. The holding pen had no toilets and a single machine for selling water. I lost 3 euros in it without a bottle coming out and when I asked the KLM agent nearby she replied brusquely (without looking up) that the airline had nothing to do with the machine. A short time later I saw a Dutch gentleman go through the same procedure. I walked over to the counter where he spoke to the same KLM employee. He said that he had lost his money in the machine and asked if he could exchange a 5 euro bill for coins so that he could try again. The agent dismissed him saying ""I am not a bank!"". He was told a place in the airport where he could report the problem but came back later saying that they could not help him there. I elected not to go with him because I was informed that I would have to go through the entire security routine again and that we would be getting water on the airplane. Later on in the airplane the captain apologized for the long delay explaining that it was due to the fact that the airplane had arrived late from its previous flight. Obviously the security people knew this so it was puzzling why they rushed us through so quickly knowing that we would have to stand in the holding pen for hours before being able to board the airplane.",1,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,R van Beuningen,Spain,Its signs are easy to follow many shops and bars/eating places a train station in the arrivals hall many connections and no annoying loss of time because for commuting between terminals.

amsterdam-schiphol-airport,M Jonkman,Netherlands,As a Dutchman I'm no longer proud on this airport. It has grown too big. It took us 2 hours from entering the airport terminal until arriving at the designated gate. Because we were flying inside the Schengen area luckily we didn't have to pass passport control.,3,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,C O'Neill,United Kingdom,On entering through the main door you are actually in the bus/train station. It takes a little searching then to find out where to go as most signage here is given over to trains and buses - through here signs are easy to follow. The only thing is the sheer distance to walk but there are moving walkways. Check in and security a breeze (they have the new scanners that 'see through' your clothes) with a good array of food and shopping outlets. Arrived at and flew from the 'economy pier' H the departure lounge of which was a box really a bit too warm with only a dozen or so seats!,5,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,C Bekkelund,Norway,Schiphol is probably the worst organized airport I've been to. First impression was when we arrived from Gardermoen/Oslo airport to Amsterdam. The people waiting for the plane back to Oslo from Amsterdam was partly sitting partly lying on the floors in what seemed like a never ending tunnel from the gate to the main area. There were a couple of seats every third mile or so. When we were leaving Amsterdam and Schiphol the airport left an even worse impression as we first had to stand in line forever for security check. There were two lines/security check points to the M-gates so a long queue must be quite normal here. What are they thinking? When we finally managed to go through security check we wanted to buy the necessities from the tax- free shop (we live in Norway prices are much higher than in tax free so this is something we need to take advantage of) then find a restaurant to get some dinner. At the lounge area we were very disappointed. The tax-free shop was about the size of a large kiosk and the only place to get some food was actually a kiosk with sandwiches and a tiny desk that sold coffee and cakes of some sort. We did not quite believe it at first since Schiphol is one of the worlds biggest airports but it was actually true. After finding a couple of sandwiches it was not that easy to find somewhere to sit. The people behind Schiphol apparently think that people like to stand straight up for two hours. Well.. Amsterdam was great but the airport not so great. Bring a chair your own food and try not to come to early to the airport since it's actually nothing to do not even shopping. Which means you do not have to bring money since Schiphol apparently doesn't want your money.,1,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,R Eveleens,Netherlands,Did quite a few flights with Easyjet I had to depart from either the M (schengen) or H (non- schengen) gates. After 5 flights not once did I have to wait longer for security then 3 minutes. The H-gates offer only a small overpriced place where you can buy drinks before boarding as do the vending machines at the gate area The M-gates offer a small lounge with possibility to buy a few items but don't go in there too early since there is not much to do you better of in Schiphol plaza. H or M gates use preboarding which means you are put into a holding pen but as they only open the gate when the flight is due to arrive you not have to spend ages. Trainstation is below Schiphol it offers easy connections to Amsterdam or other cities.,4,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,J Steele,United Kingdom,Transit via Amsterdam on return to LHR from GRU. Someone told me Schiphol was a great airport and especially easy to navigate. Well that aspect might be true but everything else was awful. The worst thing is there's just nowhere to sit - there are about 20 seats by each gate (hardly close to being enough!) and we couldn't find any anywhere else. I guess they want you to have no option but to wander round the many shops (the same repeated over and over) and spend your money! Starbucks was packed with people who'd finished their coffee and stayed in their seats because there was nowhere else to go. Then 'boarding' started - except they re-screen all your hand baggage before you can go through and with only one person and one x-ray machine it was absolute chaos! They did apologise for how long it took but we couldn't see how with that system it could ever take any less time! Be warned - take a cushion and be prepared to be late!,1,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,G Bezuidenhout,South Africa,I had the misfortune to travel through Schipol on my way to Boston. When we landed we were stranded on the plane for over 4 hours because we could not get to a gate apparently due to the snow. Once inside the filthy airport our connecting flight to Boston was cancelled but only after we had gone through security and forced to wait in the disgusting holding pen with no flushing toilets for hours. From the holding pen we were told we needed to rebook our tickets and that there were no vouchers available for food or hotels. At this stage nearly all the flights in the airport had been cancelled and there was queue literally a mile long waiting for rebookings. I waited in this queue for over 12 hours I slept in the queue I even met new people in the queue. There were contradicting stories being given by ground staff. There were no blankets or beds provided. The floor was filthy. It was the worst experience I have ever had. The worst part of my story is that when we finally got to the front of the queue the next morning we were told we could use our boarding pass from the previous day and just go to the gate. They made us stand in the queue for 12 hours for nothing! I will never set my foot in Schipol ever again.,1,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,David Gordon,Denmark,Two recent experiences connecting at AMS for onward flights to the UK (LHR MAN). Totally inadequate staffing of the security check at the gate both times - only one lane open security therefore so slow that flight departures delayed by ~30 minutes. This is unacceptable and KLM should press Schiphol to make gate security in the non-Schengen area much quicker.,4,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Justin Bell,Spain,I have been through Amsterdam many times and know the airport well. My main comments today (2010) is that it is a fairly easy airport to use great shopping lots of airline lounges if you have time between connections and are a privileged member of a frequent flyer programme plenty of toilets / rest rooms some left luggage safes restaurants internet access etc. It has the advantage of not being as big as London Heathrow or some of the large USA airports (JFK or Chicago) and having lots of flights all over the place. I have used the Yotel (airport hotel where rooms are booked by the hour) and it is useful if you arrive late at night and leave the next morning. The airport has 2 main sections - international (Gates D - H) and EU (Gates B -D). Note that some of the D gates are in the international section and some in the EU section. The biggest problem with Amsterdam airport is if you are connecting between a EU flight and an international flight you might have quite a walk and will most likely (unless you are very lucky) have to wait in a ridiculous immigration queue to get from one section to the other. There is a separate queue behind each immigration officers desk so if you get stuck behind someone who is being questioned you could have quite a wait. They also never have enough immigration officers for the amount of passengers passing through here and so they have now started a first / business class separate queue. Basically this bit is a mess. Someone else's comment about security at the gates meaning you can't buy water after security is a good point. Just take an empty bottle and fill it on the plane. Also if you buy any liquids in any other airport make sure they seal it in a an approved EU plastic bag seal otherwise you will leave it behind in Amsterdam! Overall it is an easy airport to use. Pity about the immigration mess!,4,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Joris Lammers,Netherlands,I have used Schiphol many times before and when eventually behind customs it is a very pleasant and vibrant airport. The train connections to Amsterdam and the rest of Holland are superb and cheap. There are plenty of shops and it is easy to find directions. Be aware though that there might be queing at check-in and customs so arrive on time. Schiphol really gives you a travel experience and I always enjoy staring my holiday or business trip from this airport. If you depart from Schiphol (not connecting) you must visit the panorama deck. Best in the world. Easy to access from Terminal 1 and 2 check in desks.,4,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,W Simpson,Thailand,Recently transited through Schipol from Edinburgh to Bangkok on KLM. The system is shambolic! The railed off lanes are supposed to allow Business Class passengers priority to go through security and to wait for boarding the onward flight. There are no KLM staff available and the airport staff misdirected me to the Economy queue. Once through security you are made to wait in an inadequately fitted cattle pen with insufficient seats and then a scum to get on board. Blame should go to both Schipol airport and to KLM neither of which seems to have any control over how this is managed.,1,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Peter Goldsbury,Japan,I have used Schiphol many times over the past 30 years but as I grow older the advantages diminish. The one-terminal concept is a major selling point for this airport but the airport is too large for this concept to be viable. The last time I used Schiphol the planes landed on and took off from the Polderbarn runway and this added about 20 -30 minutes to the overall journey time. Both the incoming and return flights involved a lengthy trek to Gate E. Baggage handling was fine on this occasion but is not reliable. Since I live in Japan and use Osaka Kansai as my main airport perhaps I am biased.,3,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Therese Doerum,Norway,"I've travelled to and from Schipol a lot of times the last 2-3 years and my first impression was that it was well organized informative friendly staff and alot of things to do while waiting for a train. Now after being there a little bit too much there is a couple of things I don't like. Cleanliness in the dining areas (at least downstairs). Rats running around and when I asked for the money back for the food I had ordered the waitress just said with an unpleasant voice ""its an epedemi just eat your food"". Try to avoid food that is not sealed in plastic and made somewhere else.",4,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Max Meijer,Netherlands,Why is Schiphol proud of it's one-terminal-concept? It may take up to a 40 minutes walk from one gate to catch a connecting flight and last week after landing taxi-ing and docking the plane took about 30 minutes - 50% of the flying time of my flight from ZRH. The whole enterprise feels like it has grown to an unmanageable scale for those who do the job on the ground. The core business should be efficient flight and passenger handling not operating a shopping mall.,2,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Robert Mansfield,United Kingdom,I have used AMS on numerous occasions and cannot fault it. Plenty of shops bars and cafes and well sign posted. The walk to and from D/H piers can be a bit of a pain.,4,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Jim Keeney,United Kingdom,On the whole quite a pleasant experience. Schipol Airport is large and spread out but sign posting is good. Ample shops and eating places and the airport seemed to be run quite efficiently. Security staff whilst very professional were a little over-zelous. I had to place my passport on a tray to be scanned. I was a bit puzzled at this. I see a previous correspondent has also commented on this.,4,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Riccardo Lehmann,Singapore,First time I flew from HKG to AMS with CX - arrival in AMS ok after night flight long taxi to the gate. AMS has a few construction projects it seems. Very long immigration queue due to only 3 checkpoints for non-EU passports and one EU passports counter open in a dark unwelcoming area. The few open counters are not enough at all when the flights from SQ Delta and CX are arriving at the same time (and many others)! I was through quickly as have EU passport but my friend had to wait nearly 30 minutes. Baggage delivered quickly. I love the great connectivity of AMS to trains bus taxi etc. On our return flight check-in very quick and no problem but again very very long queue for passport control there were two queues only for non EU passengers and one for EU passengers - my friend was waiting 45 minutes myself 30 minutes! There were 7 counters not open and it was busy lunchtime! This is a nightmare. Airport facilities ok but nothing special compared to HKG and SIN - I even prefer FRA!,3,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,S Potts,Netherlands,When travelling to Schengen countries Schiphol is a pretty good airport. There are plenty of facilities although shops are a little pricey. If you're flying to a country where you're required to go through passport control (gates E and above) then things get a little silly. The security check is at the gate which results in very slow boarding times and long queues. It also gives you no opportunity to buy drinking water before you board which is ridiculous before a long-haul flight. There was a vending machine but this was for Coke only.,4,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,N Baker,United Kingdom,Found this airport very good with the train station below and the various shops. When I arrived the walk from the gate to arrivals was long with Schipol being a large airport. On return I experienced the same problem with a previous reviewer where the departure gate number appeared less than 40 minutes before departure and then when it did we were panicking we would miss the flight as the gate closes 30 minutes before departure. All in all though I found the airport convenient with transport links and it's selection of shops.,5,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,A Galanis,United States,You can enjoy shopping eating and having a nice cup of coffee on the Terraza overlooking the various airlines arrival and departing the gates from outside. Easy access taking a train to the city from the airport and the Sheraton hotel is fantastic to stay in overnight before you board connecting flight the next day.,5,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,M Wilkins,United Kingdom,I like Amsterdam as a transit hub - however on my most recent visit it was not as good as previously. True there are long distances between gates so for very tight transfers its not ideal - if you have time to spare though there's a lot of things to do compared to your average airport (loads of bars/restaurants the free art museum lots of recliner seats the casino). However the pricing in the restaurants/bars is now on the high side (4.6 euros for a pint of heineken 8 euros for an irish breakfast) and had the misfortune of encountering a very irate and rude cleaner on my return journey - they need to ensure all their staff are customer trained.,4,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Peter Harrison,United Kingdom,Used AMS to transfer from flights from MAN and to PTY return. I found the airport easy to negotiate and containing every facility a transferring passenger could need. I agree with previous comments regarding the loungers on the first floor - If you can get one they are a comfortable resting place. The airport is huge and as I found on my return although I made my connecting flight in plenty of time my bags did not!,4,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Kay Gebauer,Switzerland,AMS is not a Star Alliance Hub and you feel a bit discriminated there. There are no Quick Check-ins and only one person at the counter for one Swiss flight. Security check is more than 40 min in the morning and the fast lane is only for SEN not for FTL. So be there 2hr before departure even if you're FTL.,2,0
anchorage-airport,Frank W Mauz,United States,"Ted Stevens Anchorage Airport South (domestic) Terminal is a pleasure to navigate through. Modern, uncrowded, spacious, scenic with many wonderful Alaskan artifacts. Seems that almost everyone photographs the giant stuffed moose upon arrival. A nice variety of stores-even a McDonalds with a 50 cent ice cream cone. Comfortable and roomy observation deck. Short walk to be connected to People Mover (city bus), Alaska Railroad and rental cars (no need to ride shuttle bus). The most complete and careful security check I have experienced.",10,1
anchorage-airport,Daniel Re,United States,The (south) domestic terminal in Anchorage is world class and beautiful. This new terminal is very modern spotlessly clean provides amenities expected at an international airport and offers a view of the surrounding mountains that is breathless. The displays of local wildlife native culture and art is unsurpassed by most airports in the world. However the old north terminal (which is now connected to the south terminal by a concourse) is sad. Anchorage is one of the five most busy airports in the world for international (cargo) airlines but not for international passenger service. The few international airlines that do provide passenger service (mostly during the summer months) are forced to use the north terminal as U.S. customs is located there. All the comments seen on this site are about the north terminal made by international travelers and are undoubtedly true. Wish they all could have been processed through the magnificent south building.,10,1
anchorage-airport,Christopher Dore,United Kingdom,Be aware the International terminal has only one shop that sells duty free goods. The only alcohol sold is a restricted choice of whiskeys and they only sell a restricted selection of cigarettes.,5,0
anchorage-airport,M McManus,United Kingdom,Went to Anchorage in late 2011. Airport has some restaurants on the security side of the airport but not a good choice and the quality was not too good. The gift shops on the other hand are excellent especially if you are looking for Native American art. Be warned that quite a few souvenirs are like snow shakers with water which will be taken off you by security if you need to pass through them again. Information screens were useful. Plenty of seating and quite a view out of the terminal window.,6,0
anchorage-airport,Ellie Dale,United States,I live in Anchorage so fly through here fairly often. The North terminal is old and outdated with little seating old and dirty bathrooms and few options for dining. The baggage claim in the north terminal is rickety old and often slow. The lines are longer and check-in just isn't as efficient. The north terminal is also very dark. The new terminal is great though lots of food and beverage options nice bathroom facilities plenty of seating moving walkways shorter lines efficient baggage claim and overall better design. There's also a lot more light and a better view of the mountains. The experience really does depend on which terminal you get. It will be either really good or really bad.,3,0
anchorage-airport,Peter Gloor,Switzerland,The airport lacks a transit area. Passengers are forced to leave the aircraft and pass immigration control. Passenger handling seems unprofessional. Gate waiting room had TV screens with commercials blaring out unwanted TV entertainment but lacked an information screen and a PA system. Airport ground handling delayed flight in spite of sufficient ground time.,1,0
anchorage-airport,G Winters,,"I connected in ANC on a PDX-TPE trip and I agree with the previous review that the facilities and nice in the main terminal and shameful in the International one. I arrived via AS in the South Terminal and waited 30+ minutes for the shuttle bus to the North (International) terminal. Check-in at China Airlines was smooth and after I cleared security I began looking for the lounge and I was amazed at the pitiful facilities for an ""International"" terminal. There was no Business Class lounge no restuarant only a kiosk with expensive and silly souvenirs. I was reminded by the clerk who sold me a $4 soft drink that ""It's 1am..what do you expect?"" When I pointed out that the China Airline flight I was taking was the only true ""International"" flight at ANC she suggested I call someone who cared ! About 1:30am my 744 arrived from JFK and I was surprised that the thru Pax had to disembark and were herded in to a sterile waiting room with the rest of us going to TPE. Four days later I returned and once again experienced the inefficiency of this Airport: all Pax must deplane at ANC and clear Customs - even those going on to JFK. There were 3 stations open - for an entire 744 that was 80% full. Despite 2+ hours of connecting time I barely made my flight in the South terminal. As far as I can tell the International terminal serves no real purpose with 1 International flight that operates 3x weekly ANC would do well by moving everything to the South terminal and demolishing this relic of the cold war.",2,0
anchorage-airport,G Hillier,,Your experience at Anchorage International all depends on which terminal you arrive in. The Alaska Airlines terminal shared with Northwest and AA's seasonal flights is quite nice and renovated. There are decent bars and restaurants and many good shops. Then there is the North Terminal - used by Delta Continental US Air and Air Canada. This was the former International Terminal used before Russian airspace opened up and before the 747-400 and 777 came along and eliminated the need for a refueling stop on flights from JFK to Asia and Heathrow - Asia. It is indeed a relic of the Cold War - a dirty dated claustrophobic mess that needs to be razed. There are no facilities whatsoever. Avoid Terminal N if possible.,3,0
anchorage-airport,Robert Clark,,Easy check in with the kiosks set up - even near the parking garage! I'd suggest taking advantage of Alaska Airlines' online check in as you can get bonus FF miles for doing it that way. Bars were nice - no smoking anywhere but the airport is small enough that you can get outside easy. Security takes a very long time even with a short time. I'd recommend 3 hours for even domestic travel - especially if there is a foreigner in front of you.,,0
anchorage-airport,Steve Hedden,,The new Alaska Airlines concourse in outstanding. Lots of light from the wall of glass along one side not to mention the breathtaking mountain views. Lots of moving sidewalks and flight information screens. Not many food places yet but these will come. The other concourses are quite dismal.,,0
ankara-airport,Mehmet Arca,Turkey,I have used it many times. New Esenboga Airport is excellent. Comfortable clean helpful staff. Duty free is small but can find everything. During the evening times its very busy for domestic arrivals (nearly 40 flights land in 90 minutes). International arrivals are also fair enough! Great airport.,10,1
ankara-airport,D Turkalj,Croatia,Very nice airport however just a few international airlines operating. Domestic always full due to Istanbul flights. Very expensive food and expect to pay around 30 EUR to taxi from city centre to airport. Clean easy airport but simply getting old without being used.,5,0
ankara-airport,Guy Senior,,Flew out on 23 October. No queues and the place is clean and all but empty no doubt because there is less than one international flight an hour. CIP lounge is comfortable and has nice views but a limited range of food. Expect to pay at least £25 for a taxi into or out from the centre.,,0
ankara-airport,Frank Epple,,The new Ankara Esenboga airport terminal is now operational - still way outside of Ankara maybe one hour from the city centre! Attention for passengers who changed plane in Istanbul with luggage checked through your flight will show as national arrival but you will be taken to international arrival to pick up your luggage clear customs and exit!,,0
ankara-airport,O Iner,,Horrible drive from downtown to airport. There is a major construction in the route and new terminal. It could easily take hour and half. So give extra 30 minutes in case road is blocked. Current terminal is old dark and ugly.,,0
ankara-airport,Phil Read,,Ankara and Istanbul airports must be the most expensive in the world. Food is poor and expensive and beer is an absolute rip off. Expect to pay £5 or 7.5 Euro for a beer. Coffee which can only be described as dish water is £2.50 a cup. In Munich on the same day I payed 2 euro for a far better beer.,,0
ankara-airport,M Gunduz,,Ankara Esenboga Airport is a small airport and looks and feels tired. Terminal area is small and check in can be problematic when there are many flights. However TAV (company that built Istanbul Intl. Terminal) is building a new modern terminal which will probably enter into service before the end of 2006. I had to endure 8 hours there waiting for a delayed charter and the wait was extremely unpleasant. In summer the high season for air travel and three full planes delayed the departure hall was extremely crowded with very few seats available. The food was way overpriced with no coupons from the airline. For transport into the city I always use Havas buses which depart almost immediately and their seats are more comfortable than taxis also much cheaper. I have used it in May and June 2006 and the road to the airport is under maintenance detour is through dusty and bumpy stabilized dirtroads making the travel 1/2 hour longer and uncomfortable probably for the whole summer.,,0
ankara-airport,Lawrie Hall,,Domestic departures a bit cramped if there are lots of flights in a short period of time. THY check in very speedy and efficient. The real blight is the prices at the bars and restaurants which are simply scandalous. 15 lire for a grolsch (£6/$10) or 10.50 for the local EFES beer. Food prices similar. I thought all airports had stopped ripping people off at these kind of rates but not here. Is it because they have a high level of European business customers on expenses and locals bring their own refreshments? Anyway highly irritating.,,0
ankara-airport,Takaya Ikezawa,,This airport is quite unpleasant and kind of shabby looking for an airport of capital city. No place to kill time until boarding time except simple bar and restaurant which over-price everything. There is no boarding bridge and all passengers are conveyed by buses to aircrafts. Turkish airline's domestic flights delay often it could be because of Istanbul Ataturk airport's traffic control thought. It is quite far away from the city. If it is not the rush for you taking Havas (limousine bus) is the cheapest. 8.5 New Turkish Lira. Taxi will cost 45-55 from the airport to the city center. (usually 55 to Cankaya) From the city to the airport you may have a chance to negotiate with drivers for discounts if you speak Turkish language. From my experience 35 from Cankaya was the best.,,0
ankara-airport,J Yap,,Ankara Esenboga Airport is a surprisingly small airport considering the size of the city although a much larger terminal appears to be under construction next door to the current building. It is also lacking in amenities. That being said its small size makes it very easy to negotiate and I whisked through both arrival and departure formalities (although passengers on outbound flights have to pass through security twice - upon arrival at the airport and after check-in). The airport's only serious inconvenience is its location 25 miles outside of the city.,,0
antalya-airport,C Pearce,United Kingdom,Flew in to Antalya last week and it was easy enough on arrival although queues on visa check took about 20 minutes before going through to collect luggage. On departure however you are firstly required to go through a pre- security screening on arriving which includes putting you're belongings through for scanning. This was all over the place and the workers were very rude and unorganised. After this you queue again to show your passport and boarding pass before getting through this congested area to check in. Check in took over an hour with each queue having about 10-12 people/families in it. Staff did not have a clue. We went through the next passport check which was fine for us but if it was busy it could get very messy. Then onto security there was no trays left and when I got a tray from the next line someone tried to skip me. After this I think it was through to duty free where the shop staff are helpful enough on the floor but the till staff were rather rude. Finally it was boarding which seemed to take ages and when I got to the front my barcode wouldn't scan the machine had broken and the woman was very unwelcoming! Onto the flight and we where happy to have some friendly Scottish staff to greet us. Won't be back here and would not recommend to others.,,0
antalya-airport,Margaret Hedges,United Kingdom,We travelled back from this airport on 13 January 2015 and were very happy with everything. All staff that we encountered seemed very competent and all the queues were short and fast moving. I acknowledge it was winter and therefore there were not many flights leaving. There were plenty of seats vacant although again this may well be because it was winter and not busy. What impressed us most of all was how friendly everyone was. The departure gates are very close to everything else so no walking for miles. I have absolutely no complaints about the airport: in fact I think it deserves much praise. We did not buy anything at the airport because in my experience all airports are very expensive and therefore we avoid spending money in them. Whist I realise that the time of year we were travelling made a difference I can only say that our experience there was excellent. No complaints.,9,1
antalya-airport,A Dethier,United Kingdom,We arrived more than 3 hours before our flight but nearly missed it due to bad management. There was only around 10 persons in front of us to check in and drop their luggage but every family in front of us spent around 20-30 minutes each because of discussion around the baggage allowance. It was clear that they had more than allowed but each bag weight was discussed and argued with the staff for at the end agreeing to let them check in their bag after long discussion without paying for the extra weight. It was clearly mentioned that every extra kg would be 11 euros. We finally started complaining after having waited for 1 hours and a half then a third line opened and we managed to finally go to passport and security check and finally run to the gate to have our flight. This is not acceptable the staff was not efficient not respecting anyone who was not shouting at them. The rules were clear and should be respected. It doesn't need a long discussion or any argument.,,0
antalya-airport,Camilla Feiring,Finland,I just came home yesterday from Antalya I was so lucky to get to my flight in last minute because I spent 45 minutes in total panic waiting to show my passport along with hundreds of other passengers and no lines to stand in. Just pushing and fighting to get through to one of the two men checking your passport. All the time they let more people through to that area so you had to push harder not to let anyone pass you. It was horrible. Why was there no line-system like in every other country I've been to?,,0
antalya-airport,L Bradley,United Kingdom,This was one of the most distressing experiences I have had at an airport. I was travelling to Manchester from Antalya along with hundreds of other people. Some people were travelling to different countries such as Holland Russia Germany. There simply is no queuing system. Everybody chooses anywhere where they can have their luggage and passports and tickets scanned. It doesn't matter where you are travelling to or what time you just pick your own check in point. This may sound ideal but believe me it isn't. If your flight it due in an hours time from check in then you will be very lucky to get on your flight. After checking In you then are scanned. Then you have to have your passport checked again. Believe me this was so traumatic!!! All nationalities were pushing and squeezing to get their passports checked. There were thousands of people some who only had ten minutes to get on their plane before take off. There must have been only 3 or 4 people to check all these thousands of people's passports. Travellers were becoming irate distressed and someone with a weak heart could easily have collapsed. There needs to be a much better system. I will never use this airport until I hear the system has improved. Somebody could have been very seriously hurt or even worse. Children were crying people were shouting at each other and the workers checking the passports were extremely stressed out. Please just put queuing barriers up so people can follow an orderly queue and no one will miss their flight and boo swill get hurt.,,0
antalya-airport,N Fusto,Germany,Quick check in- Security and passport control very fast. But workers at the shops and duty free shop very unfriendly. Very expensive - water 3 euros Burger King menu more than 10 euros.,2,0
antalya-airport,John Wilson,United Kingdom,Arrival big queues for entry visas and passport control but these didn't last that long and we were through fairly quickly. Check-in was standard holiday had to queue for a short while but through security fairly quickly. Not far to all the departure gates from the departure lounge. Reasonable selection of shops and bars but if you can eat drink and do your shopping before you get to the airport as the prices are silly. So expensive for everything which really lets the airport down.,4,0
antalya-airport,David Gartside,United Kingdom,Domestic terminal. Used recently on flights from/to IST. My experience was very different from that noted by others. Calm efficient pleasant terminal in both directions. Screening to enter building and again after check-in is potentially a bit tedious but worked smoothly. Prices airside a bit steep but that's not just a peculiarity of ATL!,8,1
antalya-airport,N Whittle,United Kingdom,Awful Airport. Once your through passport control the prices literally sky rocket. Toilets very dirty floor covered in water. Oddly there is signs all around the airport saying it was awarded best in Europe don't understand how it got that.,2,0

antalya-airport,H Grimm,Germany,I hate the airport of Antalya on the return flight the experience spoiled the entire holiday! First incompetent counter staff which has no foreign language skills. Second the totally stupid security types which does not even work consistently. The beverage sellers in the duty free area continue to charge the most exorbitant prices. Announcements are also made with very poor foreign language skills.,1,0
antalya-airport,C White,United Kingdom,Just got back and the airport was very quick and efficient on arrival - queuing times were not bad at all - however the departure was a sorry of constant queues and the price of food was absurd... 44 Turkish lira for 2 Burger King meals. This wasn't even the advertised price as an additional service charge was added. People were complaining but suddenly nobody speaks very good English. It felt like a dodgy Market trader ripping you off once you'd already accepted you were being overcharged. Avoid the food halls and duty free - duty free prices are the same as at home but the bottle sizes are different to make it appear a better deal.,2,0
antalya-airport,L Frederic,Germany,Been there quite a number of times. Terminals are wide apart only Havas Bus runs to city and is overpriced. There is a local bus but no apparent stop and schedule. Usually huge lines at terminal entrance due to X-ray and check in counters due to holiday travellers. Celebi and Havas check in agents which handle almost every airline are usually not friendly. Airside area usually very crowded not much place to seat long lines at security not organized. All airport outlets terribly overpriced. Only good thing is that it's quite modern and clean. A typical airport for the holiday travellers which accept this kind of customer service.,2,0
antalya-airport,J Parkes,,"Glad other people found prices ridiculous. And as for the Customs officers and immigration police. No ""Welcome to Turkey"". Instead you are met by off-hand unwelcoming officials who give the impression they are doing you a favour!",1,0
antalya-airport,J Burrows,,"I remain totally baffled as to how the shopkeeper at the check in hall in terminal 1 is allowed the freedom to try and try being the operative word here and charge me 2.5 ytl for a newspaper the Turkish Daily News clearly marked 1.5 ytl and sold everywhere under the Turkish sun for 1.5ytl including as it happens Istanbul airport just twelve days before then tell me like some Bodrum con man that 1.5ytl is ""Bazzar price"" and 2.5 is airport price. He scanned it then over rode the price to slip in another lira for himself. Is there no-one in the airport looking out for this kind of thing. It can't be just me so this kind of thing is really really going to leave a bad taste in people's mouths as they head home more than enough to leave it as the most lasting impression of the beautiful city they've just visited.",1,0
antalya-airport,K Harragan,,Flew to Gatwick from Antalya last week. Being off season it was fairly quiet and so no queuing to get in. The place was reasonably clean and looked after but not sure how it would have coped when really busy. Can only agree about the extortionate price of food and drinks. What made it worse is that you weren't told when handing over large chunks of cash for a bottle of water that the security guards would take it from you when you tried to board the plane - you can't take drinks bought in the airport onto the plane unlike at UK airports. Wouldn't be surprised if the bottles went straight back on the shelves! Can't see why the authorities are happy to let you leave their country on such a sour note - they'll get more money from a happy customer making a return visit than they will ripping you off at the airport.,2,0
antalya-airport,Peter Haynes,,The security arrangements at Antalya airport seem a little strange. OK you are screened on the way in and again when you go upstairs to lounge and duty free area. BUT having bought a bottle of water in duty free you are then not allowed to take it on the 'plane because you cannot take more than 100mls beyond the final screening point leading to departures. At Gatwick you are able to take what you have bought in duty free onto the 'plane. Much more sensible I think. Queuing to check in to a flight is also a long winded process.,3,0
antalya-airport,Steve Bennett,,I regularly fly to and from Antalya airport (10 times+ per year). The arrival facilities are fine. Baggage arrives fast - even during busy periods. The stairwell from arrivals to baggage reclaim is steep - hold on to the rail tightly! Howeverdepartures is another story. I cannot fathom any justification for the outrageous prices charged by those with airport food and drinks franchises at this airport. It is the most expensive airport. I was charged 27 euros for 2 coffees and an inedible sub. This not only left a nasty taste in my mouth but in my wallet too. My advice - take a doggy bag. Do not buy from these airport licensed criminals. The authorities in Turkey should act to protect their own reputation which is compromised by encouraging these bandits.,1,0
antalya-airport,Horst Rotter,,We were also shocked to have to pay about 4 Euro for a miserable small cup of coffee inside terminal 1 served in a plastic cup. This was our last impression of Turkey and we wonder whether the Tourist Authorities should not do something about this image harming practise.,2,0
antalya-airport,Wolfgang Schuessel,,Airport in itself okay. However prices asked at the airport restaurants are a pure chuzpe. 8 Euros for a cup of coffee and a dry tiny something-like-croissant. If you are picked up from your hotel at 1:30am to catch a 6:50am flight you will be stranded at the airport for long enough to end up buying at these ridiculous prices. It seems they are counting on this. If you ever have to go through that airport make sure to bring a doggie bag! Don't support this greedy attitude.,,0
antalya-airport,Gary Whittaker,,Antalya airport is modern and clean the need to scan bags at the main doors is a pain especially in hot or bad weather as you wait outside the terminal otherwise it is like any other airport. But by far the biggest downer is the prices inside nothing short of extortion on a grand scale expect to pay 3 times the normal price for everything including the so called duty free goods.,,0
antalya-airport,Murat Nal,,We arrived at Antalya airport 5am over the Christmas period the airport was empty - the only flights coming in were from UK. Airport was nice We went threw customs in two ticks. The baggage followed and we were out in half an hour. Departing from Antalya was also very quick but I put this down to the fact we were travelling of season and of peak times. Airport was okayish. I was very disappointed by the food and beverage franchises. £3.50 for a cup of filter coffee. I dared not ask the price of a burger at Burger King.,,0
antalya-airport,Mark Evans,,As at other Turkish airports one must undergo security screening at the entrance to the terminal at AYT. In fact there are two terminals: the Domestic and International Terminals are separate buildings. For my flight to IST continuing to LHR I presented myself at the THY check-in in the Domestic Terminal but was told that if I wanted to check my luggage all the way to LHR I would have to go to the International Terminal some 500-600m away. To this inconvenience was added the simultaneous arrival of six tourist coaches which began to disgorge their passengers and hefty luggage. This prompted me to accelerate and get to the screening point ahead of the crowds - any dithering would have left me at the end of long lines that would snake out of the terminal as described in previous postings. A close call that. Check-in proved quick and friendly and a pleasant place to relax once within was the Zum Strammen Bar which clearly caters for AYT International's mainly German clientele.,,0
antalya-airport,George Edwards,,Antalya airport is the worst I have departed from in recent years. With huge queues and sweltering heat the government owned refreshment outlets were charging positively extortionate prices for bottles of water. The one good side was that despite all the threats and warnings about excess baggage charges by the holiday company the actual check in staff couldn't care less about the few extra kilos as they had several hundred passengers to deal with and knew it was silly anyway.,,0
antalya-airport,Matthias Moehring,,The airport seems completely overwhelmed by the growth in tourism to this part of Turkey. We in November 2003 had to wait outside the building for some time just to get in since even with all entry doors open the baggage scanning and x-raying stations could not cope with the influx of passengers. There were no queues rather a mass of people jostling to get inside as swiftly as circumstances would permit with the result that people were trying to block each other with bags carts etc. An ugly first impression. Once inside it was the familiar situation of many mostly charter airports: only two to three counters open to check in more than two hundred people for a flight. Result: more standing in queues. Finally it is necessary at this airport to have hand baggage x-rayed and another body scan when entering the gate holdroom. There is just one bag scanner and one body scan gate per holdroom - and the security staff decided to open these about 25 minutes before scheduled departure. Result: more standing in queues and a departure delay due completely to slow passenger processing of 35 minutes. All in all two hours of standing in various queues just to be processed do not leave the impression of an airport that works well. This is the first privatized terminal in Turkey a joint venture with Frankfurt Airport and their own publicity claims they have the goal of making the passenger experience as pleasant a possible. Well unless they liaise better with security forces and handling companies to loosen bottlenecks they will not achieve that goal.,,0
antalya-airport,John Hyland,,"Our first experience of the Airport was a large queue outside the actual terminal building waiting for baggage and body scanning. A very ""off hand"" official operating the scanner seemed determined to upset as many passengers as possible by his gruff and officious manner. The remaining impression that I have of the Airport is that it was dirty and and the products on sale were ludicrously overpriced. Compare a can of coke Manchester International Airport c £1 to Antalya £3+. On the positive side the internal architecture is excellent.",,0
antalya-airport,Berk Tan,,Antalya Airport's new terminal - it's a huge area full of duty free shops and restaurants. Although Antalya is mainly used for charters flights to Germany and other EU countries the old terminal was so small that it was impossible to take many passengers.,,0
antigua-vc-bird-airport,P Cullen,United Kingdom,I did not find Antigua as bad as some but it was not exactly trouble free. Immigration took about 40 minutes bad but I have suffered worse elsewhere and the officer was polite and welcoming. Departure is rather chaotic you queue to check-in (about 20 minutes in our case) and to go through emigration (over 30 minutes) though security was cleared quickly. Once in the terminal it was crowded but had (just) enough seating. The snack bar was reasonably priced but souvenirs can be found cheaper elsewhere on the island. The good news (hopefully) is that the new terminal building is complete and due to open in the next few weeks according to locals it is much larger than the present one and looks a better design - there are several dedicated piers for large aircraft. Antigua is a great island and I look forward to experiencing the new facilities.,5,1
antigua-vc-bird-airport,Stephen Whitlam,United Kingdom,Arrival procedures are simply horrible and are still (Feb 2014) no better than those described by other commentators. Although I did find the staff welcoming and helpful. It seems to me that the lack of infrastructure and unwieldy procedures cause the delays - I imagine the staff dread the days when the BA the Virgin and a couple of Nth American flights land almost at once. Thank goodness the rest of the island makes up for it! Never had a problem on departure though.,3,0
antigua-vc-bird-airport,John Parson,United States,I am at VC Bird airport as I write this. We had an 1.20pm flight to Newark arrived at 10.50am for the flight. There was one couple in line ahead of us to check-in so this took 5-6 minutes total. We walked to immigration where there was no line this took another 4-5 minutes with a very friendly immigration officer. No line at security and again staff were friendly and the equipment was working. The lounge is air- conditioned has free wifi food and shopping . The entire check-in/checkout took about 12 minutes at most.,10,1
antigua-vc-bird-airport,Andre Franca,Brazil,As many have said here ANU can be a nightmare if you have only one hour to transit you won't have enough time as immigration can easily take more than 1 hour. Antigua is a nice country but there's a huge lack of organization big lines and only a few x-ray machines working the duty free lounge divides the boarding area from the waiting area. Bottom line it took me 45 minutes to fly from Saint Kitts to Antigua and almost two hours to get out of this airport.,5,0
antigua-vc-bird-airport,D De-Dutton,United Kingdom,On our incoming flight we cleared customs and immigration in 40 minutes and very quickly picked up a taxi to our hotel. Next day we returned to the airport for our onward flight to Tortola and had to stump up 28 US$ each departure tax as we'd been on the island for just over 24 hours - by 30 mins. We went through security to the departure lounge which wasn't too crowded to await our onward Liat flight. The homeward fight wasn't too bad though there was a massive queue at security when we arrived as there were several flights before ours. We went through security (no problems) and sat for a couple of hours in the departure lounge where we found the PA announcements hard to hear. We found staff fairly good though in general rather impersonal - not one smile from those behind desks. Our outgoing BA flight was parked at the extreme end of the apron so we had to walk about a quarter of a mile to board. The airport is working at its limit of capacity but hopefully the new airport will be in action soon.,6,0
antigua-vc-bird-airport,P Murphy,United States,Avoid this airport especially on transfer flights. You have to go through a highly disorganized and lengthy security screening even though you are already cleared from another airport and arrive behind security screening. Half the equipment wasn't working we had to wait long lengths of time to get through and pushed back while other flights were given priority to go through what few security screening lines there were. We came close to missing our transfer flight each time we went through thanks to total confusion and disorganization. If you want your vacation ruined this is the best place to start. Pay even a higher fare if necessary to avoid this place.,3,0
antigua-vc-bird-airport,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,Arrived at Antigua Airport from London to an utter shambles. Due to the way international flights are scheduled the airport becomes overrun for a few hours each afternoon. It cannot cope with the number of passengers with half a dozen or more wide-bodied jets arriving from the UK and North America in the space of a few hours. We queued for 2 hours to get through customs and immigration and then waited again for a taxi to our hotel. The airport is run down and badly in need of some re-decoration at the very least and ideally some staff customer training.,2,0
antigua-vc-bird-airport,Charles Offdenson,United States,Antigua is a great country. It's airport however is the 7th ring of hell. Departing Antigua though you speak to 8 different people. Check in does not warn you of the departure tax (which is now 50$ USD - a previous review stated it used to be $25 and was to be eliminated - guess that didn't happen). Why the hell can't they get the airline to collect this for them - it's cash only as well. There are numerous checks lines etc before you get anywhere near the plane - and they were calling 'final boarding' before we even checked in? It took an hour and a half to get through the building. The flight was delayed 40 minutes since there were still more people behind us scrambling to get on the flight. They need to fire everyone that works there bulldoze and expand the place and lose the absolutely insane checkpoints/lines/security.,1,0
antigua-vc-bird-airport,Lee Ewert,Canada,We travelled on a Saturday and even though we were in row 2 on our flight there were two other flights ahead of us so we waited two hours just to get through Customs and Immigration. From what we could tell the delay is caused by a lack of signs instructing travellers about how to fill out the forms given to them by the flight attendants. That and a general lack of caring on the part of everyone working there! Believe me these people may want your tourism dollars but they don't want you. The trip back was even worse. There are no signs telling anyone which flight is boarding (all are through the same gate); the PA system is so bad that there is no way of actually understanding what is being announced; there is no Arrival/Departure information anywhere. We won't be returning because of the way tourists are treated at the airport: Antigua (or Antagonize as we have come to know it) obvously doesn't want any tourists to travel through their airport.,1,0
antigua-vc-bird-airport,Clive Drake,,I have been flying to Antigua for 16 years and the airport is the same now as it was in 1993. On arrival with BA just pray you dont see a Virgin 747-400 and a BMI jet on the tarmac. Immigration is truly beyond your worst nightmares up to 2 hours! On the return BA Club world passengers use a tatty lounge (landside) with the windows blocked out overlooking a large seating area that is always empty. You get a free drink that can take half an hour from a lone waiter. Snacks consists of a few cream crackers some cheese and celery with some strange dip. If the whole Club cabin decide to use the lounge; forget it! Security is to a high standard - but the staff the rudest on the planet. The plane is boarded by walking over the windy tarmac.,1,0
antigua-vc-bird-airport,L Hillson,,"Recently returned from Antigua. The airport is a disgrace but worse still are some of the staff employed. They do not know the meaning of 'customer relations' or how to work at any speed to get the queues moving. Entering the country was bad enough but on leaving I was stupid enough to ask a civil question as my hand luggage was going through the scanner to be shouted at more than once to ""shut up shut up get your sunglasses and bracelet off shut up"". What a total disgrace! I felt I could not complain there and then as one feels very vulnerable in those situations.",1,0
antigua-vc-bird-airport,J Brockhurst,,"A very basic ""bare bones"" airport. You check in at airline desk which is opposite the taxi rank. The only flight information you will see in the entire airport is at the check in desk. The cafeteria is before the security check and is up an external concrete staircase more commonly seen in a run down housing estate. The cafeteria seems to be reasonable enough but those unwise enough to fly BA Business Class are ushered into a room that BA have the effrontery to call a lounge. Its possibly the largest room (and I mean room) that BA could find. Its dimly lit ideal for those who choose to watch the football on the tv but not so convenient for those who choose to read. Furnished with darkwood furniture it has the appearance of a slightly worn 2* hotel from the fifties. The view through the window is into the seating area of the cafeteria nothing external. Drinks are brought by a a waiter from the bar outside and as for ""nibbles"" you help yourself to the few miserable offerings of cheese situated on a dresser. Virgin passengers have access to the ""Sticky Wicket"" over the road (this is a bar in the cricket club). Antigua is truly a wonderful country with people to match so don't judge the country by its airport.",1,0
antigua-vc-bird-airport,C Swan,,Arrived on BA flight from LGW. Very full flight for the cricket so had to queue to ages to clear through immigration. Not helped by the fact that 2 young ladies didn’t know where their accommodation was (why are they so fussy about this?) and one inebriated passenger had lost his passport. Porters were very pushy and hard to get rid of. Departed on 3 Nov - a nightmare. Flights were very full and so there were long queues to check in not helped by the fact there are no self service machines. None of the ATMs at the airport or the nearby Bank of Antigua were working so we ended up having to borrow money off other passengers to pay our departure tax. Not sure what this tax is for given the woeful state of the airport. Again long queues for immigration – perhaps they were wary of our NZ passports? Very few shops not enough seats café inadequate. Worst airport I have ever been to and a disappointing end to an otherwise fantastic trip.,1,0
antigua-vc-bird-airport,Nick Parker,,Arrived today at Antigua airport from Anguilla en route to Gatwick with Virgin Atlantic but scheduled 2 hour wait was reduced to 1 hour after delay to first flight. No assistance provided at airport to find luggage and airport staff were uncooperative and unfriendly. We were given the choice to board without luggage or miss the connection and wait for luggage despite their still being an hour to departure.,1,0
antigua-vc-bird-airport,Craig Covil,,I concur with Geoff Isaacs comment the best thing on departing is to get there early check in - lose the luggage and go for a cold beer (Carib) across the road at the Sticky Wicket good food too. This airport is very tired and when hot the terminal building lounge is very sweaty - not what you want just before you get on board a long haul flight. They should demolish this and get a new terminal building with lots of passive ventilation. Last time I departed the security scanning machine for hand luggage broke down so nothing got scanned. Lovely people. Lovely country.,2,0
antigua-vc-bird-airport,Geoff Isaacs,,First of all make sure you have the correct paperwork given you by the airline in flight despite flying BWIA all on our flight were 1 form short per persons including children. Once through the security check getting in the luggage came quite quickly on the antiquated carousel ignore the porters its only a short trip to the exit. On return get there as early as poss if you don't like queuing because every case is searched prior to check in we arrived slightly more than 3 hours early under our own transport this meant it only took 30 mins to check in then paid the $25 tax to leave (to be abolished soon). Rather than go in the departure lounge we headed across the road to the Stickey wicket cricket ground/bar/museum where we languished in luxury while watching a floodlit pro/am cricket match. we went back to the airport 1 hour before departure. the departure lounge has nice shops but I wouldn't have liked to have been sat there for more than an hour. Once called to gate (one gate with several airline desks!) we were pointed in the direction of the walkway and set off to board the plane from this point we never saw another airport official until at the top of the steps at the plane it was dark and non experience flyers could have easily boarded the First Choice aircraft by mistake. On the whole not a bad experience but improved by going to the Stickey wicket (believe Virgin passengers are given vouchers to spend there),,0
antwerp-deurne-airport,C Wajsberg,Israel,Very small airport with not many destinations to fly to from. Free parking in front of airport very fast check in. One restaurant coffee shop with nice local food. Arriving at Antwerp airport it will take you around 5 to 10 after disembarking until you receive your suitcase and are in a taxi home.,10,1
antwerp-deurne-airport,S Smith,,So refreshing to be able to use Duerne instead of Brussels. Less than 3 minutes from plane to car this week and that included collecting a bag. On return I checked in about 45 minutes before the flight hardly any queue.,5,0
antwerp-deurne-airport,S Smith,,Fantastic airport. I go in and out at least once a month. Yesterday I timed my arrival and from walking off the plane to being outside at a taxi was 43 seconds!!! 15 minute check in for departures.,5,0
antwerp-deurne-airport,Karel Hladky,,What an amazing little airport ! All flights depart from Gate 1 - there being only Gate 1. Nice little shop the restaurant is being rebuilt. Do not arrive too early for your flight as everything shuts in-between flights.,5,0
antwerp-deurne-airport,Mark St-Amour,,Free parking 15 minutes check-in a bar and a duty-free shop. Nothing wrong with this airport except not much to do if there's a delay.,4,0
antwerp-deurne-airport,H van der Maarel,,ANR-LCY vv. recently with VLM. Early morning flight on a Saturday back on a Monday evening. Antwerp is a small airport and due to the low number of passengers it functions efficiently and fast. My time from plane to car on the way back was about 10 minutes which includes waiting for my luggagee !,4,0
antwerp-deurne-airport,Michael Newport,,Great airport not many flights so no hassle. From check in to take off 15 minutes. Car parking also free !,,0
arkhangelsk-airport,Y Kiselev,Norway,Used this airport on numerous occasions over the last 20 years. Over the last year (2010) both domestic and international terminals underwent some renovation and rearrangement of facilities - in my opinion for the better. Of all facilities/services expectable from a mid-size regional airport ARH lacks free WI-FI coverage and cafes serving hot meals. Overall it is a decently well-kept airport which may though benefit from further renovations and improvements.,4,0
aruba-reina-beatrix-airport,Barry Vogel,United States,Arriving was a breeze Luggage came out quickly and there were no problems. Departing was a different story. It was terrible. There was a line for everything. Slow is a word that really describes departure. It took easily 3 hours of standing in line. Not only that we had to wait on the plane while stragglers came through customs. The plane was delayed 1 hour (par for the course of all planes to the USA) and we missed our final connection. We'll never go to Aruba again. Certainly not until the departure nonsense is changed for the better.,,0
aruba-reina-beatrix-airport,C Gal,United States,Arrived in Aruba 15 min early only to sit on plane an additional 45 min due to other plane at our gate. They would not give us another gate and finally pulled over some stairs and they sent us a shuttle to get to terminal. Going home-horrible! We were warned to allow 3 hours which we did. United Airlines had no kiosks to print boarding passes thus we had to wait in line w/everyone checking baggage. Security and Aruba customs are very slow-going only 2 people working. Thankfully we had carry-on baggage only so didn't have to deal w/luggage fiasco. Our departing plane was delayed by an hour but had it not been we would have just barely made it. Beautiful Island terrible airport with not enough people working.,1,0
aruba-reina-beatrix-airport,A Arriens,Netherlands,Everything went smoothly as expected. Clean airport air conditioned. Friendly people handling at the gate is accurate. When departing from the U.S. Departures terminal either be one of the first ones out or really take your 3hrs time to follow all the protocols.,9,1
aruba-reina-beatrix-airport,Serge Plyshevski,Canada,Very long wait for luggage and very slow check-in. If you are flying to a place other than the USA you have to check-in in a separate pavilion with only 8 seats for a crowd of people lining up. After arrivals I needed some information about a local car rental company - the lady at information desk continued chatting on the phone paying no attention to me. We got the feeling that we were lucky to fly through that airport without any big delays.,5,0
aruba-reina-beatrix-airport,Whitnye Bivens,United States,My husband and I arrived at the airport at 2 pm for our flight departing at 4.40 pm. At 2.15 pm we began to hear comments that the flight was delayed until 7.30 pm. The flight monitor was never updated and an announcement was never made. We finally made it to the front of the line at 3.30 pm and asked if they could make an announcement regarding the flight status. A staff member began to re-book our flight. We asked if she could tell us what flight she was re-booking us for. She walked away and never came back. In Aruba you have to pick up your checked luggage and take it through customs which closes at 4 pm and re- check it. At 3.50 pm we stood waiting for our luggage. At 3.58 pm it finally arrived. Cleared customs and again went through security. Two girls stood talking while we're waiting to have our passports checked. Made it to gate 7 at 4.10 pm which still showed our flight departing at 4.40 pm. Asked if we were too late to board and was told it was now departing from gate 8. After several people in line became belligerent at 5.30 pm a staff member stated the flight was delayed until 7.30 pm. Several more people had been unknowingly re- booked to standby. Aruba was great unfortunately we'll never go back because of the horrible airport service.,1,0
aruba-reina-beatrix-airport,C Georgelas,United States,Departed this airport on a flight that was to leave at 4.20 pm. Our first trip to Aruba and we had a wonderful time until we tried to leave. During our stay other guests told us to make sure we arrive 3 hours prior to departure to allow extra time to clear US Customs and regular security. When we arrived we found absolute chaos! The lines were long and slow no room to move or sit down. Our plane was 45 mins late to leave. No vacation should end this way.,3,0
aruba-reina-beatrix-airport,P Littlefair,,Seems to be a quite pleasant little airport. International arrivals baggage claim and immigration straightforward. On departure although being warned to allow 3 hours to clear check-in & US immigration (as UK citizen) the whole process took 55 minutes kerbside to gate. Gate area presentable a few small shops and snack areas.,4,0
aruba-reina-beatrix-airport,B Tromp,,Nice airport friendly staff. US pre-clearance is a plus point. Negatives: immigration is slow and the part between check in and immigration is outside (no AC),3,0
aruba-reina-beatrix-airport,Andre Souza,,AUA is a nice airport pre US border control is a plus! mmost of the taxes are not included on your ticket! the hassles are: slow immigration I counted over 50 people in each line (there were 6) the snack machines inside the departure hall only accept US coins so you should spend your last aruba florin coins outside!,3,0
astana-airport,Alibek Taizhanov,Kazakhstan,Astana airport is small but very good. The staff is ok. The wifi connection works pretty well queuing times are very short. There is only a few shops in the airport but that seems to be enough for it. The exterior and interior design is very good.,10,1
astana-airport,M Foote,Russian Federation,This airport has excellent free wifi but lacks any decent shops or restaurants. I stayed in the airport for 5 hrs whilst waiting for a connecting flight. The check-in agent wouldn't check my bag through so I was stuck at the airport. The best area for wifi is on the 2nd floor. There are power-points behind the bench seats for charging your laptop. Airside there are small shops and a cafe/bar at the very end of the departure lounge where the wifi doesn't work. As a capital city airport it is lacking in many of the things one would expect. Without the wifi it would be very hard to pass the time waiting for connecting flights.,4,0
astana-airport,Jack Sheldon,,Small ultramodern terminal. Check-in was fairly efficient except for flatheads who queue-jumped. In the end I had to spread my elbows to get attention. Business-class desk not manned. Unable to check-in bags or myself to connecting flights (even on the same airline). There’s not a great deal to do in the airport whilst waiting for flights. Once airside all there is is a small bar. In theory the terminal is non- smoking though there is a separate smoking room but the whole terminal smelt of smoke most of the time I was there.,,0
asturias-airport,N White,United Kingdom,A great little regional airport located right on the edge of the coast whose baggage reclaim passport control and lounge are all currently being refurbished and expanded. The airport is clean and tidy and has a delightful cafe/restaurant downstairs before security as well as a great little shop selling local artisan products. Check- in can be slow as there are no self-service check-in facilities. Note that once you go past security facilities are currently fairly scant (small bar area and no shops).,7,1
asturias-airport,Roland Rodriguez,United States,Went to OVD on a day trip from BCN in mid June 2010 to visit family in nearby Castrillon. I seen the airport evolve for the last thirty years into a very nice compact and efficient operation. Everything is laid out in a logical sequence. You arrive into a small check-in area as there are still less than a half dozen or so carriers that use it go through a quick and orderly screening area and up to the gates. There are various shops to include a regional Asturias gift shop stores transportation outlets and the such. Public areas are clean and not crowded by any means. There is the typical cafe with lots of room and reasonable pricing. We found taxis right outside the terminal along with two bays for ALSA busses running to both Oviedo and Gijon. Be advised that the trip to the provincial cities of Oviedo Gijon and Aviles all take about a half hour or so to get to. All in all a very nice user-friendly airport.,5,0
asturias-airport,Martyn Davies,,Nice clean provincial airport handy for Asturias Cantabria and Galicia. The check-in hall is spacious and on the occasions I've used it it has always been hassle-free. The cafe is large and reasonably priced and the toilets clean. There are a half dozen care hire booths in the airport. I always use the bus to get into and out of Oviedo. It is cheap (@5 euros single) and runs regularly from the stop outside the arrivals hall. Regular buses also run to Gijon and Aviles. There are plentiful taxis if you want a more expensive drive in. The only mild criticism I have of the airport is the time it takes to get through customs on arrival. Other than that a pleasant airport which nearly makes flying pleasurable.,,0
asuncion-silvio-pettirossi-airport,Jonathan Lacoste,,Asuncion is a small and simple airport. From airport gate to curbside the distance is no more than 50 meters. Upon arrival on AA (this was last month before AA cancelled their service to ASU) immigration was quick and efficient but baggage claim seemed to take forever. I must’ve waited for over 40 minutes which was unusual. Baggage claim in ASU is slow but not that slow. Be prepared when arriving into Asuncion’s baggage claim area to be swarmed by baggage porters looking to make a big tip. As soon as you tell one “no” another one will approach you. Departure wise the departure hall is not that big and can easily get crowded. Especially between the hours of 1600-1800 when flights to Buenos Aires and a couple of flights to Sao Paulo are departing around that time block. It seems in Asuncion when one person is going out of the country at least six relatives show up to say goodbye. Thus the departure hall can easily turn into a sea of people. There are two small restaurants on each side of the departure hall but these were full of departing passengers and their large number of relatives/friends. Check-in quick and efficient. AA had Asuncion’s departure tax already included in the ticket price so I skipped the departure tax window. I’m not sure if Varig does the same and Dale’s review answers the question on TAM. No line for immigration and it’s off to wait in the departure gate area. A restaurant is inside that allows for a bite to eat or a final opportunity to sample Paraguay’s local beers. I always chose the latter. A number of street-style shops selling Paraguayan leather and lace products are located in the middle of the gate area. Between them and the duty free shop in the corner of the waiting area I really couldn’t find anything worth buying. Business class passengers on AA did not have a business class lounge to wait in and I saw no indication of one for Varig’s business class passengers either. TAM flights into Asuncion are all Y configured. ASU has made some improvements over the years such as the addition of the duty free shop. Overall Asuncion’s airport is a basic and “gets the job done” type of airport.,,0
asuncion-silvio-pettirossi-airport,Dale Hancock,,The Asuncion terminal is small – perhaps half a dozen gates. Arrival was simple – though the plane had to stop short of the jet way lower the cabin door / stairs then taxi up to the jetway (TAM uses Fokker jets). Through passport control with no issues. While waiting for the baggage to be unloaded we were “found” by a rep from the Hotel Excelsior (the $110/nt suite included pick-up & drop-off at the airport). He helped us through the customs line (though the help certainly wasn’t needed) then on to the outside world where another contact with our name awaited. I asked about money exchange (zero Guarani for tips) & the initial contact took us over to a Hertz booth where we exchanged money. Most likely not the best rate. In retrospect the first contact was probably a local minion with the ability to get through to the Customs area & pass himself off as our legitimate contact all for a little “propina” which he was not hesitant to ask for once we got to our car. For departure we left the hotel at 4:30 AM for our 6:00 AM flight arriving with just less than an hour before flight time. No problems. TAM was efficient this time (see report under SCL) and check-in was completed in 10 minutes or less. Then on to the airport tax window – to the left of the check-in counters & to the right of the entry for passport control. $25 US p/p departure tax. The lady didn’t have US dollar change so we paid $310000 Guarani – probably not a very good rate but it allowed us to leave the country with essentially zero local currency. Through the departure doors & the lady immediately to the left verifies you’ve paid your taxes & stamps the receipt. Then to the immigration officer. Again no problems. In the gate area with 30 minutes to spare. Harp music playing free drinks (coffee soda water) at a little TAM kiosk. Restrooms are difficult to find – to the right of gate 2. It’s 5:30 in the morning and a few of the duty-free (mostly local craft) shops are actually open. For such a poor country with limited resources ASU appears to be surprisingly well managed and efficient.,,0
athens-airport,M Dalton,Switzerland,Athens airport is clean and is well equipped. Staff are friendly. Some signage could be improved especially when one arrives from Beirut and searches for Terminal B. Otherwise it's a good place to travel through. Business line at security is very useful.,8,1
athens-airport,Athanasios Kleftaras,Greece,"A very good airport! Spacious, very clean, well decorated and has good signage! The check in counters employees are very polite and doing their job. The airport has a lot of stores, meaning that anyone can find anything he/she wants to buy. The security check is very easy to access and the employees are very fast. They are also very willing to help you if you have any questions.  Going to the gate was easy as the signage was clear,the screens showing you estimated time to reach your gate were very clever and usefull. I reccomend this airport both for departing and arriving at it so for using it as a transit point!",9,1
athens-airport,M McManus,Belgium,The airport has a good selection of shops and restaurants. If you have a connecting flight you have to leave arrivals then go back in to departures. This is slightly unusual as most airports in the world allow you to continue a connection without having to leave where you arrived. Staff were pretty friendly. The wifi issued a security certificate warning when I tried to open it this may be nothing but be aware of it. Information screens precise and signage was good.,6,1
athens-airport,Josef Sonntag,Israel,Use this airport for transfer flight to Tel-Aviv.

Airport - modern and clean lot of shops and restaurants.,7,1
athens-airport,J Huang,Taiwan,The passport control is fast when arrived (10 PM). The direction to airport train is confusing and hard to differentiate the track from airport train and suburban train.

athens-airport,M Tossounian,United Kingdom,Travelling through Athens Airport is a very comfortable and pleasant experience. Check-in areas are clearly marked and easy to locate with polite and efficient staff. Passport control is quick and once airside you are met with a very good selection of duty free shops of a high standard offering a big selection of goods. The food shops in particular have a plentiful supply of delicious Greek products with very polite and knowledgeable staff. Seating areas in departure lounges are comfortable with plenty of seats the Business lounges are excellent and there a toilets throughout the airport which are very clean. A great airport.,10,1

athens-airport,Y Golemis,Germany,Everything in this airport makes sense. Friendly spotlessly clean easy to navigate efficient well manned it's an airport one wants to come back over and over. Perhaps it needs a little refurbishment. It's already 15 years old it starts showing its age and operators should think about improving a few things mainly the general ambience.,10,1
athens-airport,John Plevris,United Kingdom,Recent travel over Christmas period. Clean efficient airport well organised easy to get through security timely arrival of luggage. Overall a very functional comfortable airport with a generous 60 min free Internet.,10,1
athens-airport,William Horn,United States,I'm not a frequent international traveler but I've been through several airports in Latin America Europe and Africa and few of them are as nice or as well run as Eleftherios Venizelos.

The facility is clean staff has always seemed quite friendly food service is good and varied. This is not an airport to dread by any means.,9,1
athens-airport,M Menon,Greece,I have traveled many times from and to Athens. It small compared to other but its clean very nice friendly staff and security. Facilities are good and clean. Immigration check all the counters everything is absolutely perfect. The only negative aspect I might point out is. The last time I was traveling I found some beggars begging inside the airport. This is very rare scene its pity never experienced it before. I guess they must step up security a bit to avoid any future problems that can happen due to entry of everybody and anybody inside airport.,8,1
athens-airport,Dmitry Kuzin,Russian Federation,Very good airport. It is very spacious and bright there are a lot of check-in counters thus no crowds. The seats in the waiting areas are comfortable and you can enjoy free wi-fi in the terminal. Plenty of Duty Free shops with nice prices. Friendly security. A lot of jet bridges. Baggage always alright. I would definitely recommend ATH to transfer through even with a long stop-over.,10,1
athens-airport,Michael Dalton,Switzerland,Excellent airport. Fast and friendly security. Lots of check in counters. Lots of seats AR boarding gates. Airport staff friendly and helpful. Lots of good shops. A good place to transit too.,10,1
athens-airport,K Dermitzakis,United Kingdom,I had a really good experience returning from Christmas holiday. Very well organised and clean airport. Spacious lounges and variety of shops. The only thing to flag is they are fairly expensive compared to London Heathrow for example.,8,1
athens-airport,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,Modern clean spacious enough and no queues when we arrived. The arrivals hall is peculiarly deprived of toilets (there are toilets but at either extreme end). Helpful information desk staff (though not all that friendly). This airport is a long drive from the city but the taxi prices are fixed by law which gives a lot of reassurance to tourists.,9,1
athens-airport,M Tossounian,United Kingdom,Arrived at ATH from LHR which is a complete mess in comparison. Had 60 mins transit time for a connection to Mykonos. The arrival area was clean spacious and bright. Arrived at the departure gate for the connection in plenty of time. No problems at all. Spent a day in Athens for the return flight to LHR so arrived at airport by taxi. Approach roads to airport are in excellent condition with clear and ample signs. Drop off is right outside departures with the Aegean check in area right in front. Check in was quick efficient and polite. Duty free area is well positioned throughout the departure concourse with plenty of shops and products for sale. It's a bright clean and professional airport with facilities for all. A pleasure to use it.,10,1
athens-airport,J Batterly,Canada,I like this airport. It is bright has good shops security lines are fast and there are museum displays that are very interesting. It is easy to get around. Overall a good experience although I found that some of the bathrooms smelled a bit unpleasant.,8,1
athens-airport,D Leston,United Kingdom,Love the 'new' Athens airport. I hadn't visited the city since the old airport had closed - what a difference. Clean light smart building smiling staff (for the most part) good facilities which I made the most of since my return flight was delayed - so I ended up spending 4 hours there. Good connections to the centre of Athens by metro and at only €8 a bargain.,8,1
athens-airport,S Vartanyan,United States,Access is so easy with either train bus or metro to the centre very spacious not chaotic even during the busy times quick and hassle free check-in. Additionally the Sofitel airport nearby is a good option if you have an early flight it is only a 5 mins walk from the terminal!,10,1
athens-airport,Jim Adams,Canada,The airport is well designed and clean. It is easy to navigate and you do not have to cover vast distances like some others ie: FRA. I used it many times the last 6 years and I never left with negative impressions.,10,1
athens-airport,Azlan Hashim,Malaysia,Departed early morning out of Athens to Istanbul. The airport was pretty busy but almost all check-in counters were manned and the check-in agents were quite efficient. Immigration and security staff were friendly and smiling.,4,0
athens-airport,Paul Huguet,France,I recently departed from Athens and found the airport to be on the lower end of what one would expect of a modern European airport. Security control was a mess and the security staff were not polite at all trying to make a complaint is very difficult no manager no customer service. Passengers largely formed masses rather than lines - airport staff only added to the confusion by barking illogical orders.,1,0
athens-airport,S Schonfeld,Germany,Very clean well signed spacious short walking distances no queues (security took 1 minute) great shops with local products. There is a cafe outside the departures hall where you can sit and drink your coffee under the sun and very cheap. Good connection with the city with trains buses and taxis. Staff very polite and helpful.,5,0
athens-airport,D Keenan-Bokr,Germany,Passport control and baggage clearance was quick. The Metro is only a few minutes away and costs EUR6 to get into the city. Takes about 45mins. Beware of pickpockets on this Metro especially if it get busy. They work as groups and take advantage of travellers speaking a language that is not Greek. We left our larger suitcase at baggage storage which is in the arrivals hall all the way at the end. It cost us EUR9 for 12 hours. There is a good selection of cafes a McDonalds and a couple of restaurants which were expensive. Staff were friendly.,4,0
athens-airport,K Nielsen,Denmark,A great experience on both arrival and departure. On arrival needed to walk no more than 3 minutes to go to the baggage belts and the first suitcases had already arrived. With a few steps you are outside the arrivals lounge. A few shops and offices there. Taxis and buses to different parts of the city are right outside the arrivals. If you want to use the train you need to walk a bit further. The train station is surprisingly clean trains new and clean. On departure check-in fast airport staff helpful and friendly. Very well signed and information screens everywhere. The only negative is that you have to pay for the baggage trolleys. Good selection of shops a bit expensive as in all the airports. Security control was busy that day at 15.00 I needed to queue up for about 7-10 minutes. After security control there are no shops (only some cafes) so if you want shopping remember to do that before.,4,0
athens-airport,T Moxham,South Korea,Used this airport twice over summer. The queues for passport control to leave the country were terrible. Nearly an hour's wait with people constantly being taken to the front because their flights were boarding. Why do they check people so carefully to leave when countries such as Britain don't even bother with passport control when departing? The terminal was also very hot. Otherwise it was a pleasant experience.,4,0
athens-airport,I Nadareishvili,Georgia,I used metro to go to Athens from the airport which was very comfortable and fast for 6 euros only. To go to the airport from the city I used a metro train to Plaentias station and then changed to Proastiakos subburban train which was almost empty air conditioned fast clean and comfortable. Airport check in was quite fast in a big bright hall. Many signs showing directions to gates passport control toilets and all other necessary information. There are a lot of shops with souvenirs music CDs different beverages sweets olive oil and all the other food. Most of such shops have reasonable prices but some I found to be a bit expensive compared to the city. The airport is not overcrowded which helps a lot even in top of tourist season. Staff is pleasant and ready to help and explain anything you may ask. Luggage is easy to find and everything goes very quickly. You need just some minutes before you leave the airport when arriving Athens. The only obvious problem about this airport is the passport control - both in arrivals and departures. when arrived a huge crowd of people from different planes went into one small hall with few officers working there. If you have Greek passport - it is OK but for non EU citizen it was about 15 minutes of waiting. Same when departing though in departures there is much more space but again in many cabins only few officers were working. Good thing is they don't take much time checking anything and the crowd goes quite quickly.,5,0
athens-airport,Bob by Giannakopoulos,Canada,I've use this airport a couple of times this summer. It's a nice airport and well connected to Athens. However for Non-EU passport holders the waiting was long to pass the passport control when I took my flights from Canada and Tunisia. Not all the desk were opened and there was many arrivals too. Also when I took my flight back to Montreal there was a long disorganized and chaotic line due to extra security measures to pass the security control.,4,0
athens-airport,S Amster,United States,I recently departed from Athens and found the airport to be on the lower end of what one would expect of a modern European airport. Passport control was a mess. Passengers largely formed masses rather than lines - airport staff only added to the confusion by barking illogical orders. Food services limited before passport control and non-existant after passport control. Security screening staff didn't seem to care about their work. Passengers beeped and were sent through without further search. I cleared through despite having liquids in my bags (which I only realized once through).,2,0
athens-airport,M Frari,United Kingdom,An excellent airport for me one of the best in Europe. Transport from and to the airport from central Athens is easy with a few options available (just remember to validate your bus or metro ticket or a big fine will happen!) Great facilities it even has a small museum displaying the ancient artifacts discovered while building the airport. Good choice of food for good prices large range of other shops to pass the time before the flight. Security staff are very friendly and pleasant with no huge queues. Departing from this airport is a great way to end your holiday to this beautiful country.,5,0
athens-airport,K Spanopoulos,Greece,Transportation to airport is very good airport nice and clean with some smoking areas and free internet to use. The only negative is the prices of food which is relatively high.,4,0
athens-airport,R Skopac,,Spacious clean airport good range of shops and places for snack or coffee great subway connection with city centre and Pireaus. Security check staff not pleasant at all.,4,0
athens-airport,K Sagia,,A user friendly airport. Adequate priced food courts and nice shopping area. Not a gem architecturally wise but efficient. Big drawbacks : the payment of trolley and lack of viewer's terrace,4,0
athens-airport,C Rocha,,The subway link to the airport is working again. It take you 40-45 minutes time from Syntagma station to the airport. Good selection of shops and food outlets. Beware that after the security checkpoints to the gates you don’t have anything beside some small kiosks with basic sandwiches and beverages. You have to pay for de luggage trolley. It is an efficiently run airport at arrivals and the departures if you belong to the schengen area.,4,0
athens-airport,Brian Cose,,So many people smoking in the airport. It can get crowded at times especially at Olympic and Aegean Airlines. I found the Olympic Business Class Lounge to be a joke. I did find the Security and airport staff to be polite and helpful. They helped me numerous times with different problems. Security Screening is fast efficient and easy-going. No stress which makes a difference. Overall I was not impressed with Athens Airport I would avoid it if I could.,3,0
athens-airport,Alan Ho,,A nice airport with a good range of shops and places to have a bite and coffee interesting free airport magazine place all over the terminal building friendly staff nice music has been play throughout the terminal building and pretty short walking distance (when compare to other major airports in europe) had a enjoyable experience there.,5,0
athens-airport,T Karapiperis,,Athens Airport must be the only Airport in the world that has more places for smoking than for non-smoking. The moment you enter the airport you can smell/see cigarette smoke.,3,0
athens-airport,A Hetier,,Clean and efficient. Check-in takes only a few seconds. However sometimes there are queues at passport control from Schengen to non-Schengen area (towards gates numbered A). A variety of food options which maybe could afford a little more space but obviously shopping is a priority. Not a beautiful building but it is functional and one does not feel uncomfortable in it. The only thing I don't really like is having to pay for baggage trolleys. Overall Athens airport is not bad!,4,0
athens-airport,B Giannakopoulos,,Check in went fast with friendly staff. Well connected with majors parts of Athens like Sytagma or the intercity bus stations (ktel) and surrounding towns. by any mean of transportation (like bus train or metro). Use time waiting for a flight by visiting the small museum and the chapel both located in the second floor. Good variety of shops and cafes - not too overpriced. On the other hand they should announce at least boarding or last calls. They use to do it before I wonder why they stopped.,4,0
athens-airport,Andreas Larsen,,Transited through the airport there and every time I get the same good experience with clean waiting areas and enough seating space and good variety of shops available both before and after security in addition to being well maintained. The staff are helpful every time although they don't always smile but at the end of a stressful day I suppose this is not always easy. What I don't like though are the high temperatures inside the terminal sometimes I just felt so warm that I had to go out and take some fresh air while waiting for my connecting flight. All in all the airport of Athens offers good quality and always a nice experience flying through this airport.,4,0
athens-airport,Eric Geroulis,,Very spacious clean and despite the criticism of its architecture the interior has an ultra-modern design. And lots of light. It does not have a huge selection of restaurants but it certainly has more (and better quality) restaurants than much larger airports. The shopping/dining area is large relative to the main terminal's small size. I have never experienced long ques at this aiport. Distance from Athens city center is not that big.,5,0
athens-airport,Ira Rahmawati,,Better than I expected. Arrival was OK. The immigration officers were efficient. But had to wait nearly 40 minutes by the conveyor belt to get my checked-in luggage. The public transportation to the city was well- organized. Used it again for departure. I arrived 3 hours before my scheduled flight. Big mistake. They didn't have enough chairs for to spend my 3 hours before departure while they didn't let me enter the departure lounge before 1 hour prior to my scheduled flight. he shops were ok. One note for the tourists looking for souvenirs: buy them at the airport because the prices there are actually cheaper than anywhere else in Greece.,4,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Odmar Almeida-Filho ,Brazil,"Expect very long lines at immigration and security check. About one hour each, based on my most recent 4 trips into ATL from abroad, over the last couple months. Clearly the demand far exceeds the capacity when Delta int'l inbound flights cram in between 5am and 9am, making this airport the worst port of entry into the US.",3,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Tina Bello,United States,"The lines to go through customs and immigration were far too long, it took several hours to make it to our connecting flight. The staff were incompetent, and the immigration officer asked me to translate for him, since no German speaking personnel was available. My husband tried to wait for me while I did this, and got rudely directed to leave the area, so we got separated. Finally made it through and then had to re-check our luggage and go through security again. Another endlessly long line, no signs as to what to do, and no help from rude personnel. I've had better experiences on previous trips, the airport seemed to be very overwhelmed with the number of travelers. Wifi was a hassle to 'sign up' for.",3,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Amanda Farrell,United States,"This airport was very frustrating! It is, in no way, wheelchair or stroller friendly. I was traveling with my infant son and I had him in a stroller. I departed from Atlanta and then later arrived in Atlanta. When I was departing I noticed the gates are very crowded and tight and no matter where you try to park a stroller or wheelchair you are going to be blocking a walkway or other seats. Also the bathrooms are very tight and constricted. This became very difficult upon my arrival back to Atlanta when the bathroom was busy and crowded. There is no changing station. So you have to use a counter which is not safe for infants as there is no way to strap my child down. Also the handicapped stalls are barely big enough to fit my stroller let alone myself in there with it. The elevators are not clearly marked and I had to walk around in circles looking for them. Not to mention they are small and barely big enough for one person and a stroller/wheelchair. There was a line of about 5 wheelchairs and 5 families with stollers waiting to use the only 2 available elevators. They need to update their airport in order to accomedate their customers. Very disappointed!",1,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Michael Davies,United Kingdom,"Arrival at the International terminal at 8pm on the British Airways flight from London. As we previously had visited the USA, had a valid ESTA and a machine readable passport we were able to use the passport machines. Quite straightforward and my wife and I were able to get clearance in the same transaction. A little tricky getting our finger prints in the correct position on the scanner. The machines printed out a form which we handed to the immigration agent. A few brief questions and a passport stamp and we were through. This was much the quicker route than traditional queuing. Bags arrived promptly and 30 minutes after getting off the plane we were standing at the taxi rank. Some airport hotels don't send their shuttles to the international terminal so we took a taxi to the Hampton Inn College Park. About $15 and well worth it. The alternative would be to take a shuttle to the domestic terminal and then wait for a hotel shuttle. A most pleasant arrival, we were having our first beer in a restaurant 60 minutes after arrival. Departure - Dropped off our car at the central rental centre. A shuttle bus took us to the international terminal. The bus arrived after 5 minutes waiting - but it was small and some people were left behind. We arrived at the terminal 3 hours before our flight at about 7pm and no queues at the BA check in desk and security was very quick. Didn't do any shopping and went upstairs to the food court. I cant say I was impressed. An expensive restaurant and 4-5 fast food outlets. Similar to a shopping mall but twice the price. My recommendation is to eat before you get to the airport if you want a good meal at reasonable prices. Fortunately, we were able to use the Club lounge. Boarding a little bit chaotic as a full flight and a lot of carry on luggage, that the gate agents put many bags in the hold. Overall, a smooth departure.",8,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,P Cross,United States,Airports by nature are places where people are passing through for the first time. Very clear signage is the only there for critical for a decent airport experience. Atlanta was a huge fail in this regard.,2,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Donald Finlay,United Kingdom,Contrary to some reports here and given Atlanta is the world's busiest airport I found the experience very good. Deplaning from another excellent Virgin Atlantic flight at an early 2pm arrival I was through immigration collecting my bag through customs and transferring my bag to the connecting transfer belt within 30 minutes. Maybe I was lucky? The only queue was security through to domestic flights but then the airport train was quick and excellent. Very good signing if you open your eyes. I arrived at concourse B within 45 minutes from touching down.,8,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Tay Rubble,United Kingdom,Nightmare airport where the poor reputation is well deserved. Arrived from UK tired but happy after a fantastic Virgin Premium experience ruined by staff shouting but impatient if one asked for an explanation as to what to do. Pointless system of checking in electronically to have a big black cross because apparently I had been to America 5 years ago. I then queued for over an hour to be asked why had I not been back in 5 years. So I had been told by Virgin that luggage would be checked through it was not - I had to queue at electronic service then queue for immigration then queue at customs then queue to get bags through security again. Had to stand in a booth with hands raised above my head and then could go through - the shocker was how far the gates were apart. Make sure you take the train - I am pretty fit but after walking 20 mins had only done gate E and I needed A. I was hungry and tired and with a 2 hour layover had to go straight to boarding - not even a drink of water Deltas boarding was confusing and still don't know how it worked - so on my flight and no food at all as it was only 2 hours - they served a drink and a bag of pretzels the size of a teabag! Lessons learned - high probability of missing your flight - definitely take the train- buy food for flight if you have the time. Hoping my return flight will be better but now concerned.,,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Dan Glesby,Canada,Feb 12. Connect through ATL from MSP to FLL. This was the second worst airport I have travelled through only better than Paris CDG. I knew it was a crazy busy airport but it was far busier than I had thought. Very long walks had about an hour and a half. Lot's of walking involved but I don't mind the exercise. The part that made me sour the most was getting lunch. Lot's of food choices but nowhere to sit. Not the airport's fault but went to a Mexican place and they gave me someone else's order. I will try to avoid this airport whenever possible. Too bad it is a Delta hub because Delta is one my preferred airlines. Also there restrooms were hard to find albeit very large in size.,2,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Amanda Silveira,United States,Jan 14 2015 reached Atlanta at 5.30 with my family for a connecting flight to Wichita KS. Unfortunately there were immigration lines of nearly 75 people with 3 officers. Staff did not care whether you had a connecting flight. Our next flight was at 7.20 many people had the same problem but no separate lines. We understand the process but unfortunately nothing is organised and staff had no concern. Got done with the line at 6.50. Running through baggage claim and security check it was 7.10. Took the train and reached the gate at 7.18 where gates were closed and we missed the last flight to Wichita. Our next flight to Wichita was at 9.15 am on 15th sat at b16 the whole time until we went to a1 to board our flight the next morning. No one cares about the inconvenience caused due to man made problems if only everything was more organized and controlled.,,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,K Emrich,Ireland,Flying from Dublin to San Francisco and back with Delta changed flights in Atlanta. First time in Atlanta. Was a very pleasant experience. As we had cleared immigration in Dublin was able to go straight from international terminal to domestic. Airport is well laid out really easy to find your way. Was able to walk around all the terminals which was great. When transferring at Newark O'Hare or Dulles in the past was restricted to a tiny area of the airport which quickly got very boring. So being able to walk around in Atlanta was great. Facilities in the airport were good and there was a good selection of shops cafes and bars. And the wifi worked very well. Overall a very good experience which matched my experience of Delta. Delta my new favourite American airline and Atlanta new favourite American airport.,8,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Lorraine Sauer,United States,January 10 2015 Came in from St Lucia. Took us 2.5 hours to clear customs. Everyone missed their flights. I've never seen such chaos!,1,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Jacob Molendijk,Netherlands,Arrived from AMS after an 10 our flight on Dec 18th 17.30 and passing Immigration's took us and many co- travellers over 50 minutes. The new machines for self check-in accepted my applications and printed out the form but for both with an X. So we had to stand in line again and as there were only 2 officers for more than 100 people waiting this is a very poor service for international travelers spending their money in the USA. We missed our connecting plane to Fort Lauderdale and only the good Delta customer service made it possible that we got to our destination same day.,,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,S Koenig,United States,Arrived at Terminal A on a domestic flight departed from Terminal F on international flight. No problems finding and catching the shuttle train between terminals. Terminal F seems nice but I didn't see much of it other than the Delta Sky Club and the nearby boarding gate. All in all a comfortable experience.,8,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,R Pym,United Kingdom,Arrived from the UK on Delta and was impressed with immigration. Enough staff were on duty to ensure that there was no wait. Transfer onto a Delta domestic flight was hassle free. On our return the connection to Manchester was missed due to poor weather conditions in the Midwest. After a very long wait to get rebooked we transferred from Terminal E to the new International terminal F. we were left underwhelmed by the choice of restaurants especially ones with table service. we ended up with an expensive food court meal. this spoilt the overall Atlanta experience.,7,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,A Long,United States,Connecting flight out of Atlanta. It's one of those airports that gets the job done. No frills but decent. I actually think Atlanta does a pretty good job considering it's the busiest airport in the world.,7,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Christopher Garland,United States,Miserable nasty employees. I've never encountered such rudeness and lack of customer service as from the employees at this airport. On Sunday Sept 28 the trains were down but their employees were barking and screaming at customers as if they were dogs. While employees were rushing by foot across the airport due to the trains being down your own employees blocked the moving walkways clearly not caring they people were late for connections. I heard employees mocking customers as well. This is by far the most unprofessional airport in the US. I strongly suggest you invest in customer service training for all employees and hold them accountable to being pleasant and helpful. Major fail Atlanta.,,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,J Krinsky,United States,Flew out of Atlanta to JFK on 09/04/14. We used curbside check-in. The agent was very nice and professional. No problems going through security. Atlanta has many eating establishments and shops after going through security. I was very impressed. All employees working in shops and the eating establishments were very friendly.,10,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,D Jeffrey,Canada,Bad experience for just a 2.5hr. layover on domestic connection. Facilities are out-of-date few shops/eateries within easy walking distance bathrooms scarce to say the least (had to walk 10 gates to find one!). Desperately need moving walkways in the concourses themselves. Only experienced 'E' and 'A' concourses but as I said old dirty sad facilities claustrophobic poor a/c no moving walkways! Had to laugh at some of the comments here that the facility is 'clean' or that there is 'ample seating'! Don't know how ATL fixes these outdated concourse problems considering their lack of space and huge Delta network! Good luck! Avoiding this airport at all costs and with only 1 minuscule glimpse into it's op's.,3,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Brian E Smith,Japan,Connected from an international flight to a domestic one. Immigration and Customs procedures went quickly. This is the second arrival from an international flight to ATL and I can say it's pretty awful which is surprising since they have a fairly new international terminal! The walk from the gate to immigration can take 20 minutes which could be a problem for someone in a wheelchair or any disability. Immigration lines are long for foreign passengers but they do have new computer scanners for US citizens which help make it faster. However waiting for luggage was another 20 minute wait and I'm premium with Delta and my bags were among the first to come off. Then getting to the domestic terminal to get to MARTA or local ATL transport is another shuttle bus service away. The airport is huge and quite impressive but this new international terminal has its own separate exit from the domestic terminal and is really a separate entity. I will consider another international gateway in the future. Connecting to domestic flights is a bit easier than what I experienced but I can say that ATL is not a smooth experience especially after coming off a 12 hour flight from Tokyo. Traveling from a domestic flight to international is a different story. It is a fairly good experience.,4,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,S Koenig,Brazil,Connected from an international flight to a domestic one. Immigration and Customs procedures went quickly. Requested a wheelchair through the airline and one was waiting and proceeded quickly to a lounge in the international terminal and then later on to Terminal B for our domestic flight. It's a big airport and certain terminals (e.g. B) can get particularly crowded but the trains help and overall our experience was good.,7,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,A Pease,France,Having arrived from BSL via LHR (where I had a 7 hour layover) at 19H30 local time I was a bit concerned about then facing a long delay for immigration and baggage reclaim. However I was very pleasantly surprised a clearly sign-posted corridor and plenty of 'self-service' immigration machines for scanning my passport. Of course I made a mess of trying to use it but was immediately helped by a joyous friendly and welcoming TSA southern lady who then passed me over to a male colleague who checked my paper slip with a large smile and invited me to continue to baggage reclaim. The whole process took around 10 mins even though the immigration area was full. Baggage reclaim was well-signed and I was landside approximately 10 minutes after that. Well done ATL for clear signage an abundance of helpful staff and a delightfully friendly welcome.,10,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,A Williams,United States,This is the worst airport next to LAX staff have no regard or respect for customers. I had an early flight at 6am and the staff that worked the check in booth did not show up until 5.30 when they did arrive they all had attitudes. Before this it had taken us an hour to find the park and ride in that unorganized poorly managed establishment. When we eventually found the park and ride nobody could give us any direction as to what shuttle to get on. When we got to the check in booth like I said the workers came late then told us that our bags were late and that they may or may not make it. We flew all the way to San Jose worried that our bags wouldn't make it luckily they did but the flight back to Atlanta was horrendous. My bag didn't make it we went through the lost baggage process they gave me the run around on the whereabouts of my suitcase and finally the day after we flew in they found it.,,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,M Neave,United Kingdom,If you are an international traveller I don't recommend using Atlanta Hartsfield after flying in from the UK the lines for immigration were long even though all the booths seemed to be manned they were a lot of non speaking English people arriving so translators were required which made the wait longer. Once cleared immigration had another queue to get through customs then the worst thing is you have to recheck your baggage and go through security why when you have got off an international flight and not left the terminal do you have to go through security. All this queuing took over two hours and i made my connecting flight with minutes to spare avoid Atlanta if at all possible. Also food outlets at the international departures is abysmal and very expensive just had a beer at the bar and for a large Bud they charged me $12.55 and had the nerve to include an 18% gratuity charge.,1,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Kevin Tunnicliffe,United Kingdom,Pleasantly surprised at this airport which has received bad press in the past. No queues at either immigration or security. On leaving the whole process took less than five minutes from bag drop to getting airside. All staff except one woman on security were pleasant and helpful. Maybe she was simply having a bad day!,10,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,H Oberbeckmann,Germany,We were in ATL as transit passengers and had a really good experience. Even if the airport is so huge immigration was fast and queuing times were short. There was a food court and shops in our domestic terminal and the train between the terminals provides a fast transfer.,9,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,J Krinsky,United States,I agree with previous reviews of the shuttle system between the international and domestic terminal. I have been to almost every international airport in the US and overseas and I have never seen such an inefficient and stupid system. I found that the airport does not allow any outside ANY shuttle pick ups at the international terminal. This includes regional shuttles such as Groome Transportation to Columbus and Macon. You must go to the domestic terminal and ground transportation on a tiny airport shuttle bus. Try getting heavy suitcases onto one of these tiny shuttle busses and the driver yelling at you to hurry up. The international terminal is very nice but this shuttle system policy needs to change.,4,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Richard Schumaker,United States,"We rode the so-called ""wonderful"" shuttle to the international from the domestic. That is the most inefficient system I've seen. It's certainly not focused on the customer and I will never do that again. The shuttle from our Hyatt Hotel could not drop us at the International terminal. Instead we had to manage 9 bags on the stupid shuttle from the domestic. One of the worst systems I've seen. I will make other arrangements which will not include any hotel support. I talked with others and they are going to do the same.",3,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,G Hanold,United States,We returned from Cancun to find usual incompetence and inefficiencies at the airport. First ground crews are not prepared so the plane had to wait 15 minutes on the ground until the gate was readied. While sitting on the plane I noticed a member on the ground crew sitting under the jet bridge eating his lunch. We had similar experiences on our outbound flight through Atlanta with ground crews not readied. Next we're introduced to the US embarrassment known as the TSA. They are inefficient and rude. I usually fly Delta but will now try to avoid them - to avoid Atlanta.,,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,E Williams,United States,"Leaving for Argentina - all experiences very good. Returning - horrible! CBP personnel rude barking orders screaming at arriving passengers conspicuously impatient with travelers whose first language is not English. Long slow-moving lines inadequate staffing. TSA personnel also very rude. TSA lines for arriving passengers about to transfer are not equipped for Pre-Check. Airport itself is clean has many and high-quality shops and easy (via ""Plane Train"") to transfer among concourses. My recommendation ""Yes"" for airport is based on two thoughts: (1) it's excellent for domestic travel and (2) CBP and TSA personnel in my experience are just as nasty at all other US airports.",3,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Guy Senior,United Kingdom,The newish international terminal is a revelation. Fully staffed immigration desks and swift baggage meant that I was looking for a cab within 15 minutes of getting off the plane. A first in the USA! Swift check in (BA) and security on the way back too with a very smart range of shops after security. However the terminal is a bus ride from car rental or the domestic terminal and the inter terminal shuttle is only for checked in passengers.,10,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Susie Morgan,United Kingdom,I find it easy to navigate and it has plenty of shops and eateries. This time was no different. Though there was a queue at immigration the whole process including rechecking my bag and getting to the next terminal took no more than an hour.,10,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,R Girard,France,I travelled the last month through this airport and found it convenient and very well organized compared to Paris CDG airport. The shuttle connecting the different part of the terminal is very good and fast. I went 3 times to Atlanta airport and I can criticise the huge queue at the customs. They should fit some new counter customs.,7,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,J Wyatt,United States,"One person checking everyone's documents at the screening checkpoint in the morning. Really? TSA attitude was poor. They seem to forget they work for the citizens. Not enough places to plug in phones and laptops. Pricey wifi. Rude and intimidating airport employees. Many seem to be more concerned with talking to co-workers rather than doing their jobs. Very long walks. Lots of elderly were complaining and having a difficult time walking and schlepping bags. Why not offer continuous mini-tram rides pulled by golf carts up and down each concourse. Seems to me that would be a cheap and welcomed PR move. Management ought to have ""personal shoppers"" scrutinizing employees and weeding out those who don't care enough to perform well. On a positive note: We enjoyed the Varsity and Chick-fil-A during delays.",5,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,D Ward,Costa Rica,I was in transit Costa Rica to Europe and back in July and August. Outward bound all went well security staff pleasant and efficient a good restaurant and adequate shopping. Homeward bound in terminal E it was very different. Rude and abusive security staff no decent restaurant a duty free both being refurbished and with very little stock and the waiting area grubby and ill lit.,4,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,H Jackson,United States,"It is my understanding that when you travel to the US issues like Homeland Security safety order and Information to all travelers should be the number one thing. That's why I give the new Atlanta International Airport 3 stars! If you are an International traveler allow yourself proper timing when flying international this will help in your future travels. Atlanta is a busy airport by nature and the city of Atlanta and US Customs are always trying to provide the most courteous experience to all travelers. It is also known that when you arrive to Atlanta from anywhere in the World and you want to remain in Atlanta even with the new Terminal ""F"" International experience travelers have to hump a long 15-20 min walk to stay in Atlanta. There is not an established way to alleviate the discomfort of walking with your bags from Terminal ""E"" to the new Maynard H Jackson Terminal ""that's the price to pay to stay in a City where crime trash and homeless people are everywhere. If you are traveling Domestic there are no problems other than traveler safety like TSA.",2,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,J Quarles,United States,Extremely long lines clearing immigration today - 1.5 hrs - coupled with long lines are rude service personnel and inadequate ventilation yes this is the new facility! What an embarrassment to our city for the arriving international passengers.,4,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,A Milligan,United States,Just traveled to and from Florida through ATL I am disabled and my report includes he usual items: airport dirty announcements garbled and unprofessional gates very far apart often by train. As a disabled person: there was an uncertain wait for a chair at each point Scariest was drop off our rental car and Enterprise left us off on a traffic island by an elevator a skycap took me to airline; they took me through security to plane. Transport chairs were old heavy iron scuffed and filthy. Restrooms not accessible. Exhausting.,4,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,D Stone,United States,Terminal E. Well it's Atlanta so expect slow uninspired service from everyone. Aim low they might hit your expectations. The terminal is hot stuffy and suffers from a lack of ventilation.,5,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,E Marsh,Canada,Atlanta airport is one of the two busiest in the world so it has a lot of connections going through. Unfortunately it has some problems. Loud televisions that are everywhere. Finding a quiet spot to relax is nearly impossible. Payphones Where? The last time I visited (during 2012) I searched an entire terminal (and the terminals here are very long) to find a working payphone. I found several banks of phones that had been ripped out of the wall completely with no signs to explain why or where else to find a phone. There is no excuse for not having adequate payphones at the one of the world's two busiest airports. At other major airports (such as YVR in Vancouver or SEA in Seattle) there are plenty in good working order. Atlanta could learn a lot from Minneapolis airport (MSP).,4,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,J Krinsky,United States,My main complaint concerns ground transportation at the international terminal. The airport does not permit any pick-ups by regional hotel or downtown shuttle services (they do permit drop-offs). On arrival you must take a small shuttle bus to the domestic terminal and the ground transportation centre if you need a regional hotel or downtown shuttle van. Try getting 3 heavy suitcases on and off this small and crowded bus. I have never been to an airport with such an inconvenient and insufficient system. The airport should permit pick-ups at the international terminal! Otherwise I found Immigration and Customs to be fast and friendly compared to my last trip. I was out of the airport within 60 minutes of exiting the airplane. Even airport staff were friendly and helpful. Evidently management has worked to improve customer service compared to my past experiences at ATL.,8,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Arlene Robinson,United Kingdom,Landed at the international terminal for the first time in 18 months. There have been changes. The first thing that struck me was the never ending walk to get to security - it is a long long way. I was not happy about it until after I had gone through security (which was quite speedy - maybe 5-10 minutes). It was at this point that we realised that we had no double security check - no re-sending of luggage down to yet another carousel. Even taking into account the lengthy walk it was so much quicker to get through than with the old system. Anyone elderly or not entirely fir however will struggle with the walk. Our departure was also pleasant. Every thing was shiny and bright. Better choices for the food which actually looked nicely presented. The staff we encountered in all areas seemed much more pleasant than in past visits here are they happier in their new environment or is it a new criteria laid down by management to try to get a better reputation for the airport? One thing that was appreciated by the smoker with me was the smoking room that he found although it is not well sign-posted. These rooms must help the queuing situation as many times I have seen the smokers going out of airports and then having to go through security again - well done ATL. Whether arriving or departing from ATL there will be lengthy walks - the airport is vast. Get in training before your visit.,8,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,D Monrouzeau,Puerto Rico,SJU-ATL-CMH. Airport was fine. I had a wait time of 3 hours 25 minutes. The flight arrived very early so I had about 4 hours to kill. I found my terminal very easily. Everyone was very helpful and friendly and the airport tram was very nice. I didn't go to the Atrium so I wouldn't get lost. My main complaint with this airport was the Wifi. You had to pay a fee for every use. Wifi should be free.,8,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Chris Levin,United States,I connect at ATL quite a bit after getting used to it it works out alright. However the airport layout isn't most customer friendly. There are some 40+ gates at each terminal while when connecting to a different terminal you have to walk to the centre of the terminal to get on the train (near gate 20 or something). I had several instance where I had to go from C40 to B30 or something like that. It requires a lot of walk and run. Why don't they build one or two more train lines to make terminal-terminal travel easier? Airports like DFW have multiple train stops at different gates of any terminal much easier for connections.,6,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,S Azhar,United States,The check in kiosks at the international terminal were very confusing but someone helped. Actual check in and security was very efficient however our flight to MBJ was leaving from terminal E so we had to take the train. Lots of restaurants in terminal E (considering that so many European airlines used to come here). When we came back we came into gate E36 (the northernmost gate in terminal E). Since our final destination was ATL we had to go to a separate immigration hall in terminal F (17 min walk). If there's a new international terminal why not use it! Fortunately the line at immigration was very short and all our bags were there. Overall I think terminal F needs more gates.,7,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Linda Watkins,United States,Upon arrival at the airport from an international flight I was shocked to learn that I would have to walk a mile to retrieve my luggage and go through customs. My husband is handicapped and was ushered in a wheelchair while I was on my own to try to keep up with the young woman pushing him at breakneck speed. Often she disappeared around a corner and I had to hurry to see which way to proceed. The people movers did not work and I was exhausted and finally ended up in a wheelchair myself. The design of this new terminal is grossly flawed in that the distance from gate to baggage and customs is at least a mile and there is no good way to get there! Customs is crammed into a small area with no place to put luggage for inspection. At almost 70 years old I was not thrilled with scattering my things on the floor while everyone gawked. Surely Atlanta isn't proud of this.,1,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,J Fissore,United States,While it may not be the best airport in the world Atlanta Hartsfield is nonetheless possibly one of the best airports in the USA). It's a huge airport while some may think of this as a negative aspect Atlanta Hartsfield's simple yet effective design makes it an actually very walkable airport and going from one terminal to another is not that bad as it actually seems. The facilities and amenities are great! There is a nice offering of eateries and shops that should be able to please everyone. Finally staff are surprisingly friendly and courteous. Nevertheless Atlanta Hartsfield is quite dirty the signalling tends to be a little weak at times and the public transportation is kind of poor. All in all a great airport.,8,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,E Marsh,Canada,Just traveled to Atlanta for a week long trip. The airport is large and generally easy to find your way around but it can be crowded and loud at times. Finding a working pay phone both times I was there was impossible. The problems? In Concourse D one phone took my money twice. Another had the mouthpiece literally hanging out of the handset. Many were simply removed from the metal casings with no explanation. At baggage claim I found a payphone that allowed me to hear the other party but he could not hear me. If you have high roaming fees from your cell service or need to use a pay phone for some other reason at the Atlanta airport good luck! My flight was delayed yet I could not make the most of my time waiting due to this widespread problem.,5,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Christoph Krause,Switzerland,Atlanta International is probably the one and only international airport worldwide without car rental return. Trying to get rid of the one-way rented car (to catch an international flight) I learned that there is no rental car return at all! There is no sign or indication what to do with the car. I left the international airport and drove to the domestic - there it is. Extremely upsetting if in a hurry - since I drove by the domestic first and it is quite a distance. (I wonder what the responsible person thought of such a concept I also wonder how many people are going to experience the same adventure every day and are then too late - because of course you then need a never-ending shuttle ride back to the international terminal). Unfriendly staff at the security screaming all the time what to do and what not - instead of informing the passengers silently with signs and/or short movies.,4,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,G Ravi,United States,"Being a frequent flyer I use this airport a lot. I've used ATL as my starting destination and layover airport and would say it is designed quite well to efficiently handle massive numbers of passengers. Considering its size and passenger traffic it is very easy to change terminals for domestic connections and has a good number of shopping/eating options. The ""Plane Train"" is large fast and very frequent and the new LED/LCD display inside the train cars looks great. I've had better results using ""Plane Train"" when changing terminals than trying to walk/run. I usually try to avoid having to go through security during peak hours on Monday mornings (even priority lanes get very long). Other times aren't bad but priority lanes sure do help a lot. ""TSA pre"" is also available in South Terminal which I heard is more faster and convenient than priority lanes ( haven't personally used that yet but colleagues of mine did). Baggage is also handled quite well. Never had a lost/delayed baggage when checked in at ATL. I've noticed many new exhibits/art works being displayed around the airport (not sure if it is to encourage local artists or anything but surely beats walking past lame advertisements or promotions). Overall its a nice clean huge airport that handles itself quite well. It has its share of issues (could use better signs long lines at security at-times) but which airport doesn't.",9,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,J Krinsky,United States,The new international terminal is very nice. However the airport does not permit regional shuttles to pick up passengers at the new international terminal (they are permitted to drop off passengers). When arriving if you need to catch a regional shuttle (Groome Transportation) to another city such as Columbus Ga. or Macon Ga. you must first get on a small airport bus that takes you to ground transportation located in the domestic terminal. It is very inconvenient especially with several suitcases. I have never seen an airport with such a system. Regional shuttles should be permitted to pick up passengers at the international terminal. Also when exiting the international terminal there are no signs indicating how to get to downtown Atlanta or other areas. The signs only say I-75 North I-75 South and I-285. This is confusing. There should be big signs showing directions to downtown Atlanta Macon and Montgomery (the domestic terminal has these directions/signage).,6,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Ned Strat,United States,My biggest issue is when arriving from an international destination and terminating in ATL if you come in to an E gate you have to walk forever to be screened and pick up bags in the new F terminal. Also with the international terminal when dropping off passengers and then parking there is no place to make a u-turn to get to parking. A rather stupid over sight.,6,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,S Jones,United Kingdom,Nice new International Terminal but there is nothing here! I appreciate it's not finished but to have only takeaway options at the Food Court is not good. The price of wine and beer at the bar was blatant profiteering. To pay between $8 and $14.00 for a glass of supermarket wine and then to be served in plastic glasses is appalling. To be fair the Delta staff at check-in were lovely and the TSA staff were less surly than some I've met. Boarding was quick and efficient but I would not choose to fly to or from Atlanta in the future.,2,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,J Bunnell,United States,If you have to change planes here you feel like you're on a trek from gate to gate. There are trams available but first you have to figure out which one to take and then you have to hope that it's not full. The place is always packed because so many flights originate here (it makes no sense that flights from the midwest to points west are often routed east through Atlanta) and the signs are confusing. Very long and slow moving lines at security so plan to arrive even earlier than recommended by the airlines. Also it may just be our bad luck but every time we have had to change planes there the gates are changed at the last minute requiring a sprint from point A to point B. I can completely understand why there are so many complaints about missed connections here. The one saving grace is that our luggage has never been lost at this airport. We have learned that even if it means extra cost to avoid flights requiring the use of Hartsfield if at all possible.,2,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,J Bachenberg,United States,"This is my home airport and since I'm familiar with it I probably find it less annoying that some. My husband and I recently took a trip to Europe. We left out of the old international terminal Terminal E. No real problems. We had checked in prior to our flight so we got the short check in line at Lufthansa. Security went quickly. Hopped on the train out to the terminal. We returned into the new international terminal. It had been open about a week and obviously the ""bugs"" hadn't been worked out yet. Our flight landed an hour early which caused me concern. We got through customs in a reasonable amount of time. We went to pick up our luggage - it took over an hour. Good thing the plane was early. The luggage dribbled onto the carrousel at the rate of about 2 bags every 5 minutes. As we walked out to the departure lobby we saw an area immediately to our left marked for limo drivers. No one there with our name. When we were dropped off the driver didn't have a card so I needed to find the limo service's phone number. Walked to the information desk in the lobby asked for a phone book so that I could call the limo service. She didn't have one. Asked if she could look up the phone number on the PC sitting in front of her. She gave some excuse about it didn't always work right. Finally gave me a number that was wrong. Atlanta if you want to be a true international city you need to get your airport in order.",7,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,D Brin,United States,"Atlanta is very illogical. Coupled with Delta's copious delays and cancellations make sure to have a lot of time for a layover there. My flight was listed on the screens as ""At Gate"" but it didn't have the gate number! Needless to say that's not the thing you want to see. After asking a pretty unhappy info desk lady I found out it was at the end of terminal E at that time the int'l terminal. The walks are long and you have to ride trains and sometimes buses.",7,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,J Krinsky,United States,This concerns the recently opened international terminal. First there is only one place to eat in the departure level outside the security check point. It is rather small and often crowded. Second the customs area is too small to handle all incoming flights. Customs officials are rude and bark orders to arriving passengers. Third to catch MARTA or regional shuttles you have to get on a shuttle bus to go to the domestic terminal and ground transportation. That means lugging your heavy luggage onto a shuttle bus. The domestic terminal was much more convenient and offers more services. The only advantage of the new international terminal is that passengers do not have to recheck their luggage and go through security before exiting the airport. Very poorly planned international terminal.,7,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Jane Powell,United Kingdom,After travelling through most of the world's large airports in the past 20 years Atlanta is by far the worst. The signage is diabolical the staff surly and don't even get me started on the illogicality of screening passengers and baggage after they've landed - you need to allow another 2-3 hours just to get out of the airport!,1,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Mark Simons,United Kingdom,Flew in to the new Maynard International terminal. Staff at customs seemed to be surprised an international flight had arrived. Only 4 customs officers on duty and very surly people then shouting at you to clear the area even if you were just waiting for friends or family to come through. On the journey back you see the new terminal facility and whilst gate areas are spacious the facilities are very poor. There is a fast food court and a few shops and that's it. There was far more catering available in the domestic piers. Considering this must be a showcase terminal for international travel to not even have a restaurant or bar where you could sit down is ridiculous the domestic piers are also notable for the number of passengers desperately running to catch connecting flights - it almost looks like a sport!,4,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Louise Hammerl,United States,Even when you are on the same airline connecting to another flight there is a good chance you will miss the flight. This is mainly because the gates are so far away and very often depart from a completely different terminal. If you have less than 45 minutes to get to another terminal another gate you probably won't make it! Be prepared to push through people and run a marathon. I only fly through Atlanta when I have no other choice. I would rather drive than go through Atlanta airport.,2,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,T Storm,Sweden,This is the worst and most illogical US airport! To exit from the international terminal you have to pass through security a 2nd time! You need a minimum 3 hours from arrival to the next international flight - unacceptable!,2,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Richard Hsu,Canada,Took almost 2 hours to get through immigration. There were 2 immigration officials working. I was in transit and missed my connecting flight because of this along with everyone around us. Unless you have 5 hours between connecting flights beware!,2,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Paul Rofe,Netherlands,Slow immigration bad attitude staff members tough to find a Delta person to help you hot crowded restaurants and that amazing double security check to leave the airport from the E gates. Let's hope the new terminal solves these issues. (I use the airport a lot by the way so this is definitely not a one-off complaint).,3,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Coretta Van Leer,Netherlands,We fly to the USA once a year and arrival at Atlanta Hartsfield has been the worst arrival ever. After two flights and a long wait in between we arrived at our destination only to find out we need to be checked again shoes off x-ray the works. On top of that staff are incredibly rude. Avoid Hartsfield if you can.,1,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,A Helfrish,United States,ATL is a nice airport clean and many shopping/eating options. But if you're at a far end gate and have to transfer terminals its a long walk.,8,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,B Tromp,Netherlands,A reasonable airport. At times a little difficult because of the many signs in the terminal especially on arrival. The only problem I have with this airport is that you go through a lot of check points and at the end your baggage goes to a carousel in the main terminal. Everyone has access to that carousel. Its very easy for someone to steal your baggage if you don't go get it directly. There is no control of people.,9,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,J Krinsky,United States,In my opinion ATL is a very efficient airport considering the amount of passengers served. ATL is easy to navigate and you do not have to go outside to change terminals. The down side of this airport is international arrivals as you are required to recheck and claim your luggage and go through a security checkpoint before exiting the airport. However this will change in a few months when the new international terminal opens. If your final destination is Atlanta you will exit the airport after clearing customs no more security checks and rechecking of luggage. ATL does have its faults (rude TSA long lines at security) but what airport does not.,9,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,D Dean,Guam,Atlanta is growing on me. I would hate to have to herd my family through Atlanta but it is quite well designed in handling the massive crowds that flow through the busiest airport in the US. Arriving international will remain a nightmare that needs attention but this time I only had 4 domestic connections and they seemed no worse than anywhere else I have been. Overall Atlanta is crowded with lots of people but really does move them around fairly efficiently.,8,1
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,M Klausalski,Germany,Arrived from Munich Germany. At first it looked like we were the only plane arriving besides the people on my plane there was only 20-30 others walking around - trying to find where to go. I followed the crowd to a huge area of counters. There must have been at least 25 on one side. There were no signs indicating which lines to go to there was 30 people with about 6 counters open so I thought it didn't really matter as there was no lines of people waiting. I handed the TSA officer my passport at the counter who asked me why I was in this line when I should be in the other one. He mumbled something and waved his hand. ATL is uncoordinated unfriendly and unhelpful a maze with no signs.,1,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,R O'Connor,United States,Great Airport. It's really clean and there is enough sitting room. I love the large array of shops and places to eat. I imagine it can probably be confusing for someone going through it for the first time. I do not like how you have to pay for wi-fi. There are enough plugs for everyone which is really nice. Overall great airport.,5,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,James Jones,United Kingdom,It seems the security debacle has not improved looking at previous comments. I arrived in Atlanta from the UK with 1hr 30mins between my connecting flight. I stood in Immigration (along with about 500+ other foreign nationals) for 1 hour 15 mins as there was the grand total of 3 immigrations officials to cater for all these people. The aircon was broken the Shuttle train wasn't working and although I'm fairly fit I could not run the 1 mile to the other terminal in time for my flight! I missed my flight and was put on another one leaving an hour later.,1,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,David Stein,United States,I connected through Hartsfield to and from Guatemala. Transfers went very smoothly. I was especially impressed that I was able to get through passport control customs check my bag  through security getting to my connecting gate in 45 minutes.,4,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Brian Smith,Japan,Overall not a bad experience. Depending on the load at any particular concourse it can feel crowded and cramped. Generally the passenger facilities are decent. Delta has introduced more power stations in gate areas and that has to be a good thing. Hold on tight in the people mover it starts and stops abruptly.,4,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,R Muratovic,United States,I have connected a few times in ATL in the AirTran Terminal. I must say this terminal has a great variety of restaurants and bars. It even has a smoking section. Connecting times are very short with AirTran.,5,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,J Sabaduquia,United States,Connected at ATL on Delta. We arrived at Concourse B transfer using the tram was fast. Concourse E had a lot of shops good design of the airport although the gate area had a lot of seating. Return flight from CUN we had to go through customs and it the best immigration experience I've had - only one flight so that helps. Food court on Concourse B was great excellent views of the apron and traffic gate area was a bit small. Overall I was impressed with this airport considering it's huge traffic and size it is organized and well ran and friendly staff.,5,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Chris Musson,United Kingdom,I agree with an earlier reviewer. The return flight out of Atlanta was smooth few queues and comfortable sized gates with lots of amenities. Really very slick. By contrast the arrival is baffling despite the Delta flight trying to explain the inexplicable before landing. In short you clear immigration (I had no problems) and you reclaim your bag from security. This would normally be it. However you need to go through the usual outward bound security checks (shoes/belts etc) all over again. Before you can do that you need to pop your case on a carousel which the sign says will arrive at a similar carousel in the Terminal South/North building. So half an hour for the security check down to the shuttle train which loops round the 5 main buildings and the final Terminal/exit before picking up the bag. I have every sympathy with those who had to wait for their bags although I was just as concerned that anyone could have walked off with them. Not a good way for the city to introduce itself although it seemed to work (just),3,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,John Doe,United States,"This airport has it's good and it's bad points. From the point of view of arriving at this airport it is mediocre at best. Once off the plane you frantically search for the baggage claim signs. This could be improved upon greatly. Once getting downstairs to the shuttles between concourses you are rushed to the baggage claim efficiently. The rental car facilities are well maintained and usually staffed. Leaving the rental car facility is simple then you enter and head directly into the hell that is baggage check-in. If you are fortunate carry-on you are in luck not much waiting. Typically we travel with odd engineering tools which can be a hassel to explain to TSA ""agents"" who apparently moonlight as Walmart employees. So a carry-on is usually in favor. When you approach the desk and I've only struggled with Delta check-in agents are often discourteous. Many stand around under signs which indicate that terminal is open and when you approach them they are quick to inform you to choose another line. The lines are long because only one person usually checks bags per every 25 people standing in line. Once through this heading for security is simple. There are many places to chop and eat both inside and outside security. The frustration here is their ""expert traveler"" security point. Located at the end of the hall quite often you get stragglers who miss the main security gate. I have no problem spending a few minutes in security if means I get home safely. My frustration is with those who are completely unprepared and think the world has to wait on them. Once through heading to your gate is simple - at the gate the shops and eateries throughout the concourses. But there isn't enough seating in the gate area for those on each plane. Often crowds and lines form into the main aisle putting you harms way of being run over with impatient shuttle (golf cart) drivers chauffeuring loads of elderly and morbidly obese people. Grab something to eat if there's room and if you have time to stand in line. Do some shopping or find a seat four gates away. People watching is always a good way to pass the time.",3,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Jim Henderson,Australia,What a terrible airport I have never seen such a stupid setup in all my life. After arriving from London on a delta flight we thought we were free of the US security apparatus but no! Post customs we walked into an abusive storm from airport and security officials complaining that we had not bothered to read the signs. Despite not knowing what was going on (there are no signs explaining this ridiculously stupid process) our bags were ripped from us and we were shoved into a long TSA security line. No one else does this so who were we to know. After clearing security and picking our way through an airport that has multiple signs in the terminal for existing (all pointing in several different directions including the wrong direction) we were forced to wait 2 hours for our bags to re-appear. I note that we were greeted with the option of picking from 3 carousels in a luggage lucky dip. 15 International flights and 3 carousels - 3 hours after arriving we were free.,1,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,A Matthews,United Kingdom,Taking into account that Atlanta is one of the most crowded airports in the world I think it does a great job. I am an American that works out of the country so I spend a fair amount of time going through customs everywhere. While Atlanta's could certainly be improved it is not as bad as many places. Once the new international terminal opens it will further help alleviate the current headache. The rest of the offerings in Atlanta are great however if you aren't flying Delta or Airtran I can see there could be some difficulties with gate changes.,5,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Terence Lewis,United Kingdom,In my long experience of travelling from the UK to the US Atlanta is the worst most inconvenient airport to arrive at. The whole business of having to recheck you luggage after picking it up is a farce. What makes it worse is that if you have any duty free alcohol in your carry on luggage it has to be transferred to you checked luggage at this point - only the floor is available to do this transfer! Then you have to go through aggressive security checks with your hand luggage - even though you have just come off of an international flight where you have been thoroughly checked. Is this because US officials do not trust 'foreign' security(?) - even though London is distinctly more thorough than when you leave Atlanta (eg. where were the checks on liquids carried onto planes?). When you finally get your luggage in the terminal you now have to haul it up onto another train to reach the rental car desks - it took us an unacceptable 2 hours from landing to reach this point. I suspect that the basic problem with the airport is that it was never designed to cater for international passengers - which it doesn't.,1,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,David Brown,United Kingdom,This is a crazy airport departing out of Atlanta was fine but arriving from overseas was ridiculous. Once you have waited for an age at immigration and then waited for your baggage you start to think you are home free but no. The signage and information is very poor and before you know it you have security personnel shouting at you as they take your checked baggage off you and it disappears. Then for you it's shoes off x ray the full routine as they do another full security screening. Then it's on a train that takes for ever to get back to the main terminal and another wait for your bags to appear. But don't believe the carousel number it's a lucky dip at this stage. We arrived on a Thursday afternoon at 3pm from Europe. It took 2 and half hours before we got out of the terminal. We shall avoid in the future.,3,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,M Streit,United States,We have used ATL for a dozen years or so flying Delta to international destinations as well as to the East coast. The operation works quite well. We have found ATL Immigration to be efficient and our luggage is delivered to us promptly; security rescreening back into the US at ATL can get crowded but we've found that it moves along and gets us to our connection in a timely fashion. The international terminal is great. Many shops and restaurant options; duty free shopping has everything you need. The trains between terminals are quick and efficient.,5,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Brian Massey,United Kingdom,The only airport that security screens you after you land. Shoes off x ray the full routine and forces you to wait for your bags twice. Once from the plane and then a second time at the terminal. All liquids are confiscated as you pass through security to get into the country. This includes duty free - perfume alcohol and shower gel. What do the authorities think you can do with these items since they are freely available in the terminal. It's blatant job protection for the sake of pointless tasks. The final issue is that the baggage claim is in a public area so anyone can walk in off the airport and pick up bags that don't belong to them.,1,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,S Koenig,Brazil,Big and seemingly always crowded but with lots of facilities including many many shops and eateries. We were fortunate enough to be traveling international Business Class so got free use of the Delta Sky Clubs. There are several in the airport but only the one in Terminal E (I believe) has showers and there are only two so there can be a wait. The train between terminals can get crowded but they are frequent. Lines for Immigration moved quickly though they didn't open until 5:30 a.m. so when our flight from Brazil arrived early (about 5:15) we had to wait on the plane until 5:30 until we could even disembark (and then there was the long walk to actually get to Immigration). On our return (again for a connection) we could not find our flight leaving 2 hours later on the departures board and the agent at the airline customer service desk said that sometimes flights don't make it onto all boards at the same time.,4,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,L Enticknap,United Kingdom,Arrival and transfer on July 2 - no queue for immigration.! I was ushered straight up and the immigration officer was polite and welcoming. However that very positive start was then offset slightly by a 30-minute wait for my suitcase to arrive on the carousel. You've got to faff about with a tube train getting between terminals - it's not all under one roof like Minneapolis or Memphis is - but with a four hour transfer window that was no problem. The range of eateries and shops was all pretty much what you'd expect. The only downside I'd flag up with ATL as a transfer airport is the absence of free wi-fi.,4,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,B Coe,United States,We will avoid using this airport on future trips. They continuously move your departure gate and may or may not notify the passengers. Then when you are late because you did not know they take no responsibility for it. We ran all over that place due to constant changes. It is very poorly run although I have to say the staff are friendly and helpful for the most part. We missed our connecting flight because they changed the gate and we did not know and then they left early. We were however put on standby for the next flight 2 hrs later and got on it. We saw this happen to others when we were returning home and spoke to a lot of people who had the same frustrating experience. I felt the problem was totally the airport and others said they always have problems with Delta.,1,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Glenn Barnes,United Kingdom,The security process from arriving off an international flight is the worse I have ever used or seen. It took 45 minutes to clear security then another 30 minutes for the baggage to be transferred to arrivals. I will never use this airport again if I can avoid it.,1,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Rich Jenkins,United States,"ATL's major function is providing domestic connections for Delta passengers and it does this fairly well with an efficient train system between concourses. OTOH the concourses are long and Delta customer service (such as it is) has been greatly cut back. Earlier this year I encountered a situation where the wrong type of aircraft had been provided (after a long delay and cancellation of flights before and after ours) and the ticket staff were less than gracious in dealing with the fallout. The food selection remains relatively unhealthy and the largest food court (outside of the main terminal) tends to be crowded. The selection of reading material is generally pretty awful but typical of Atlanta in general. CNN is loud and inescapable and the airport generally provides even less opportunity for peace and quiet than the average. Departure security is centralized and unpredictable but not quite as timeconsuming as it was 2-3 years ago. The ""secret"" North terminal alternative to the main terminal security has been closed--this had provided much faster screening because it was known only to people using the T terminal and carriers other than Delta. Baggage areas have been remodeled but there no longer is security to check tags. Beware of taxi operators who approach you in the baggage claim as they charge more than the ones in the queue outside. Expect taxi drivers to not know anything other than major hotels - bring mapquest-type directions to your destination. Long time Atlantans don't know much of the area either. Marta rapid transit service has gotten slightly better although the process of paying for fares with cards is cumbersome compared with the old token system. Marta is the best way to reach major hotels downtown in Midtown and Buckhead. Customer service is generally horrible in the airport although better with carriers other than Delta. Despite many years of living in ATL and much international travel I always cleared customs elsewhere (my int'l travel was mostly to Asia and on United so ATL was rarely feasible) my understanding is that international arrivals are variable and often unpleasant. The international terminal which used to be dismal is apparently being redone. Delays are common at this airport - the weather in the Atlanta area is volatile with downpours and thunder storms being quite common in Spring and summer plus Atlanta gets the back end of hurricanes in the fall. Often things will seem mild or only drizzly at the airport but will be violent somewhere in an nearby flight path and this will cause delays. Some delays occur because of problems elsewhere in an airline's hub/spoke system and this is particularly true of Delta which dominates the airport. Morning departures are more predictable and less prone to delay than afternoon or evening flights.",2,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,E Jensen,United States,I was wondering if what I experienced was a one of a kind or a bad day. Apparently not. In Atlanta US Immigration Officials just get up and walk away when there are huge lines and don't come back for a long time and say nothing. One official yelled at a passenger for standing in line the wrong way and pointed at her like she was a dog. After about 200 people deep in line they finally opened some more windows to move us through. Then there is the re- screening to get out of the airport. I was screened three times to get on the plane and now I have to go to get Xrayed when I am getting ready to go home. The random selection is also pathetic.,2,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Melissa Pace,Malta,Arrived after a 12 hour flight from Malta/London feeling nauseous and not that good. Little did we realise that it would take another 2 hours to get out of the airport! The usual interrogation at immigration then the inexplicable procedure of collecting your baggage only to have it taken away again with no explanation of how to collect it. Then another 45 minutes standing in line to go through security just to leave the airport. Can someone please explain why this is necessary as no-one seemed to have a good explanation as to why we had to suffer this ordeal. Then we were directed to a tube-train crammed with people and when we eventually arrived at the baggage reclaim there was our daughter and son-in-law (who live in the States and had come to meet us) standing with all our bags which they had collected for us!!! Some security - anyone could have walked off with it. I will never go there again - it was a nightmare and I still see no reason for it.,2,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Alex Greig,United Kingdom,What a nightmare place! Immigration officials who suddenly leave their desks to go on a break without a word leaving a bewildered queue. Your luggage snatched away from you within seconds of retrieving it without any clear idea given of where or when you will ever see it again. Having to go through full security just to get out of the airport. Officials barking orders left right and centre. Never again if I can help it.,1,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Richard Martin,United States,I have traveled through many airports over the years and employees of Hartsfield Airport are the rudest I have seen. They act as if they hate their jobs and bark orders at people. Customer service is not part of the job skill. It's a shame because the rest of the south have warm and welcoming people with great attitudes. I would not recommend going through this airport unless there is no other choice.,3,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Jorg Ludewig,Germany,Went thru Atlanta from Frankfurt to San Diego. Customs was empty thus pretty fast though the USA treats its visitors like potential threats. Hand screen iris screen what is next? Footprints? Getting the checked in luggage took quite a while checking back was fast. Only downpart is the security check right after. Did not we just got off a plane? Anyway all facilities decent ground transportation is efficient and layover can be rather short without being afraid to miss connection.,4,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,J Leong,United Kingdom,Southern hospitality it was not at Atlanta Jackson-Hartsfield airport! Upon arrival from Amsterdam we reclaimed our baggage - and then told we had to queue and go through security again Plus we had our baggage screened and taken away from us  to be reclaimed a second time around! What was the point? Were they afraid that passengers who got off after a safe flight might hijack the bus or something? I am all for security but this was craziness banking on paranoia. As far as I know no other US international airport does that. The staff at security and customs were also rude and unwelcoming shouting and ordering at passengers like badly-trained prison officers. I will avoid Atlanta Jackson-Hartsfield like the plague. The airport does not know how to make visitors feel welcome.,1,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,L Drabik,United States,I have used this airport for over 20 years to catch connecting flights to PA. Only once did I use it for outbound international travel so have not experienced the inbound international travel situation as described by others (I re-entered the US via EWR). I have always encountered courteous employees throughout the airport and I think the layout of the airport was well-planned I especially like the subway that connects the terminal and all the concourses together. And I really like how you can go from concourse to concourse withOUT having to go through security again like I experienced at a major European airport. Also I like the many dining options available in every concourse. Rarely have I experienced any flight delays as I normally fly in the early morning hours to avoid any weather-related issues like those that usually occur in summer afternoons! Last month I chose to travel in the afternoon and sure enough our inbound flight was put into a holding pattern for approx. 15 mins and the outbound flight sat at the gate for 20 mins before backing out due to the local weather situation. Now with all that said the only real drawback I can find is the lack of moving sidewalks in the concourses. I do realize there are moving sidewalks parallel to the subway line but I think with the length of the concourses moving sidewalks would have been included as well!,4,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Bill Atkins,,Atlanta is one of the rare airports where someone seems to keep evaluating how to make things better for travellers. It is very crowded sometimes and seating in the Food Court pre-security can be short at peak times. However the whole check-in/security/transportation deal is well- organized and most people involved are polite and friendly.,4,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Ralf Klein,,Considered that ATL is a very large and busy airport I think it is amazing how fast one actually gets through immigration baggage claim customs baggage recheck and security screening. I really appreciated that the last few times I used ATL as a port-of-entry when travelling to the US. I also like the airport lounges in Concourse E and the food court. Another plus is the quick train connecting all concourses.,4,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,M Steinfeld,,Hartsfield seems to be kind of a hit-or-miss deal. If you're connecting leave plenty of time (don't take a 30-45min layover because it won't be enough if things start going wrong). When arriving/ departing from Atlanta (ie. not connecting through) I have never had a problem. Sometimes it takes bags a while to display in the terminal but other than that the ground is usually as efficient as possible. However for connecting flights the major issue seems to be weather. On a good-weather day I never have problems. But once bad weather hits everything starts to break down. Delta has always been good to me if I needed to rebook but again all we can do as passengers is to give ourselves a decent layover time to account for the possible delay. Overall the facilities are pretty good compared to other US airports. Especially Terminal E. There's plenty of food options as well as decent shopping. The airport staff is usually extremely nice and always helpful - just be polite. But as with all airports I've found that those passengers who plan ahead and know what to do if there's an unexpected delay etc. are the same people that are least impacted by that delay.,4,0
auckland-airport,David Killick,New Zealand,Domestic terminal is lacklustre and basic. Follow the signs (not bad but could be clearer one woman scared walking through dark parking lot) to get to the International Terminal about a 10-minute walk. We had already checked in for international flight at Christchurch so went straight to Customs and security. Smart Gate for Kiwis is easy no wait at security. Shopping is OK but nothing special. NZ duty free alcohol is good value though. We had one voucher for the Koru Lounge and paid for one extra entry (about NZD56). Not worth it. Much better on previous occasions. Pasta overcooked. Main meals on counter disappeared and replaced with sandwiches. We flew out of Auckland because we had a premium economy booking on Air NZ (not available out of Christchurch). Next time we'll fly direct.,7,1
auckland-airport,P Dunlop,New Zealand,Having travelled through this airport on average 2-3 times a month for the past 20 years it surprised me to see such a variations in opinions of Auckland Airport. I must add a proviso in that I fly mainly business class with Air NZ ( NZ ) or Singapore Airlines (SQ). At check in Air NZ has a premium desk which works well as does SQ. SQ use the NZ lounge. After check in the outward immigration is automatic for NZ / Australian / UK and US citizens who have a passport with a chip. The security system is efficient and the staff friendly. I would say my longest wait in a queue has been 5 minutes. On arrival the same immigration system is in place if you are on a passport that is not as listed above immigration is manual. I have arrived at different times during the day and my observation of the queues at the manual counters is that they are far smaller than Australia / UK / US etc. If you have checked in baggage it seems to arrive quite quickly  I would say my longest waiting time has been 10-15 minutes but that is probably because I am off the plane quickly and have no delays at immigration. The aspect that does need to be streamlined is the quarantine / agriculture inspection (New Zealand is a country based on agriculture and there is a paranoia regarding importation of foods etc. that may contain foreign insects etc.) The queues can be up to 10 minutes and the area needs more staff / desks particularly during busy periods. If the quarantine inspector grants you a free pass you by - pass any x rays etc. and are out the door quickly. Overall I find Auckland quite efficient both departing and arriving but would like to see some streamlining of the quarantine procedures without compromising the purpose behind this screening on arrival.,9,1
auckland-airport,M Banjo,United Kingdom,I have been travelling to New Zealand for almost 35 years now but in the past 10 years trying to get through Customs has been horrendous the last time I was unfortunate enough to use it it took me 2 hours after getting through passport control to get through the immigration/customs I just could not believe the queue when I arrived it was snaking around the luggage pick up hall. There are usually queues but this beat them all and there shouldn't be any excuses about the Aussie fruit fly slowing things down. Our plane was sprayed as soon as it touched down it took no more then 10 minutes. What I have always noticed is there are never enough immigration/ customs officers working.,1,0
auckland-airport,J Laquerre,Canada,It is a bit confusing from International to Domestic but do-able. Everyone at this airport looks as if they trying their best to make it a good experience and do what is in their power to help. Entering the country is complicated because they have to protect their very precious environment from other countries virus and so on. I respect that - after all they have a lot to lose as NZ is a unique environment and we are not flying between US states so this has to be considered. They do the right thing to protect their environment and it is worth the wait to know they are protecting their country.,8,1
auckland-airport,Jim Marchant,Canada,Worst Airport arrival procedures in 30 years of flying. It took 100 minutes to clear customs and immigration on December 1st 2014. Unbelievably inefficient procedures with half the immigration booths unmanned. One long line for immigration then another separate long line for customs followed by yet a third line for X-Ray scanning of the incoming bags. No official could explain the purpose of the third step. Many of my fellow passengers missed their connecting flights as a result of these unbelievable series of procedures. Avoid Auckland airport for entering New Zealand.,,0
auckland-airport,Sue Taylor,New Zealand,It seems on the surface to have quite a few shops both before going through immigration and after. But on closer inspection they are pretty much the same shops repeated over and over. There are definitely a lot of food options but in my opinion the better range of options is before going through immigration. I had the opportunity to have to spend far too much time at the airport when travelling to Fiji and you really notice things. It is fine if you only have an hour or two to kill but if because you have to wait for ages because you live outside of Auckland you have 5 or 6 hours to kill not so great. The lesson learned try no to be at the airport any longer than you have to.,7,1
auckland-airport,Jenny Appleton,New Zealand,I just read a damning review on Auckland airport comparing it to LA. I've only been in LA for transfer and it was a few years ago but I have said never again. It is small enough to find your way around and big enough to have everything you need. Auckland airport greets you on arrival with beautiful Maori music as you walk through a huge carved entrance-way. The corridors are lined with lovely photos of NZ life. Sure you enter though duty-free but it's easy to ignore. The airport is spotless. The best bit though is the friendly staff even at immigration. I am sure that Singapore and Bangkok are bigger and better but for a medium sized airport the only fault that I can find is the lack of wi-fi.,10,1
auckland-airport,G Rountree,New Zealand,I have travelled quite extensively. The Air NZ check in at Mangere is probably the worst I have experienced! There was no procedure - suitcases trolleys people nobody knew where to queue elderly people had no clue on how to get their boarding pass and 4 assistants to help the masses. This area definitely needs looking at. Bring back the old way!,8,1
auckland-airport,Kevin Phillips,New Zealand,Arrived from Honolulu at 7.10am on 2nd March to find the immigration line very long. I was in the NZ passport/resident line. Even though the line was long there was only One immigration officer on duty unbelievable. I have never experienced this at AKL in the past always very efficient. As it happened I missed my connection flight.,,0
auckland-airport,Alex Tai,New Zealand,By far the best airport in the region. Check in area was great and did not look dated (International Terminal). Upstairs there was a lot of options in the food court and duty free. In the customs/immigration the backlog was cleared super-fast and into the departures area which looked stunning. To the far end you could see planes take off and land and slightly to the left after immigration is a entire aisle of duty free. Forex trading were everywhere. Easy to find a seat and my gate (gate 2) was just around the corner. If you walk a little further there was a gate where you can call (NZ only) back to your home for free. No doubt I'd be happy to use this airport again.,10,1
auckland-airport,D Mil,New Zealand,So impressed with how fast from gate to out of the airport. Friendly customs staff bags always available quickly.,10,1
auckland-airport,A Bukh,Japan,Overall Auckland airport is quite compact and convenient. Smoking area in the international terminal is a big plus though it is closed from 9pm till about 5 am. The toilets are generally clean but scarce. The biggest downside however is that the airport has recently changed the world wide accepted policy of providing free airport shuttle to nearby airport hotels and now charges 6$ per person for the shuttles that come once in half an hour. So even if you are staying at Ibis hotel which is about 10 minutes walk from the terminal but can't walk because you have bags or its raining you need to pay 6$ per person to get to the already overpriced hotel. A taxi will charge you 20$ for the 2-3 minutes ride. I am not sure whether the latter is resulting from airport policy but I find this to be a total rip off.,5,0
auckland-airport,Sally Davis,United Kingdom,Departing AKL for DXB/GLA 11 November 2013. A quiet day hence prompt queues for the outgoing security & passport control (ie. through in about five minutes). Allow ten minutes to get to the Pier B gates if you are on an EK flight. Food & beverage options landside could be better.,9,1
auckland-airport,Sally Davis,Australia,Auckland Airport was very clean comfortable and safe! There was limited shopping and food available but more than satisfactory for a short stop over.,8,1
auckland-airport,Deborah Newman,New Zealand,"My sister and I had arrived from Melbourne on EK406 at 1.20pm we were travelling with 10 month old twins the first thing she asked the flight attendants was whether there were any strollers for the babies the reply ""none"". I had complained to a member of staff the reply was travelers bring their own strollers does he know they get taken away at the boarding gate? Two ground staff members came past dragging three wheel chairs between them I asked where the strollers were for the babies the reply ""This is the only Airport that don't have any"". There were strollers at Melbourne's arrival gate.",,0
auckland-airport,Ross Clark,United Kingdom,Arriving off EK from DXB-MEL. It is fortunate that the flight was late because its arrival at the same time as EK's other two A380s would give Auckland some fearsome problems. Apart from the puzzle of two separate duty-free stores charging near-identical prices I quite liked it: the EGates worked fine not too long to wait for baggage (but only because the other EK flights were on time) and the customs/agricultural processing has been sharpened up by getting only a proportion of passengers' baggage through the X-ray machines and waving through the balance. The bus to the city works well but at $NZD28 return is a bit expensive.,8,1
auckland-airport,D Nicklin,United States,"Freeinternet access. After connecting several minutes of hang time for terms and conditions to open. After accepting 30 minutes of access several minutes more hang time before page opens saying you can use the internet. But connection is so poor even basic web portal pages won't open. So functionally no internet access but the pretence of access which wastes 20 minutes of traveler time while they mess around with it. Also no power stations or work areas to plug in the computer. Clearly working on the internet while waiting for your international flight is not part of the package/expectation at Auckland International. I have been in a half dozen international airports (Phila San Fran Sydney Numea Rome). Auckland is years behind all of them. The signs around the airport touting ""highest rating"" are actually funny in an ironic way.",,0
auckland-airport,J Williams,Australia,Domestic. Unimpressed with Air NZ self check-in process after international flight arrival. Even had to lift own bags onto the carousel which I'm barely physically capable of doing. A middle aged female solitary attendant waved me toward the bag carousel like a traffic cop but clearly did not intend to assist with the physical transfer. Will check out Virgin on next visit but unfortunately smaller regional airports are captive to Air NZ. On international side the service was marginally better.,6,1
auckland-airport,Wendy R London,New Zealand,Comments apply only to the Domestic Transfer desk at AKL - the rest of the operation at AKL is excellent. My husband and I arrived at AKL on EK 406 (First Class) on 8 August and once we cleared customs with our luggage went to the transfer desk to check-in and leave our luggage for our domestic connection NZ 445 to WEL. There was one family group of 4 ahead of us and one person at the check-in desk (a second one soon arrived). The desk agent refused to check us in telling us that we had to use one of the two check-in kiosks. At the time the family were attempting to use both kiosks and were having trouble the desk agent still refused to manually check us in saying that if that family could do it so could we. The desk agent still refused to help despite the fact that even by then there was no one else in the queue. My concerns are: There are only 2 kiosks and their position â€“ make it very difficult for more than one or two people to queue up to use it. Unlike the domestic terminal there are no staff members positioned near the kiosks to help. My great fear is the congestion which would occur if the remaining pax from our A380 had reached the transfer desk at that time or indeed if more than one aircraft landed at the same time producing more transfer pax. Upon arriving at AKL we had just flown 15 hours not including our MEL lay-over. Frankly we were too tired to have to deal with horrifically sub-standard customer service. This complaint is not about being a premium pax or a non-premium pax. It is about a serious lack of customer service for all passengers transferring at our major gateway airport.,9,1
auckland-airport,T Collier,United Kingdom,Flew in/out of this airport 4 times during our recent holiday so feel I can comment fully on all aspects of this airport. Very long walks from the gates to immigration and through the large duty free store too. Immigration was a joke - 2 officers on for the rush of flights first thing in the morning for non-NZ/Aus 1 for the afternoon rush! 30 mins free wifi daily once you fill in online forms. Immigration/security on way out much better. Long walk again to plane gates. Not much seating with gates. Food court pre-security like one big scrum trying to get a seat. Needs modernising/refurbishment to make it clean and user friendly.,3,0
auckland-airport,Simon Gilmore,New Zealand,Passed through Auckland Airport to and from Apia last week. I have smart passport so it was a breeze to and from immigration wise. On the way out I used the men's toilet next to the Relay bookshop they were disgusting. Not entirely the airports fault but their cleaners should be checking more carefully. Also airside the whole terminal looked as if it could do with a good clean.,7,1
auckland-airport,R Liebig,New Zealand,In general this airport is not so bad however feel that over the pas few years they have invested heavily in nice shops however not enough into the actual infrastructure such as double Aerobridges at the gates to unload and load passengers faster on wide body aircraft which at times takes long time to embark or disembark from. Also the majority of the gate lounges are run down with old seating and carpet with the actual Aerobridges in a not much better state. Also the check in hall needs a major overhaul to modernize it and get rid of the ugly vinyl flooring and arrival baggage claim is still way too small in order to handle extra capacity in peak times meaning waiting for you baggage a long time. All in all the airport really has a lot of work to do in a lot places when it comes making it more modern and in line with the rest of the upgrades done in previous years.,5,1
auckland-airport,Simon Gilmore,New Zealand,This airport is purely and simply a cash cow. The casual parking rates are simply outrageous. The airport company obviously does not want the public to linger in the terminal. But if you do want to linger it has all the ambience of a super large McDonald's. Not a public minded airport in any way.,,0
auckland-airport,Steve Wood,Australia,Upon traveling in and out of Auckland International airport recently we found the following disasters: Toilets were filthy flushing systems not working some mens toilets closed off. Food preferences at 7.00 am were poor with no cooked breakfasts available at all only cold sandwiches or muffins and coffee although the bar was open for alcoholic drinks! Electronic passport processing was not working properly with some machines sign posted as 'Not Working' No electronic processing at all through customs clearance upon departure. Poor assistance from airport staff in respect of electronic passport issues. Staff being too few and difficult to identify and mostly talking one another referring me to other machines (I tried 4 unsuccessfully) or to other staff members. A total lack of warmth from mostly foreign staff with poor English language or Kiwi culture knowledge. I felt like a foreigner in my home town. Lastly I resented being hindered by foreign Duty Free shopping staff as I moved through to Customs. Overall a poor International airport experience and a poor reflection of the real New Zealand culture.,,0
auckland-airport,M Sullman,United Kingdom,Very modern clean and efficient airport. The sounds and the setting are a lovely way to enter NZ. A far cry from the sterile dilapidated interiors we are used to in the UK. Passing through security was a breeze and the staff very helpful and friendly.,10,1
auckland-airport,James Smith,New Zealand,Airport is generally good staff are friendly and for a small airport the facilities are excellent. Only gripe is the queue at immigration on the way in - one person at the desk and a 40 minute wait really isn't good enough.,7,1
auckland-airport,H Beasor,United States,Arrived from SYD. Everything was fine until the Immigration line. The lines were amazingly long and it appears there were only 3 officers working. After immigration / customs was able to acquire the rental car and out of the parking lot within 20 minutes.,8,1
auckland-airport,Ed Roggeveen,New Zealand,What an extraordinary range of reviews for this airport and I guess it reflects different times / dates and expectations. I use it fairly regularly - admittedly mostly going to and from Aus and have found it very good (far superior to Sydney). I agree with the comments about the pushy Duty Free salesman but overall I always find going in and out either alone or with my infant son very easy. On a recent arrival I mentioned the pushchair had been on the beach and in the forest in North Queensland and they happily took it away and cleaned the wheels thoroughly - great service! Enough food options - how many do you need? And with one exception I have found all customs immigration staff very helpful and friendly.,9,1
auckland-airport,Indranil Chakrabarty,Australia,The airport is now contemporary and modern with excellent shopping. Staff are friendly but obtrusive and most surprisingly many don't know what they are talking about. So double check. I was assured a window seat on TG but was seated smack bang in the middle. The girl at the curio shop asked how I sneaked through with a duty free bag. Strange. Small and cosy airport that mostly serves the Pacific islands. It would qualify as a small section of LAX. Like in the US they don't stamp your passport on your way out. Upside: If you are flying in from the west or north at day time get your camera ready for some great sights as you approach the Island. The drive to the city on a sunny winter day has gorgeous views. Rolling hills crisp cool air bright sunny skies. Its breath taking. As for Auckland Airport: its pretty mediocre. Its getting into and out of the airport by air or land that's so scenic.,8,1
auckland-airport,Ian Mackay,Australia,In regard to the previous comment if you're from a foreign country you should expect to be questioned on arrival. In regards to finding your gate number I admit I've always found it a bit odd at Auckland that check in sometimes don't know it but the information is easily available on the many information boards before and after you pass through security. Auckland is a good airport and is a breeze to use polite helpful staff and a large departure hall plentiful food outlets and you don't have to walk miles to get to your gate. You also don't get ambushed by staff trying to sell you things as you do at many American airports as you walk through duty free to reach your gate. The arrivals hall is attached to departures so if you need to transfer its a 2 minute walk. Buses / taxis etc are within easy reach and there is a 24 hour airport bus service to the centre of Auckland for 16 NZD. If you want an airport with poor transfer links try Sydney! Auckland has got it right be it the staff or the facilitates.,10,1
auckland-airport,Joseph Ferrerosa,United States,I didn't like this airport one bit! They questioned me when I got there. On leaving the airport they don't even give you a Gate #. This is unacceptable in my home airport LAX because its extremely busy and they could never waste time like they do in Auckland. This place is not satisfactory at all! This was as bad as Canada (YVR). Yet for some reason Heathrow is much better.,2,0
auckland-airport,N Samihah,Malaysia,Arrival and departure were fast pleasant and welcoming airport staff customs and immigration easy access to the city and to the domestic terminal. Nothing to complain about.,8,1
auckland-airport,Eric Simpson,United Kingdom,"Arriving at Auckland was a breeze. Aircraft door to car park in 25 minutes. Staff were helpful and welcoming the Immigration officer spotted that my birthday was in a few days time and wished me a happy birthday. MAF officer couldn't have been more helpful in addressing a quarantine query. I realise that I could have been behind several hundred passengers who had just touched down before my flight and indeed I have been in that queue! However I have always found that the staff who work at the airport seem to go out of their way to say ""Welcome to New Zealand we are glad you have come to visit us."" Many other international airports could learn a lot from the officials at AKL.",10,1
auckland-airport,Rudolf van Niekerk,New Zealand,Found the airport to be clean and well staffed. Staff were friendly and our bags came through very quickly. Even the customs staff were friendly and helpful!,9,1
auckland-airport,Ross Clark,United Kingdom,Into AKL on EK Thursday 18 Oct exiting 11 November. A game of two halves: arrival was a pretty fraught process because EK have so timetabled it that two A380s and a B777 arrive within half an hour of each other (early afternoon) and the baggage hall is not really large enough to deal easily with that number of people at once. The E-gates work fine. Departure was much better; EK had extra staff on to speed up check-in and the two Pier B gates have enough room just to cope with two A380s' worth of departing passengers. For once the duty-free was decently priced. I still like AKL but its international baggage collection now needs work.,8,1
auckland-airport,H Bois,Russian Federation,My Biggest complaint about this airport is the lack of free wifi. The food options are not great airside (we ended up with a microwave heated chicken roll grim) and pricey. There is a McDonalds on arrival and upstairs on departures there is quite a few good eating options. One person commented on the touts at the duty free on arrival I also find this bizarre and disconcerting after a long flight. All in all it tries hard but you will see from these reviews that Kiwis think it is fab but other nationalities know it could do better. The smart gate passport readers are not OK for under 16s so if you are travelling with a family they are useless.,5,1
auckland-airport,L Harvey,New Zealand,MEL-AKL arrived at 10.45pm in the car and away within 20 minutes incl collecting luggage that's pretty good isn't it.,9,1
auckland-airport,Chris McQuaid,New Zealand,Last used ten days ago when returning from Brisbane. I agree with parts of most of the latest reviews although from this first page you would think people are talking about two completely different airports! Yes it is a long walk to/from either Gates 14/15 (Virgin Australia or the A380s) and also those at the end of the main pier (9 10 etc) and I was surprised that there is no travelator in the main pier (possibly because the corridor is a bit too narrow to safely install one). However the entry through the carved Maori gate with accompanying music is far superior to any other airport I've ever seen. I too resent having to walk through the duty-free shops to reach Immigration but Smartgate makes up for that - kiosk and photo took no more than 60 seconds. MAF was no problem and I was outside 25 minutes after leaving the aircraft. Departure had also been easy - short queue to drop my bag as I had checked in on-line although again there is the long walk to the far gates. Food prices although a bit expensive are still far less than at Australian airports.,8,1
auckland-airport,Simon Gilmore,New Zealand,I don't appreciate getting off a long flight from Narita to be assailed by touts from Duty Free Stores and JR Duty Free. But this is Auckland Airport. It's all about making a buck. Don't worry about the passengers or those visiting the airport. Toilets are dire too!,5,0
auckland-airport,Adrian Jenkins,New Zealand,Auckland Airport is my home airport and is usually a pleasure to pass through it. The check-in area is spacious and I've never waited too long to check-in. Upstairs and airside there are a wide range of shops. Yes - the prices are high in some eateries but that's common in many airports around the world. Sure the walk to/from the farthest gates is quite long but no worse than other big airports. Arriving it's lovely to have Maori music playing beside the big Maori carving gate. The path through to the immigration gates between the two duty-free stores is now much clearer than it used to be. As a New Zealand passport holder I can make use of the Smartgate system - so quick and easy. Auckland Airport does now have a hotel right beside the international terminal which is great for those people with early departures or with long layovers. Granted this is not a 'transit hotel' as such as you have to go through immigration but true 'transit hotels' are few and far between in airports around the world (Singapore & Dubai being two notable exceptions.). One major down point I will accept is that there is no train service to Auckland Airport. The Auckland Council is thinking about changing this but it could be some years away yet. There's also no direct road from the airport to the city. You have to connect between two motorways via city streets (with traffic lights).,9,1
auckland-airport,Lou Colquhoun,New Zealand,My wife and I arrived here after a great flight from Sunshine Coast Airport in Queensland. The first problem was the connection to the plane itself which was faulty and we waited on board for approx 25 minutes to get off! The walk from where our A320 landed was at least one km long two small moving stairways. An airport staff member passed everybody quickly on a 4 person golf cart but never offered to take anybody with him. The shuttle bus to the domestic terminal is a disgrace running every 15 minutes or seemingly at the will of the driver. For elderly passengers to fight their way on to this struggling with heavy cases is downright dangerous. The airport is in our case a necessary evil we would avoid it if we could. Our flight was DJ8068 on 2/9/12.,1,0
auckland-airport,T Fox,China,I travel to more than 50 airports every year and Auckland airport is the worst airport of all. Long queue at the customs (sometimes only one immigration officer working) strict immigration unfriendly airline agents and unorganized airline staff and too many giftshops no transit hotels. I feel this airport is not welcoming tourists. My advice is to avoid Auckland if you really need to use it then transit only.,1,0
auckland-airport,K Kanages,Australia,The airport is now much better than when we first were there 4 years ago. The renovations have really improved the place. Wait times for your bags is slow though almost as bad as Melbourne. Was impressed.,7,1
auckland-airport,Pek Tan,Malaysia,Awful airport very disorganised both on arrivals and departures. Immigration and customs staff are the most unfriendly people I've ever encountered akin to a prison. Baggage was an abysmal wait. Not impressed at all.,2,0
auckland-airport,B Gilliland,New Zealand,A lovely airport with (usually) pleasant staffing. Unfortunately baggage retrieval was again slow only equalled by Tullamarine and as per usual the MAF counter was undermanned and poorly organized. (Why is bureaucracy synonymous with bad management?). This is not unique to here but that's a poor excuse. Also airlines landing in clusters seem to predicate baggage jams and grumpy processing. WiFi and charging stations would be helpful to travellers.,5,1
auckland-airport,A Meleisea,New Zealand,Despite having arrived in AKL alongside a few other flights going through arrivals was very streamlined and quite efficient. Smartgates for NZ/AU passport holders helped me bypass the long queues my bags were promptly on the carousel and going through MAF checkpoint was quick. All in all got from the plane to the arrivals hall in about 15-20 minutes. A nice end to a 25-hour trip that started in Newark.,9,1
auckland-airport,Michael Brown,New Zealand,The airport seems to be very modern and has recently been renovated. I like the use of the new smart gate for AUS/NZ Travellers as it will now speed up waiting times for those of other ethnicities.,10,1
auckland-airport,Eric Simpson,United Kingdom,I have always found arriving at Auckland International Terminal to be a refreshing experience. The walk from the A380 gates is slightly on the long side. I like being able to pick up my pre-ordered duty free shopping on arrival. Fortunately there were no other flights being processed so there were no queues at Immigration where the officer was equally welcoming. Bags were arriving on the carousel by the time passengers reached the baggage hall and MAF procedures were completed with the minimum of delay. I know processing can take longer but after a 30 hour journey 35 minutes from leaving the aircraft to greeting my waiting family.,9,1
auckland-airport,D Winda,Malaysia,By far the worst airport I've been to. I have travelled a lot to Auckland (3 or 4 times a year) and each time I've never had a good experience with this airport. Staff are so unfriendly they never smile and appeared to be sarcastic. Food prices are expensive and the airport is old. Always had long queues at customs - last time it took me one hour. What a waste of time!,1,0
auckland-airport,K Sung,Hong Kong,The baggage area in the arrivals hall is horrible. The floor looks old and signage is unclear. I arrived in the afternoon about 10 flights landed at the same time. The baggage hall was so full that passengers could not move. I blame the airport for the poor outdated design of the arrivals hall and trying to land too many passengers. Many passengers were confused near the exit blocking the way as they were trying to figure their way out.,3,0
auckland-airport,P Stratford,New Zealand,"It is disappointing that at busy times in the arrivals area at the International Terminal their is a conspicuous absence of Airport Staff to keep people moving from the exit after leaving the security area to the public meet and greet. Delay in updating ""International"" flight arrival times by Auckland Airport on its website and flight arrival boards is most frustrating for persons meeting arriving travellers. This situation which happens far too often is grossly unfair and in a situation that can cost the waiting public dearly when they are required to pay for the additional car parking charges which would be avoided if the correct times were posted/advertised on the Airport's website and flight arrival boards.",8,1
auckland-airport,John Samson,New Zealand,Arrived off MH131 from KUL. Baggage claim area hot small and had to fight the crowds to get near our bags. Reached the gate where NZ/Aust passport holders walk through only to be shunted to other passports by rude staff and made to wait 2 hours with at least 250 other travellers while we were herded through bio security and x-ray procedures. What a disgrace. What's worse is the NZ/Aust side was completely empty with staff standing around talking. I have been to many airports worldwide and Auckland International would be by far the worst so far.,1,0
auckland-airport,J McNabb,Canada,Int'l terminal is bright and compact with lots of signage. Arrival procedures are quick and painless. Immigration is fast and friendly. The only snag is baggage pickup which can be slow sometimes but that may be more the fault of the airline. Departure procedures are surprisingly quick. Domestic terminal is a bit dated and there's hardly any F&B past security. However it's so compact it takes less than two minutes to walk from the security checkpoint to the gate. The only thing I hate about the airport is its lack of good public transport and the fact that there's no direct motorway access to the airport.,9,1
auckland-airport,Ross Clark,United Kingdom,Inbound 25 minutes from plane to welcoming area - a lot of this is the E-gate system and the authorities have also done a lot of other things to make things work well. Departing the E-gate system is now used on departures and has speeded things up a lot too. Security also very prompt.,5,0
auckland-airport,J Cobcroft,Australia,Much improved over last time. Good shopping and food areas. Friendly customs and immigration. Well signposted. 'E' lanes a breeze.,5,0
auckland-airport,Ian Webb,New Zealand,Auckland airport is a disgrace. Baggage delivery is by far the slowest I've ever encountered anywhere in the world (waited at the conveyor belt for 75 mins before any of the baggage from my flight was delivered). The international terminal is dull and depressing and the domestic terminal is just downright grotty with very poor layout and woefully inadequate signage.,1,0
auckland-airport,Simon Gilmore,New Zealand,Auckland Airports constant aim of never letting any structure remain for long is unsettling. They have changed the arrivals greeting area yet again and it is a mess The upstairs bar near the viewing deck is gone. In its place is a gloomy corridor where childrens artwork was once displayed. The airport management try too hard and should leave things as they were. They also moved Jean Battens plane from the departure lounge which was pointless.,3,0
auckland-airport,L Potts-Warde,United States,This is a pleasant small airport with remarkably helpful staff and vendors. Customs was thorough but friendly and efficient. The line moved swiftly and there were many signs to let travellers know what to expect. The rental car lots were a short walk across the street from the terminal and signage was bright and clear. When asked for directions most workers would either walk with us to the locations in question or find a map for us.,5,0
auckland-airport,M Tate,New Zealand,Pleasant enough airport. I hear they are about to open a KFC - bad move! Domestic bathrooms need a big revamp very small and you end up sharing with all of the taxi drivers so always seems to be a queue when I go through in the mornings.,4,0
auckland-airport,Paul Harvey,United Kingdom,I was an international in-transit passenger and the experience was not a great one. Arriving on an international connection flight from Christchurch (NZ302) the whole plane of connecting passengers firstly had to be processed by one of two security lines. Then we had to hot foot it to the connecting gate (10). This is the gate used by ANZ US flights and is some distance away from the arrival gate. There were not enough seats at that gate to accommodate more than 25% of the flight no one could hear the boarding announcements there were only four toilets and it was generally not an good experience. Consequently the flight left late. The main shopping area in the international terminal is very smart and well lit downstairs is not and is shabby. If you had a choice you would go elsewhere.,2,0
auckland-airport,Sean Ryan,Australia,Another makeover airside for Auckland all though the shops are the same it is a little bit swisher and more open. A noticable lack of seating anywhere for a busy little airport it is a struggle to find anywhere to park yourself and the bar is the worst - very expensive surpassing nightclub prices for a beer?,4,0
auckland-airport,Kathy Voyles,Netherlands,Delighted by the new airport departure lounge lovely gelato gorgeous sushi beautiful art to drool over and buy. Some of the best souvenir shop. Relaxing refreshing and clean toilets. I would have been happy to stay much longer and I don't usually say that about airports,5,0
auckland-airport,K Fox,New Zealand,International departure male toilets aged with tiles fixtures and vinyl showing a lot of wear and tear and gives the impression of being unclean. Out of keeping with other parts of the airport. Large screen TV located in foodcourt near McDonalds for International Departures set to a channel showing movie with frontal scenes of a topless woman. Totally unacceptable given the public area and young kids present. Seems like anyone can change the channels.,1,0
auckland-airport,G Philp,China,Surprisingly this airport has been voted in the world top 10. The delay at immigration was unacceptable and they are going to pick up severe problems during the Rugby World Cup. There are many bottlenecks in the terminal which increase frustration levels. Seating at the boarding gates is less than adequate.,2,0
auckland-airport,Liam McGuire,Australia,Bad experience at AKL airport this morning. Early flight (5:50am) meant all passengers seemed to arrive at check in between 3:30 and 4am. Only 3 desks open meant a lengthy queue which was fair enough considering the time of day. We got to the departure gate and it was closed we waited 40 minutes for it to open by which time all passengers on our flight plus a couple more were lined up and only 2 desks open. At about 5:10am a flood of staff arrived and things started moving although quite chaotic as people rushed to empty lanes. By the time we got through our flight was at final boarding call. Had no time to look around shop relax so cannot comment on other services.,2,0
auckland-airport,T Patrick,Hong Kong,Domestic is nothing special. If you not a Star Alliance member don't even go through to the gates till the last minute you cannot even buy a coffee. International was great - speedy check in quite a lot to look at and the oneworld lounge served great wine and food - rather a small lounge though. Much friendlier than Sydney especially at immigration.,5,0
auckland-airport,Chris McQuaid,New Zealand,Check-in very quick and painless as I had checked-in online. One great thing about Auckland is that because it has fewer international flights than most comparably sized cities elsewhere in the world there is not the major panic to get through Emigration and Security to make sure that you don't miss your flight. Result - a much smoother transition with staff who are generally smiling and friendly. As I live fairly close to the airport I don't normally bother eating there although prices don't appear too much worse than in the city (certainly not the eye-gouging 500-600% markup I saw in Russia). The only criticism I would make airside as I have before is that it's a very long walk to Gates 15 and 16 and that more than one short travelator would be welcomed by most. Returning was easy for me - although there were quite long queues at Immigration I was directed to the new SmartGate as I have an e-Passport. Through and done in under a minute - brilliant! Luggage was already waiting on the conveyor and I was through MAF screening and out in the concourse in just a few minutes.,5,0
auckland-airport,S Ryan,Australia,I have never really had any hassles with customs/immigration. While not gushing with joy the immigration officers are not rude. I agree that transport from the airport to the city is terrible either a bus that takes forever for NZ$15 or a cab which takes equally as long for about NZ$60 depending on which way the driver goes. Airside is limited and expensive (like all airports).,4,0
auckland-airport,Darren Kilminster,Australia,Arrived in Auckland and after going through Immigration our travelling party was given the 3rd degree. Unsure why although having a Chilean citizen with us may have been the issue as the questions were all directed at him. Was sent down a corridor for further screening and the woman there was not sure why. She went away for a moment and came back and said it was a mistake and to just go through. A nice warm welcome to NZ ? Left 6 days later - painless check in and customs clearance. Airside at Auckland is a bit lousy. Not much going on and if there are a few flights leaving it can get a bit crowded. An OK airport but I can't believe it was judged best airport in Oceania.,3,0
auckland-airport,R Handelman,New Zealand,Public Transport to/from Auckland Airport is awful and very expensive. Landside is fine and with the introduction of Smartgate Immigration & Security are good but once you reach Airside there are about 2 places to eat a meal which I don't think merits the 5/5 ratings. All in all Auckland is a relatively efficient airport but there are still a few things to improve.,3,0
auckland-airport,J Clark,New Zealand,Use AKL airport 15+ times a year not a great airport no express immigration for long-haul premium passengers and queuing after the duty free shopping. Immigration like to pick on passengers who are not NZ residents from the moment you step off the plane. Terminal itself is fine but software is bad as referring to the services.,2,0
auckland-airport,M Graham,United Kingdom,Disappointingly shabby compared to two years ago. The immigration officer was unsmiling and unfriendly. Not the best welcome to New Zealand after 25 hours of flying.,3,0
auckland-airport,Anthony Gibbons,New Zealand,Flew Auckland-Apia (Samoa) return. No queues and best bit was clearing immigration in less than 1 minute using the new Smartgate self processing kiosks available to NZ/OZ passport holders. Then straight down to baggage claim. Would have been out in less than 10 minute after landing but for needing to go through Red lane (goods to declare). Even after being stuck behind a gaggle of passengers was still out of airport 15 minutes after landing. Only weird note is ladies calling to you from the inbound JR duty free to come visit their store - and offering mini-Toblerones as an inducement. JR Duty Free if you are reading this review I cringe at your sales antics.,5,0
auckland-airport,James Scott,Australia,Flew through this airport twice in the last month and the upgrades have made it more pleasant. The retail area at the international terminal has been expanded and a lot of natural light let in which is pleasant. Queue's at Check In and Border Security were exceptional less than five minutes each outstanding for an economy class traveller. The toilets and showers are well maintained. The Domestic Terminal is also very good with plenty of shops and food options and Air New Zealand's self check-in is easy and uncrowded. Duty Free on arrival at International is huge and the new arrivals facilities are brilliant.,5,0
auckland-airport,Jennifer Capper,New Zealand,I've been through Auckland airport 6 times and agree it's small and doesn't have the shopping facilities that the large ones have but have always found the exit through customs fast and very friendly.,5,0
auckland-airport,Tyson Higson,Australia,I found Auckland a very nice airport to go through. Although one thing I find amusing is the two duty free stores that are side by side as you approach passport control with employees hired to come out of the store and literally grab you to go into their duty free shop. I have never seen anything quite like it outside of Asia. There was a bit of a walk between aircraft and customs but it is an enjoyable walk with some New Zealand artwork on the walls. The arrival and departure halls can be very crowded. Transfer to domestic terminal was simple and only took a few minutes.,5,0
auckland-airport,F Pang,Qatar,I travelled through AKL over last two weeks on a family visit. The airport was not big but everything seemed organized: clear signs well-maintained queues for immigration security check-in a decent range of shops where I was really interested to buy (NZ-made foodstuffs) etc. A drawback was that immigration queue was always long. Having travelled to AKL for 4 times I knew this so I always walked as fast as I could to get ahead of other PAX in order to reduce waiting time.,4,0
auckland-airport,Philip Reindler,New Zealand,Compared to others I have been to this place is a pleasure to visit. Staff are friendly and helpful lots of shops and food options and not overpriced. Signage excellent and is logically laid out. Generally clean modern and good facilities plenty of toilets. Queues for customs and immigration short and fast. Plenty of seating at the gates,5,0
auckland-airport,Henry Tib,Australia,Auckland airport is very easy with plenty of shops and catering outlets. Checkin staff pleasant and informative.,4,0
auckland-airport,Steve Hayes,New Zealand,I have used AKL eight times this year for various trips and each time has been a breeze. Short queues generally the trip from plane to curbside has been completed in under 30 minutes. I am aware of bag screening requirements. However if I were from overseas I am sure I would benefit from more prominent signage in the in the arrivals area where you have to have all your luggage screened by MAF to check for unauthorised plant material or food. I noticed on my last trip in that some passengers appeared to be unaware of the requirement and had to be corralled back to get their bags checked. The land side departure area is undergoing some refurbishment at the moment and as a result space is a bit tight. But once through immigration it is all good. Plenty of reasonably priced duty free options. Good lounges if you have access. Air NZ one has just been done up and is very nice indeed. For smokers there is even an outdoor smoking area.,5,0
auckland-airport,K Phillips,United States,It is a 5-10 minute walk from the International to the Domestic terminal very pleasant after a long haul. I use AKL once every 3 months flying in from LAX and only once in a year have I had to wait at passport control or the x-ray. AKL is one of the easiest fastest airports to get through. In June I was off the plane and outside the terminal building in 20 minutes.,5,0
auckland-airport,Brian Cose,United States,I truly enjoyed this airport. Security and transit area nice. Everywhere I went anyone I asked help from went above and beyond. I had trouble with an International Phone Card I bought at one of the kiosks. The clerk took the time to close the kiosk and come and help me. The shopping was amazing and staff again nice and polite.,5,0
auckland-airport,C Ryan,Australia,Inbound into Auckland arrived at 5.45am I had one of the most pleasant trips through immigration. Straight through passport control bag already on the conveyor belt and I didn't have to queue up for quarantine. Outbound just as good - such a pleasant experience.,5,0
auckland-airport,J Obracle,United Kingdom,One thing I like about Auckland is its size it is small so I don’t need to walk that long to get in and out of the airport. Once you arrive you will find the largest duty free shop in New Zealand which is about the size of a minimart. You will then find an irritate immigration queue. I spent almost two hours at the immigration queue and extra 45 minutes waiting for my bag to be x-rayed at MAF biosecurity checkpoint. There are few washrooms at the airport and old and sometimes dirty. I have to wait in line in order to use the toilet facilities at the departure gate. The airport information screen is not very useful; the gate number will not appear until 15 minutes before boarding while the plane is already at the gate. Once you pass though the passport control and security there is only restaurant in there Burger King. If you are planning to visit Auckland I suggest that you buy some food in the city before you go to the airport.,1,0
auckland-airport,K Weimar,,"Just about any international flight is going to be a long one and people will be disgorging from their 747's and A340s sleep deprived and disoriented. Thanks to some brilliant flight planning a bunch of flights arrive at the same time - around 4:30 am and then the fun begins. There are two different queues one for people making international connections and one for people making domestic connections. But there are no signs. (well no signs at the BACK of line so you walk up front to figure out what queue to get into then head all the way back to take your place). At least two ANZ 747 flights arrive simultaneously (SFO & LAX). But they only have 2passport officers on duty. So you stand. and stand. And stand. Until about 6:00 am when clearly the next shift starts. And suddenly the line starts to move. Well you figure after giving them an hour and half to unload bags yours should be on the belt right? Wrong. I thing the baggage handlers have the same shifts as the passport guys. Unless ANZ loses your bag. Then you have to wait again for customs. And wait and wait. And wait so long that you dont have time to wait in the next long line to check in your bags at the transfer desk. ""No worries"" they say with that wonderful laid-back Kiwi attitude. You can just check them in at the domestic terminal desk. Just head out to sidewalk and follow the blue line. Did they mention that there was a bus? Or that it is a long long walk? No. Of course not. I've been in third world airports that were more efficient.",2,0
auckland-airport,Ross Clark,,Pier B (gates 15 16) does take a walk and possibly needs more shops for departing traffic but it is very spacious. Inwards passport control couldn't be faulted also the departing check. Still a good airport in the 5m international pax per year category.,4,0
auckland-airport,Chris McQuaid,,Returning from Sydney it was sad to see that the entrance to Auckland is now also through (rather than beside) the duty-free shops. It's quite a long walk from the new gates built for the A380 and although the line for Immigration was moving fairly quickly it still took another 15 minutes to reach the desks where everyone appeared to get a really friendly welcome. Free tea and coffee available in the baggage area but because of the delays my suitcase was already on the carousel. Although I haven't seen it anywhere else Agricultural Quarantine screening is something all New Zealanders are very grateful for.,4,0
auckland-airport,Chris McQuaid,,Had checked in online which meant only a few minutes in the queue to deposit suitcase. Friendly staff all the way from checkin through Customs and Immigration. However this was the first time I had used the new pier built for the A380 (although I wasn't fllying on one). There are four travelators because it's a long way from the main departure concourse (at least 400 metres) to the lounges at Gates 15 and 16 but only the first (and shortest) was working. Very comfortable seating in the gate lounge but no entertainment that I could see.,4,0
auckland-airport,Eric Simpson,,Auckland has always struck me as one of the most pleasant and welcoming of airports arriving and departing through the new international pier felt slightly less so. Despite the artwork and some stunning views the new area felt somewhat cold and stark. The ability to pre-order duty free and to collect it in the baggage hall on arrival is a real advantage. From plane to kerbside took less than 40 minutes. Departing on a flight to Sydney was spoiled by one very surly and inefficient official manning the NZCS Pre-Clearance desk. I have always found staff at the airport to be pleasant and most helpful and was saddened that this one individual didn’t understand that his attitude reflected poorly on the airport and on New Zealand.,4,0
austin-airport,E Englert,United States,"A lot of reviews for Austin—Bergstrom International Airport are outdated (it's been a long time since 2009 y'all) or simply have nothing to do with the airport, such as hotel shuttles or traffic. I will admit a bit of bias on my part since this is my hometown, but really it's one of the best mid-size airports in the country. Terminal Signs and Directions: the airport installed interactive screens that help with way-finding. They are useable, but kind of slow. Signage is abundant throughout the main terminal. Queueing Times: In July 2015, ABIA expanded its ability to handle passengers significantly with the opening of a new passenger screening and customs facility. It's significantly easier to access the eastern part of the terminal from check-in. Terminal Cleanliness: The terminal is kept rather clean, and recycling stations are abundant throughout the terminal. The sorted system is somewhat unnecessary given the city's switch in recycling policy, but they're well-used. Terminal Facilities: There's some funky art in the terminal, and not in a good way. That being said, the airport is a sleek, modern building that can be somewhat overtaxed at times, especially around festivals, but befitting of the city. The Admirals Club leaves something to be desired. Not enough outlets. Food and Beverages: Good to excellent. Mostly local companies. The reason I take off a star is because honestly sometimes I just want some disgusting, processed fast food, and ABIA doesn't really have that. Airport Shopping: Again, mostly local companies operating stores, which limits the selection to Austin-themed merchandise, with no real duty-free. It's nice but nothing remarkable. Airport WiFi Service: Okay this is probably my biggest sticking point. The city is a high-tech hub. We're world-renowned for our technology sector. The WiFi should not be limited to ""Free for 30 minutes"". The airport has been growing for about five years straight as of writing this review, with several record-breaking years in a row. There's always something new to check out, whether it's an art exhibit or a new destination or airline being added. We've had two international carriers come in and start highly successful routes in as many years. I'm hoping the airport can keep up with the momentum.",9,1
austin-airport,John Walker,,"I had several trips each quarter to AUS giving me a chance to figure out how to use the airport. First give yourself lots of time to get from your starting point to the airport by car as the roads in and around Austin are terrible - badly designed and poorly maintained with tremendous volumes of traffic. Second give yourself more time if you are on the first flights of the day as the check-in and TSA security cannot handle the large volumes first thing in the day. Third prepare to have some sort of strange interaction with the TSA as they exercise their improbable variant of ""logic"". Fourth eat before you go to the airport as the options inside the ""secure"" area are plentiful but of poor quality. Otherwise once you are inside the ""sterile"" area the airport is well-designed and I see others have mentioned the good massage spot near gate 13. The bathrooms are excellent. Unfortunately you frequently need something like a stiff drink and a massage to release the tension associated with the bad roads long lines and ridiculous TSA.",2,0
austin-airport,E Mabley,,Austin Bergstrom Int'l is one of the best American regional airports. Southwest and American dominate here it can be costly to fly to/from the US west and east coasts and international service is non existent but the airport is among the most well-designed and efficient. The terminal is spacious overcrowding is seldom an issue and there are plenty of dining and shopping options. This airport should be used as a model for all new medium-size airports being planned.,5,0
austin-airport,John Philipps,,"One key to a good trip through AUS is to minimize your time within the sterile area as the activities are very limited. The restaurants within security are relatively expensive and serve very poor food especially those that purport to be airport versions of the local fare. No Starbucks. If you can avoid evening departures as this is when the live musicians play in the center area causing an already noisy airport ambience to become even worse. If you can avoid early morning flights as the TSA security theater is made worse by inadequate entrances resulting in lines that stretch the length of the terminal. For those with checked in luggage the lengthy wait times upon arrival can be problematic; however the airport restrooms are some of the best in the US. AUS has both a good heel bar and an excellent massage kiosk. The roads to the airport are very very poor and the signs are confusing at best just like the rest of the city so plan lots of extra time to get to the airport on the terrible Austin roads. The car rental facility is on site although ""customer service"" can be a problem.",2,0
austin-airport,J Levitsky,,The roads around the airport are poorly designed and constructed so it is not easy to find the airport or the rental car facility. This is also true of the rest of the Austin region so this is not unusual for the city where correct signage is at a premium. No Starbucks but lots of other local restaurants although their menus are limited. Lots of light and high ceilings but not an airport to spend lots of time at unless you like the massage spot.,2,0
austin-airport,Bruce Roberson,,Austin has free internet service Downtown but not at their airport. There is Not a Starbucks but they have a local substitute of a high blend coffee shop. I feel sorry for families traveling because there is not any kind of restaurant food that children will recognize. It would be nice too if there were more electrical outlets for laptops and phone chargers. It is kept very clean and the easy access to rental cars is a very big plus! Amy's Icecream is worth the calories.,4,0
austin-airport,R Jones,,"AUS is decidedly different from a lot of airports in that it tries to be well Austin. There's a live music stage in the center of the terminal and local businesses dominate the shopping scene. Much of that as other posters noted is annoying as you can't get a cheap snack and lines can be long. Shops are definitely ""Austin"" but needlessly expensive. The music is well hit and miss. I prefer quiet to some of that stuff! For the Starbuck's fans there's one in the terminal now. There are ""Austin-inspired"" murals above check-in. Great to have local artists but the art is rather pedestrian showing scenes of poor Hispanics. I think there's probably more to Austin than that. Getting in and out is easy although I have had long luggage waits. The roads and signage to the airport are OK but getting better. Seems like they built this airport without figuring out how to get to/from the place. No freeways to the place but supposedly they're working on it. Parking is not cheap but not expensive either by some standards. The cheapest is $7/day. Better to take the bus if you can if going away a long time. Car rental is usually easy. Taxi is easy. Blue Van may be a long wait and long drive as they drop off others. Early am flights (6:30am and earlier) are insane. Long long lines at security as all airlines seem to have flights at this time. Arriving earlier is not an option as the airline check-in counters and security don't open until around 5:30am.",4,0
austin-airport,G Kohl,,Austin airport is fine as long as you do not have to wait very long for your flight. Two good parts of the airport are the well-lit spacious feel to the building and the little masseuse station near gate 13. Otherwise the dining opportunities are very weak. If you want a Starbucks for instance forget it. If you want pale imitations of local restaurant chains you are in luck. Even more useless is an entire store a large store devoted to a local college football team souvenirs. The roads to the airport are terrible. Poorly-designed traffic flow is compounded by missing or misleading signage so visitors in rental cars give yourself plenty of time to find the airport and return your car. Customer service at the airport is not very good although not as bad as LAX or PHL obviously.,3,0
austin-airport,L Nathan,,The airport is very nice but the bus service leaves a lot to be desired. I missed my return date because my wake up call didn't come on time at my hotel. I had paid for a round trip on the bus when I arrived at Austin but the bus company would not honor my return prepaid trip from the hotel to the airport. I was surprised by their attitude and rigidity. I made it to the airport the next day courtesy of a couple bellmen from my hotel and their van. So my impression of the airport was distorted by that experience.,,0
austin-airport,C Carrington,,ABIA has been a moderately frequent stop on my travels for the past nine years and it is entirely in keeping with Austin in that it is weird. The total lack of the expected restaurants is not overcome by the rather grim local offerings and the oddball live music is sometimes interesting and other times annoying. The terminal is spacious and well-lighted but the connections appear limited to hub airports and San Jose. The Admiral's Club and President's Club are both pleasant and a small chair massage place near gate 13 is also nice but all three are frequently not open for business. The traffic flow for cars and rentals is very well-thought out but the roads in any direction from the airport are abominable. Weird.,,0
austin-airport,Christian Farias,,I went to university in Austin and have fond memories of the old Mueller Airport. Nothing special but had a good vibe. Also cuz it had a rather short runway will never forget the pilots having to stomp on the brakes which always made for good fun for this aviation enthusiast (especially when AA used to fly their DC10's into the airport) The new Austin-Bergstrom is outstanding in every way! In the US it really is the only airport that captures the local flavor - in food music design elements etc. It is also extremely spacious and user friendly. Why can't they replicate similar local esign elements in other US cities?! This airport really stands out in the US.,,0
austin-airport,David Guenthner,,The only municipal project the City of Austin has gotten right in 15 years. The terminal is spacious open and intuitive. The security checkpoints are manageable. The baggage claim is usually efficient. But what makes this airport special is the local flair. The standard airport fare -- McDonald's Taco Bell Pizza Hut -- have been replaced with local vendors such as Schlotzky's Matt's El Rancho the Salt Lick and Amy's Ice Cream. The music over the sound system is from Austin musicians and there is a performance stage in the center of the terminal. There is a gallery featuring the works of Austin artists. It is probably the only place where you can get a sense of the city just from being in its airport.,,0
austin-airport,R Walton,,Austin's Bergstrom Int'l may not be one of the biggest airports in the U.S. (25 gates total) but the entire project was treated with world class taste. It is a simple yet beautiful airport with all the amenities one could want.,,0
austin-airport,Andrew Levy,,Great new terminal is a big improvement over the old AUS airport. Very spacious and attractive. Moving in and out of the terminal is a snap. Above-average food service is available inside the terminal. I much prefer to make a connection in Austin than in HOU IAH or DFW. This is now one of the best airports in the country.,,0
avignon-airport,P Hartley,,A superb little airport - just one small building really. Not many major airlines fly to Avignon so there are only one or two plane loads of passengers in the airport at any time. Most of the time yours is the only large aeroplane and you are met at the door to the airport by friendly customs officers (most sporting superb Gallic moustaches!). You can see your luggage being loaded onto the carousel (very efficient) and the exit from the airport is less than 5 metres from the luggage hall. The three or so check-in desks seem efficient and all staff most accomodating. All in all a most friendly little airport that will hopefully avoid commercialisation that ravages its British counterparts.,,0
ayers-rock-airport,Xuess Wee,,A small airport serving only 1 main highlight in the Red Centre of Australia - the tourist attraction of Uluru and Kata Tjuta. I arrived by domestic service (I understood some international flights do use this airport) so customs were negligible. The airport is built on the edge of the desert and is surrounded by picturesque desert panorama. Being tourist orientated all sorts of tourist services were available immediately upon retrieval of baggage. A free tourist bus is available for pick up for everyone staying at the huge monopoly of Ayers Rock Resort about 20 minutes away from the airport which unless you are a local that's where you will be.,,0
bacau-airport,A Dron,United Kingdom,Probably the smallest airport I have experienced. On arrival distance between the entry doors from the apron to the immigration desks can not be more than 5 yards. This means that passengers have to queue outside which in inclement weather must be unpleasant. Passport checks were fast however. On departure similarly tiny landside area with minuscule cafe to left of entrance doors. Incredibly cramped check-in/security area to right of doors although check-in agent friendly and helpful. Security checks are very thorough - had to remove belt watch etc and they found small jar of jam I'd absent-mindedly packed in my carry-on bag. Departure lounge was standing room only for a single Boeing 737. Couple of vending machines are the only refreshment sources. Local people told us that a major expansion of the airport is planned but from look of abandoned foundations beside the existing terminal this is unlikely to be completed any time soon. In short staff seem fine but can not recommend because of lack of space and facilities - even allowing for the fact it's a regional airport not a major hub.,4,0
bagdogra-airport,Paul Harvey,United Kingdom,This is an old military airport which has only a few daily flights. It has a 'restaurant' and a souvenir shop (selling souvenirs you are unlikely to want). Security is tight and photographs are not allowed. My bag weighed more upon leaving than arriving and the only way to resolve this problem was to quietly pay a bribe less than the excess baggage cost. The toilets were smelly the seating areas both landside and airside were sufficient for the number of passengers using the two gates. The airport is totally disability unfriendly. There is parking nearby for more cars than the number of passengers likely to use the airport. It is close to the centre of town.,5,0
baghdad-airport,M Ziaebrahimi,Iran,Arrived from Tehran by MahanAir around noon at Baghdad airport (BGW) for the second time. Arrival hall quite warm maybe 34 degrees centigrade outside was about 46 degrees immigration is not so fast but working. Toilets are grim you can find shops and exchange services around as well as small shops for some drink or snacks. Internet cafe is available and not so expensive. You have to use special busses or cars to leave the airport terminal. these cars will ask for USD15 and will not take you to the city of Baghdad but to a hot dusty open area where you can take a taxi. departing to Tehran from Baghdad airport was very time consuming due to severe security measures in Baghdad. You have to leave your hotel at least 5 hours before your departure time. Again you have to use special cars or buses and the same rate would be charged. before reaching at terminal you have to pass through 4 security check points where all baggage and passports would be checked. they use dogs for baggage. It was about 50 degrees centigrade and we had to wait under sunlight for 30 minutes for last checkpoint before entering the terminal. Another two x- rays inside terminal before check-in area. Check in was fast passport control was OK and the transit hall was much better than arrival hall enough seats good air conditioned and peaceful place with some shops and restaurants. Due to severe security measures in Iraq and specially in Baghdad you have to take special cars 4 hours before your departure time due to unpredicted delays and interruption which may happen in check points. Anyway the Baghdad airport service is much better and improved comparing two years ago that used it for first time.,2,0
bahrain-airport,Cobus Crous,Kuwait,On Arrival passport control was quick and efficient even for an Eid Holiday. You could get all you needed from the duty free. I collected my car in a short time and I was off. Returning two days later for my departure back to Kuwait it was a completely different story. Firstly there is no place to drop of your rental car and you have to drop the car in the overcrowded public parking. I couldn't find a legal parking so I had to call the rental car company to come to the parking lot and take the car. Upon check in there was no queue system for Gulf Air and people jumped in front of me all the time. The people on the counter allowed this practice and made for a very unpleasant check in experience. Passport control was quick and efficient as it was the case on the way in. After passport control the airport is very basic and did not offer much for a traveler who needed to spend 3 hours at the airport. I ventured into the Irish pub which was terrible. I checked into the Marhaba lounge afterwards and the services where basic with very bad wifi.,3,0
bahrain-airport,M Beaman,Bahrain,Bahrain airport is incredibly efficient its entirely possible to be in the departure lounge 10mins after walking through the doors. Once in the lounge the duty free area whilst not on the scale of Dubai provides all the necessary shopping. There are two bars skybar upstairs (bit dingy) and the Irish bar by gate 12 which is much better. Standard fast food and coffee shops but if you have time recommend the Macaroni Grill Italian restaurant. Don't normally get many delays from Bahrain due to the relatively low number of flights from the airport.,8,1
bahrain-airport,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,Transit only. I hadn't been through BAH for years and I forgot how good it was. From getting off the aircraft to being in the Departures areas was about 8 minutes. (Try that in Dubai). The airport is compact with a reasonable array of Duty Free goods reasonable food choices comfortable seats spotlessly clean toilets and a good flight announcement system. The layout of the airport takes you back to the 80's when air travel was more fun than it is today. Excellent Airport built on a human scale - for people.,9,1
bahrain-airport,M Bertram,Australia,We just transited through Bahrain airport but we were impressed by this clean and spacious airport. It was well signed and fairly easy to get around and find both the Gulf Air lounge and the gate for our next flight. I wouldn't hesitate to fly through here again based on this experience.,8,1
bahrain-airport,Syed Adeel Raza,United Kingdom,I fly Gulf Air mostly and every time the torturous part for me is Bahrain International Airport. After landing and disembarking the aircraft there is a short walk to the transit area. Everyone for some fairly odd reason has to take off their belts shoes mobiles watches etc and pass through the security gate. I just don't understand this. We have just come off a plane! Security checks have taken place in our point of departure. So this is always painful as the lines build up rapidly if a few flights come in and the area is small. The staff at this security gates are not helpful. The airport itself isn't too great. The smoking area is a disaster even for smokers its too small and packed out. It is a small airport with not the best shopping facilities either. Not what I would expect from a middle east airport seeing Dubai Doha Kuwait and Abu Dhabi standards.,4,0
bahrain-airport,J Ingham,United Kingdom,It was the 5th time I have visited BAH and had no problems except the last time. Arrived with BA to find very long lines at border control when we finally got to the front our passports where taken off us and told to wait over there. We waited for 2 hours with nobody offering any help. My wife was taken into a room and quizzed for 10 minutes. Not happy at all wouldn't go to BAH again if didn't have genuine reason to visit on a regular basis.,5,0
bahrain-airport,E Dsilva,Bahrain,I find BIA very quick and efficient. It takes me a maximum of 15-20 minutes. I like the duty free however I wouldn't mind being given a wider variety of brands. Also I really think airport employees need to be a bit more friendly and the security personnel seem very relaxed. Having said that I really like this airport it saves me time and energy unlike larger mall-like airports.,9,1
bahrain-airport,Ashraf Hoque,Bangladesh,On arrival as a transit passenger I always find the environment is lively. Security check queuing time is not high has a comparatively small but good duty free. Toilets are pretty clean liked the orientation of food area having some good brands. Airports staff are helpful. In the business class lounge the food is good with great taste of Arabian English and South Asian cuisine with free WiFi.,9,1
bahrain-airport,A Milossavlyevich,Serbia,BAH was a great surprise on my BEY-MAA journey. Small and clean airport so much better than the nearby nightmare of DOH. Great transit times and free Wi-Fi internet that actually works with no senseless SMS authorizations and fees. A great airport.,9,1
bahrain-airport,G Becque,United Kingdom,"Transit is a nightmare - no fast track for J/F class. Due to late arrival of our incoming we had 45 minutes to catch our connection. Competing with 350+ pax with all their hand luggage to get through ""so called"" security for transit took all of that time and if our aircraft had not waited for us we would have missed it. BAH - sort it and treat your premium transit PAX as they deserve.",5,0
bahrain-airport,Raphael Sheffield,United Kingdom,Easy airport to transit through as it is small and compact (I had a 1hr 45mins transit time). Make sure your travel documents are in order as when I arrived at the transit desk 3 pax had been there for 4hr. The duty managers are all in the terminal and do not visit the transit desk that often it seems. Connecting Gulf Air to KLM no problems at all. The Dilun Lounge that is available for KLM Business class passengers is nice however located about 10min away from gate 12. I confirm the departure areas are extremely crowded at midnight with all the connecting flights and all the seating is occupied. BAH Airport is ok for a couple of hours but there is not a whole lot to do otherwise.,3,0
bahrain-airport,Mariana Yordanova,Bulgaria,I had the chance to fly via Bahrain International Airport several times. I would like to point that for such small island in Mid East like Bahrain you people build and care for such nice and clean airport. I am very happy I had the chance to visit it and experience it. Keep it up.,5,0
bahrain-airport,C McKenna,Greece,In transit on Gulf Air from Addis Ababa to Athens - 6 hour wait. No idea there was a pay lounge. Had duty free confiscated as not in sealed bag. Lucky it was only alcohol and not expensive perfume or the like. Bags checked through but had obviously been opened - padlock broken off etc. Be warned of these issues! Transit desk far too small for number of people.,3,0
bahrain-airport,M Guillemard,France,One of the reasons maybe that I fly Economy and do not go to the lounge (although the one time I flew business I found the Gulf Air lounge too small for the number of travellers poorly decorated and with a limited choice of drinks and food). The security controls are not done very seriously they do not ask you to remove your laptops and hardly look at the screen anyway. Gulf Air employees at check-in have always been very nice and smiling. The duty-free is quite big but the price level is not interesting at all except for cigarettes. The main issue is the insufficient seating capacity especially taking into account the fact that Middle-east flights to Europe are scheduled in the middle of the night.,3,0
bahrain-airport,James Wyatt,United Kingdom,Nice size airport no massive queues in or out. Airside reasonable array of shops but most items are quite expensive. Clean throughout. Dining options limited and a bit rubbishy. The main upside are lounges which are fantastic. Gulf First is brilliant as is the Dilmun - great view over the runway good array of food and bevs. Showers and so on. Not an airport to be for a long layover though - get out and into town if you can.,4,0
bahrain-airport,Bill Atkins,,Lovely manageable airport - fast processing on arrival and departure. Perfectly adequate facilities though could use more seating.,4,0
bahrain-airport,A Morais,,Been to Bahrain many times. Arrival/Departure at Bahrain airport is a pleasant experience. Visit visa formalities are a breeze for GCC expats unlike Dubai. Efficient polite and friendly staff makes you feel welcome (unlike some of the other GCC countries). The new duty free is very good too.,4,0
bahrain-airport,David Walker,,Very clean and small airport handier on shorter transit times as there is a lack of entertainment and like many middle eastern airports seats often vacated with many Asian Labourers on route home sprawled out over three seats each - who can blame them - its first come first served. If you are any lengthy stop over and flying economy it may be worth a visit to the Delmon Lounge you pay for entry but then everything else is free and its a great place to bed down for a few hours on the couches. If its not busy you wontbe asked to move either. Showers food drinks etc - worth the little bit of extra cash!,4,0
bahrain-airport,B Peralta,,Our 7-hour layover at the Bahrain airport turned out to a refreshing and leisurely. The Transhotel was where we usually stay in the past is under renovation at this time. I therefore checked out this site for ideas about what my husband and I could do during the long layover. However as we did not have Bahraini visas before our departure from Manila we had no option but to stay in the airport. Upon arrival we learned about the airport's pay lounge the Dilmum. Turned out to be the best decision as it proved to be better than the Transhotel. While there are no flat beds it has everything else - internet light snacks comfortable chairs reclining chairs television a family room and even shower rooms. The lounge is only three years old and boasts of modern interiors and furnishings. It is like a 5-star hotel but minus the beds. Our 7 hours seemed rather short in the midst of all the comfort.,4,0
bahrain-airport,C Jones,,I have been to Bahrain airport both in transit and as a final destination. It is small but preferable to Dubai or Abu Dhabi. Have always found staff there polite and accommodating. Having read previous reviews regarding the toilets - would agree that the ones close to the gates can leave a lot to be desired! However the bathrooms on the upper level between the restaurant and the bar and clean and tidy. Overall a far more pleasant experience than either of the airports previously mentioned or Heathrow.,4,0
bahrain-airport,U Dippel,,Been here on transit a few times. Short distances friendly staff. Big downside: no drinking water is offered no dispensers are available. When you have to sit and wait 12 hours this is actually pretty ugly. A plus is the readily available Internet connection and the reasonable number of power plugs.,3,0
bahrain-airport,Geoffrey Stevens,,I have travelled to Bahrain a couple of times recently using Gulf Air. I prefer this airport rather than Dubai. Check-in immigration security and baggage collection very quick. Also walking distances to gates very reasonable.,4,0
bahrain-airport,K Fennelly,,I have just used Bahrain airport as a transit stop on my way from Istanbul to Dubai and back. The airport a very small and therefore easy to transit through even for very tight transfers. It takes approx 15 minutes to get from your arriving plane to the next gate. A BIG word of warning though. Due to new regulations regarding the carriage of liquids in hand luggage even duty free purchases must be placed in a sealed clear plastic bag obtained at the time of purchase and presented at the security checkpoint in the transit area. My husband and I just lost 2 litres of spirits because we were not aware of these rules and where not offered sealable bags at the duty free shop in Dubai.,3,0
bahrain-airport,Leon Swardt,,Bahrain airport is modern and fairly clean and well maintained. However as another reviewer has mentioned there is not a lot to do. My girlfriend and I recently had to spend 10 hours in transit there and it was not a happy experience.,3,0
bahrain-airport,David Leston,,Bahrain airport is quite small and convenient for transit passengers but I wouldn't want to have to spend too long waiting there. It has limited facilities and once you've walked around the departures area (takes about 10 minutes) there's little else to do. Don't bother with the duty free shops either poor selection and highly priced.,3,0
bahrain-airport,Clayton Seymour,,Transited through this airport last month on my way to BKK. Very smooth transfer between flights. The airport is small crowded but clean. Duty Free is more expensive & selection nowhere near as good as DXB in fact I could have bought perfume cheaper in LHR. Two drinks in the small but uncrowded Sky Bar cost about 10 pounds sterling.,3,0
bahrain-airport,Iain Williamson,,Agree with all comments about taxi service to Bahrain airport.To be honest the situation is not acceptable. Taxi drivers will routinely rip off arriving or departing travellers. A taxi drive from the city should actually cost 3 BD. But all of this misses the point. Manama has now an excellent bus & minibus service. I cannot understand why this does not extend to the airport. However the airport itself is not unpleasant at all: consistently friendly and able staff in all sectors plenty of seats and well-stocked amenities.,,0
bahrain-airport,Paul Devine,,For the attention of Mr Ali Bader BD7 is approx £10.50. I bet they were happy to see you. No one gets taxi's here it's too traumatic. There is a phone a taxi service that is metered and 100% not a rip off ask any off the airport staff and they will give you the number. If the government here sorted out the taxi's so that they were the same as Dubai we would all be very happy. Bahrain's a great place by the way petrol 15p a litre cigarettes 75p a pack a can of coke 15p.,,0
bahrain-airport,Abhinav Shrey,,Arrived at Bahrain on 4th March '06 and left for Mumbai the same day. Got to spend some 4 hrs. there. Was quite good but the prices were sky- high. Definitely not less compared to other duty-free establishments. Though it was crowded the seating facilities were more or less OK. Even then there were lots of people sleeping on floor. There was just one junk food outlet and there was always a rush there. The best thing was the Ferrari's F1 car they had placed there in preparation for the coming Bahrain Grand Prix. The airport had a lively appearance because of it. There were lots of draws because of it too. There was a rush in the bus too while leaving for getting into my flight for Mumbai. The plane from Cairo had a direct connection to the airport by gangway. The guy at the boarding gate for Mumbai flight needs some coaching in manners!!,,0
bahrain-airport,Daniel Schlösser,,Pretty bad airport. It's too small to handle all the flights in the holiday season. You cannot do a lot of things and it's even difficult to find a seat in the departure area. There were only 2check-in counters for a full a320. But I guess that this is more Air Malta's fault than the airports. On the inbound flight lugagge was very slow. It took nearly an hour before the first bags came out and that at 12pm in the middle of the night with no other flight arriving due to a late arrival. There was no information given by the airport to when the luggage will come out. The luggage area was very small. I don't know how they want to handle a few flights at the same time. There are no gangways and you have to either go by foot to your plane or your bussed but only if you are not traveling Air Malta.,,0
bahrain-airport,Ashok Thomas,,It may not have all the chrome and glass of nearby Dubai but Bahrain airport is functionally one of the best in the Gulf region. Reasonably well connected to all parts the airport though small in size scores big in efficiency. Arrival is relatively painless with a short walk taking you to a row of immigration counters. Staff at these desks are polite - unlike what you find in some other airports in the region. By the time you go through to luggage claim your bags are already there. One sticking point though is transport to the city - only taxis most of whom don't use their meters which sometimes leads to new comers being fleeced. Departure is a little bit more of a runaround. You clear check in and immigration easily enough and the duty free shopping is great for an airport its size. Business class lounges are all right but around midnight when a lot of the flights to Asia and Europe depart the place can get to be a bit of a crush. That said you don't get the feeling of being in a cattle market that you get in Doha and Muscat. Clean neat and efficient Bahrain is a good place to travel and transit through.,,0
bahrain-airport,Chris Seal,,Small but check-in was painless (it helps if you are in business class!). BA use the same lounge as Priority Pass which for a Monday afternoon was reasonably busy. Not much food though.,,0
bahrain-airport,Sahardid Hussein,,A no frill's functional airport. Good thing it was quite well organized and clean. And the Duty Free selection is excellent. There is one Mcdonald's type place and the fare was OK. The security arrangement's slightly concern me. Checks are cursory and brief my passport was only glanced at and I was on my way to the gate. Bahrain Airport lacks any kind of public transport and one is totally dependent on taxi's i think this should be improved because the fares the drivers will charge are high as there is no competition for them.,,0
bahrain-airport,Ali Bader,,Bahrain is on the whole a not bad place to use. It does what a airport should do best get you in and out with the least amount of fuss. It is small it only has 1 runway and quite compact. On my short flight on Air Arabia from Sharjah (which is a appaling airport) on arrival I had a short walk to immigration. All the immigration booths were staffed and there was a short wait. I find the Bahraini's to be a very friendly people and not 'stuck up' like the other Gulf Arabs. He was very polite to me and since I had a British passport and was entited to a 3 month visa i asked for this and he gave me it. It was the first time I was in the country. The duty free shop is immediately behind immigration control but it is very very small and from what I could see there wasn't that many people using it. You go down a ramp into luggage section my carousel was in the last pier even that is not a long walk. I walked passed the green control into the arrival hall from my impression it was clean all the way thorough but i didn't see the toilets to say everywhere was clean. In the arrival hall are a few shops namely the big telecommunications firm's. There was a Batelco (main operator) and MTC. I opted for MTC and was met again by a friendly person. What spolied it was of course the transport into town. There is not train or metro system in Bahrain. I had to use a Taxi. Bahraini taxi drivers are really woeful and they ALL refuse to use the meter's. He asked for BD7 which is about GBP5. But I was told the normal fare into town was BD5. So beware the Bahrain Taxi Driver.,,0
bahrain-airport,O Doyle,,Checking in at Bahrain airport is pretty quick compared to other airports I've been to but I find the facilities inside the airport appalling. The toilets are disgusting and never seem to be cleaned there is a very limited choice of food outlets and non-alcoholic items are extortionately expensive in the duty free. Security is also very lax in a region where security should be paramount.,,0
bahrain-airport,Abdullah Mutawi,,I have lived in Bahrain for the last four years. The airport is the best functioning airport I have ever used (I travel two or three times per month) with respect to time taken for check-in immigration and security on the way out and immigration baggage collection and customs on the way in. No other airport can compete on any single one of these items and the Gulf Air lounge is truly excellent. My only concern is that security at the first and business class check in is very lax. I have been through the metal detector many times where it beeps and I have never been stopped. That is very scary.,,0
bahrain-airport,Patrick Van Reusel,,Arrival from Paris on a connecting flight to Bangkok. The airport was ok nice and clean. The tax free shops a expensive they charge more then normal retail shops in my country (Belgium: 21% tax) Food and drinks a reasonable priced they accept Euro currency change will be given in local currency. Toilets are clean and well maintained.,,0
bahrain-airport,M Chaudron,,Flew into Bahrain from Istanbul on 11 Sept 04 then flew to Frankfort on 14 Sept 04. Coming in to Bahrain was quite easy. We were placed on a bus taken to Passport Control where it took 10 minutes to go through. I had already applied for an e-visa which made things very easy. Returning out was a different story. The Gulf Air employees were surly and did not keep us updated on flight delays. The airport itself was okay with just enough services (food newstands etc) to keep the wait less than a complete bore. The airport was clean and the facilities seemed adequate to me.,,0
bahrain-airport,Rob McMurdo,,I agree about all the comments made by previous reviewers of Bahrain Airport  it is a terrible place to spend time if a flight is delayed . However there is no better airport in terms of function. I challenge anywhere else that allows me to be off and out the airport and home in 30 mins from landing. Departure too is simple and easy although a few well located mobile walkways to gates 17 and 11 wouldn't go amiss. I use the airport 3-5 times a month and its a pleasure - the only worry is that sometimes my destination is Heathrow!,,0
bahrain-airport,Eoin McDonnell,,One of the worst airports I have ever been in. The staff even in the duty free area are intrusive and haughty. The food is atrocious (unless you really like microwaved chicken burgers). Though the airport presents itself very flashily with lots of fake chrome and neon; most of the airport is just plain dirty behind this. What annoys me most is having now spent a total of over 7 hours in Bahrain on various trips; I have yet to find toilet paper floors devoid of pools and 'mud' or staff willing to do anything about this in any of the bathrooms. In an international airport you really shouldn't have to think ahead to bring paper with you. To be fair should you manage to notice the bar (if you get bored enough to start reading the elevator buttons) the bartender is friendly and attentive. Though you'll need a coat and preferably a scarf the air-conditioning is up so high.,,0
bahrain-airport,Brad McAlister,,I agree with E Euwen (18 March) - BAH is dirty depressing and lacking facilities. Look down the wing towards gate 15 I think it is - drab miserable and dirty. Travel to/from BIA about twice a month and things get worse with the exception of the GF lounge facility - but could that have got any worse !? The staff around the place are Bahrain Airport Services and not GF - a pity as these BAS staff at check-in and boarding are for the large part offhand and terrified of making a decision on their own - bureaucracy gone mad. The result is a lousy level of service across many of these areas. I agree that the tax free prices are not that good - they're getting greedy I guess. I generally prefer smaller airports like BIA but not when they standards slip to the present levels.,,0
bahrain-airport,Somnuek Homteeb,,I usually make my trip from Bangkok-Paris via Bahrain all the time. I found the airport itself is clean modern well-organized. The duty free shops are ok but not much selections to choose from. But one thing that I have seen since last year is the airport speakers - which doesn't work properly at all and I just don't understand how could they let this happen over for years.,,0
bahrain-airport,E Euwen,,I passed through Bahrain airport in July 2003 returning from holiday and it was a very disappointing experience. I cannot believe a previous comment that the duty free area is good: the two shops certainly look nice but they are just one retailer and consequently the prices are very high. The toilet facilities were really dirty despite the appearance of cleaners who seemed to be happy to do nothing about it. There weren't very many areas to sit and only 4 places to get refreshments: a burger bar a coffee shop a smoky bar and an expensive restaurant. I was extremely unhappy during my stay there I'm afraid to say.,,0
baku-airport,S Greenberg,United States,"A very clean, new and empty airport (when I visited). Fast free Wi-Fi is available.",10,1
baku-airport,Giovanni Cattaneo,Italy,This airport is really good: no problem at all very clean and new very pleasant staff and walking distances absolutely reasonable. Nice shops and Italian style bar with cappuccino few steps away from the gates. No issues with staff I reached the airport about 1 hour and 50 minutes before my departure time and 45 minutes later I was sitting in front of my gate ready for boarding. Recommended.,10,1
baku-airport,Brian Turnbull-Adams,United Kingdom,"Went for an 8am flight which ended up leaving at 5pm - no information no apologies nothing. Had my bag emptied of any loose change which wasn't glued down by some official looking guy ""assisting"" the passport control guy - only he had no identification badge or anything to suggest that he had a right to be there - just a nice looking suit. Seriously - if you can please avoid Baku airport like the plague.",,0
baku-airport,Emiliano Morchi,Italy,Baku airport in not too far from the city but in fact can be reached just by taxi which will charge you after negotiation no less than 25 manat which is enormous for local standards. The outlook of the airport in itself is not bad the main problem are the security checks upon departures. As the Russians also the Azeri love to check passports: from entering the terminal to the plane I've been verified 6 times which is quite annoying. Landside there are no facilities and also airside there are not many.,5,0
baku-airport,T Andrews,United States,Flew in on Azerbaijan Airlines. Found the airline to be incredibly warm and staff were gracious and went out of their way to assist me. Flew out on Turkish Airlines. Simply make sure to get to the airport with plenty of time to spare if you are not local as customs here are different and there are people who like to cut in line at ticket counters. I found that when I was pleasant so were the staff. Business class lounge in the airport is terrific. There is free wi-fi (I am writing this review from the lounge) and it is stocked with all sorts of alcoholic drinks soft drinks foods nuts fruit etc. TV's and comfortable sofas too.,8,1
baku-airport,Peter Thackray,United Kingdom,Flew to Baku for the first time. Arrival OK aircraft had pier and a short walk to Passport Control. Baggage Reclaim was 2 belts just after the Passport Control. Signs of revamp evident. Pass through the Customs Check and into Arrivals Hall. Exit is not clearly marked you have to run the gamut of taxi drivers no signs of a formal taxi rank or other transport links. No open banking facilities in evidence which is poor. Return flight more problematic Check-in is on the first floor and escalator not working so had to carry cases upstairs to check-in area. There is then an initial document check before actual check-in - relatively slow. Passport Control was ok and completed quickly. Once in the Departures Area not much open at 02:00 in the morning. Security Scan is made at the gate before boarding. The airport is clearly of an era and in need of an upgrade some of which is being done for Eurovision Song Contest in May 2012.,5,0
baku-airport,William Taylor,United States,Arrival was manageable departure a disaster. Baku check-in counters at farthest end of airport. No carts. Must go up and down several staircases and escalators. Must go through 3 different x-ray/scanning machines. For people with lots of or heavy baggage departure is a true nightmare. Smoking and stench of smokers is pervasive in all sitting areas and lounges. Flew business class on Aerosvit to Kiev and I was the only one paying business class fare. Aircraft was packed full and flight attendant had to kick out economy class passenger out of business class seat. Basically open seating for everyone on board. I was lucky to get my business class seat which I paid for. Baku Airport is a disgrace for a country as rich as Azerbaijan. If you don't have to travel to Baku don't at all costs.,1,0
baku-airport,David Gordon,,Three return journeys through Baku airport in the last five months and no serious problems. Immigration reasonably quick easiest if you already have a visa; baggage arriving at same time as coming out of immigration; pleasant business lounges. Taxi drivers on arrival are tedious - walk past the first few you see go outside and haggle for a lower fare. Security and passports are checked closely on departure but all good humoured. Well above average for international airports in post-Soviet countries.,4,0
baku-airport,S Madeley,,"I have used Baku airport on a regular basis for 3.5 years. Most of the recent comments I have read here stand (long queues / poor facilities / dirty toilets / appalling baggage services / overcharging taxi drivers). Strangely the Duty Free now charge solely in Euros (no longer the local currency or Dollars)! Did Azerbaijan join the EU and I missed it? Furthermore when asked to pay for a bottle of Vodka in Euros I was given my change in Dollars! Come on chaps stick to 1 currency please! Apart from Duty Free plan to spend as little time in this airport as possible. For a country that proclaims to welcome visitors Azerbaijan should be ashamed of the poor services and facilities offered. It is not worthy of the title ""International Airport"".",1,0
baku-airport,David Jones,,"Have been using Baku Airport for 10 years. Have never had any form of extortion directed towards me from anyone official. Did get caught by the baggage wrapper (once!) but other than that no hassle at all from Immigration or Customs. Security can be very very slow if there are a few flights departing at around the same time (Christmas-time is usually a nightmare). It's then that you realise that queue-forming is not high on the agenda in this neck of the woods. The moral then becomes -""if you can't beat them....."". The toilets are poor. Not very clean and the toilet paper supplied (if at all) resembles rolled-up tree bark! Just what you need before a 6 hour flight - NOT!. Never any soap or anything to dry your hands on either. Duty Free is basic but some things are cheap compared to Europe. The coffee shops are also basic and I have been charged exorbitant amounts for soft drinks - I now question each charge before I buy anything! If a taxi is taken upon arrival then you will have a big problem not being overcharged. In a nutshell Baku Airport can be a big challenge the first time you need use it. I have certainly been to worse (Lagos!).",2,0
baku-airport,A Sands,,The food is horrible and there is very little of it. Smoking in all food places is awful. The duty free shops (three) have the same items in each one. Expect a bored female with loads of makeup to follow you around the store like a pet. Passport control process changes all the time without any obvious reason. Loads of staff walking around or chatting in groups but not working. The passport queue is a joke with people cutting in line or jumping the queue. Immigration is a three ring circus pay no attention to the signage it means nothing. Expect to wait 45-60 mins for your luggage and pass thru another security checkpoint with lots of people cutting the queue some are allowed to skip the security process altogether. Boarding the aircraft can be a nightmare with no queues maintained just herding of people onto the plane and loads of overhead baggage.,1,0
baku-airport,Frederik Oegema,,I have been through Baku airport twice first in August last year and again in July this year in and out both times. Frankly my experience has been a lot better than most of what you see from other comments here: yes it's not a great airport in terms of facilities despite all the space the bureaucracy is not all too transparent or efficient either and you have to watch out for scams and extortion but during all my visits I have met neutral or even friendly staff at passport customs and check-in and no attempted requests for bribery. Upon arrival the visa procedure (for Westerners) is a bit odd: first get a stamp at the passport desk then back to the visa desk and then through to the passport desk again. Some people were not aware of this and queued up at the visa desk first and were then sent to the back of the passport queue first and then again the back of visa queue so that it took them an hour extra to get through. I was advised to sit at the front of the plane on my way in and pre-fill the visa application form in order to be at the front of the passport/visa queue; in reality I was all the way back but in the end this didn't make any difference as the people who were at the front still had to wait just as long as me for the luggage to arrive. Do bring your two passport pictures with you if you don't want to pay 10 dollars (or euros although that's worth 50% more) for them at the airport. The triple security checks at check- in are just a joke as I managed to 'smuggle' both a pocket knife and a bottle of water in my hand luggage through all 3 of them (I found out afterwards). I do suspect that my relatively good treatment may have to do with the fact I was flying European airlines (BA and Lufthansa respectively) on both occasions if that can be useful advice for anyone. In my opinion this airport is not as bad as most others in similar countries.,3,0
baku-airport,Javed Iqbal,,I agree with D Broessler. Worst airport in the region. Unfriendly and incompetent staff. Dirty toilets. No reliable information on delays dont know English and very important thing is very greedy immigration Officer want money off visitors.,1,0

baku-airport,Ramona Michetti,,"One of the most annoying aspects of the Baku airport is that terrible ground/baggage service. This must be the slowest baggage crew in the world. Expect to wait about an hour for luggage longer on the Dubai- Baku flight. Then after you do finally recover your luggage the customs personnel try to make you go through the ""declare"" line (especially for the Dubai - Baku flight) which requires putting luggage through the x- ray machines again. Another complaint is in regards to the toilets. There must be some way to train the staff what ""clean"" means. The cleaning ladies are always in the WC (some times sleeping on the counter) but it is never clean - even when they are mopping the floor it is a matter of moving the grime from one spot to another.",,0
baku-airport,Aidan O'Lynn,,Having lived in Baku for 3 years I always found that the airport was the worst introduction and farewell to Azerbaijan. The building itself is fine and the staff in the shops. However many of the security staff and customs officials are out blatantly looking for a bribe or trying to extort one and the taxi drivers try to charge ridiculous prices to the city centre.At least the security seems very good with the triple metal detector checks as opposed to much more lenient security elsewhere.,,0
baku-airport,Andrius Uzkalnis,,Yes bag-wrapping is a nice scam and visa photo is a nice little earner for the guys too. There is no benefit in having your bags wrapped unless you consider a tell-tale sign of arriving from the Former Soviet Union a good thing. Then why not also wrap yourself in plastic - that would preserve your clothes would it not? The duty-free is average and as for catering - I don't know I spent all the time in a lounge desensitizing myself with free drinks and eating sandwiches which frankly have seen better times. However overall it is a relatively spacious relaxed place. I've seen worse.,,0
baku-airport,Allen Coulson,,I got caught by the bag wrapping too but it may be a good idea to have them wrapped. The visa photo scam is one you can avoid if you bring your own photo - not so much a scam but an annoyance to pay $5 for a polaroid. Get the visa in advance and save a queue.,,0
baku-airport,Rene Jugmann,,Baku airport surprised me very much with its transparency! Not so much crowded and huge: enough space for everybody - quick check in and even quicker check out procedure. Well very nice architecture... full of light and funny colors - friendly national azeri advertisement - small shops and restaurants with good cuisine!,,0
baku-airport,George Santulli,,"I was in the Baku Airport twice and was caught once by the scam of wrapping my bags in plastic. A helpful guy meets your cab at the curb and whisks your bags on a cart to the ""wrapping station"" which seems like an official stop on the way to the ticket counters. Only when the wrapping is down and the hands come out looking for payment does one realize that it was a scam. I offered five dollars a lot of money in Baku I expect and the guy was visibly miffed. My return thru Baku had me on the lookout for the scam and yes the guy met me at the curb again but this time I firmly said..""NYET"" and moved him to the ticket counter while his ""wrapper"" buddy looked dismayed. Other then the fact that the seats in the waiting area are miserable the coffee shop awful and sour faced security people it was a fine fine airport!! Not!",,0
baku-airport,Iain Williamson,,Even though the days of the regular shakedown at Baku's bus terminal-style old airport be wary of efforts to make you bribe your way in and out of the airport. This includes the passport control pre-boarding (checking tickets and also just before actually entering the aircraft where army personnel can again take your passport and hold it quizzically sighing. Apart from these exotic annoyances Baku remains relatively clean to the point of being austere. Not recommended for the faint of heart.,,0
ballina-byron-airport,G Bray,Australia,This is a small domestic airport that has outgrown it's small terminal by a long way. It strains to handle anything more than two aircraft at a time. When I arrived there were 3 planes trying to be turned around in the same hour. Arriving passengers packed out the baggage hall with their friends and relatives while departing passengers filled up every other space in the airport. The queue through security went out the terminal door resulting in some passengers mistaking this as a line for check in and missing the check in cut off time limit but thankfully airport staff allowed them to still check in with the chaos. Beyond the single security point it was standing room only. With only two gates side by side more confusion occurred at people lined up for the wrong aircraft because of snaking lines in the small space. A new terminal which is planned but not going to be built for some time it can not come quick enough.,4,1
ballina-byron-airport,C Tudehope,Australia,For the number of passengers it handles the Ballina-Byron airport really isn't that big. For most of the day it's fairly quiet with REX operating its 36 seaters 3 times per day. However within a 2 hour timeframe both Virgin and Jetstar operate their 180-seaters into and out of the airport which causes it to almost reach breaking point. The departure lounge isn't in any way big enough to cater for a full flight and the ventilation leaves a bit to be desired. The ground crew from all airlines were friendly enough and the cafe wasn't too bad. However when comparing Ballina the second largest market out of Sydney to other regional airports like Albury Dubbo Newcastle and Canberra it really is sub-par. It needs freshening up made more open and indeed made bigger to cater for any future growth that may come about! It gets the job done-but it's nothing special-and definitely isn't inviting.,2,0
baltimore-washington-airport,G Lewis,United States,I fly out of BWI Southwest Airlines once a month to Tampa. It never fails when I return to BWI I have to wait 30 mins to an hour for my bags and it always starts like this. Your bags from Tampa will be on belt #1 and about 10 mins later they announce your bags from Tampa are now on belt #5. If you get lucky you might not get another belt change and in 20 min or so you bags will come out. If you have oversize bags such as golf clubs you can add another 10 min. The young workers in the oversize baggage area just sit on chairs and play with their cell phones never greet you or even recognize that you are there. The bottom line is that that baggage department at BWI is the worst in the country by far.,3,0
baltimore-washington-airport,A Kooyman,Canada,Are they serious about the rental car situation? This has to be the worse setup in the US. To get from the terminal to the car rental facility the bus takes 4 left turns on busy roads. On the way back you routinely get stuck in traffic - the rental shuttle tells you to allow 2 hours on your return! All of this in a region where cabs are as non-existent - you need a rental car for any appointment outside of downtown Baltimore.,1,0
baltimore-washington-airport,R Gonzaga,Malaysia,Great airport fast TSA checks with friendly smiling faces lots of food options and spacious boarding areas. The Southwest staff were friendly and professional from curbside to boarding lounge.,8,1
baltimore-washington-airport,O James,United States,Extremely long wait for baggage is unacceptable. This has been an issue for at least 5 years and BWI has done nothing to remedy this.,,0
baltimore-washington-airport,K Maeda,United States,"Possibly the worst airport I've flown into. Flying in I already had a car reserved but it took over an hour to get into a car and out of the airport. First you go to the car rental counter in the terminal and wait to get the contract set up. The car rentals are managed from a different building and it took 20 minutes for a bus to show up to take us from the terminal to the rental facility. When the bus arrived it was standing room only. On arrival at the car rental facility it's a fairly long walk from there to the individual pick up locations though the parking garage. No walkways just stripes to walk between. Then you wait again for a rental attendant to look over your contract and point you in the direction of the type of car you've reserved. After that debacle I determined to allow myself an extra hour to return the car and be on time for my flight. Return was somewhat better although the stop designated for my airline turned out to be incorrect because of construction. Returning the car only took half an hour from driving into the garage to arriving at the terminal. That meant I had plenty of time to make my flight so I set up my computer for the ""free"" WiFi. For free you're required to sign in again every 15 minutes. You can upgrade your service for $5 for an hour or $8 for the day. But you probably won't need more than an hour because you won't have found a place to plug in your computer or other rechargeable internet ready device. I ended up sitting on the floor next to the luggage carts because there was an outlet there. There was one other outlet I saw on the concourse but two people were already plugged in there and that was the limit. Before 9/11 tightened security and the major computer age I used to fly in and out of BWI fairly often. It was an attractive airport and close to home. Since then I've mostly used one of the two DC airports but I got a really great deal on a flight to BWI. I don't know whether in the future I'll consider any deal good enough to get me back into this airport.",2,0
baltimore-washington-airport,J Knack,United States,We flew from BWI to JFK. Check in went smoothly and quickly. The security line was long but moved quickly. The airport is clean and bright (especially when compared to JFK) and had decent food choices. The restrooms were clean for public facilities at an airport. Luggage pickup was pretty fast on our return. BWI is my choice of airports when flying into the DC/Baltimore area.,9,1
baltimore-washington-airport,M Lovell,United States,The time to get bags at BWI is unacceptable. Usually the slowest of all airports I use. It took an hour to get bags from a flight recently.,1,0
baltimore-washington-airport,P Delskey,United States,"As one of Southwest's major connection hubs I cannot believe BWI would shut down one of their runways ""under construction?"" and due to their ATC trying ineptly to direct air traffic caused thousands of people to miss connections! I lost a vacation day parking fees and a day and night with my 4 grandchildren in St. Louis today 10/25! What a mess and intentional? Why they couldn't schedule construction from 11pm to 6am and avoid the major air traffic I cannot imagine. I am now re-booked through Midway! Such a shame because I usually try to schedule through this airport.",4,0
baltimore-washington-airport,John Clift,United Kingdom,August 8th arrival and August 10th departure both with SWA. Like your previous commentator the BWI experience is awful and it makes no difference if its arrivals or departures bags take for ever to appear when arriving and then the little matter of the so called 8 minute ride to the rental car terminal. It is a shame because airside the terminal is one of the better USA airports in terms of facilities available but then again some of the employees no most of them are clearly not a very happy contented bunch so beware and don't ask them for anything. Overall this is not a traveller customer friendly airport.,4,0
baltimore-washington-airport,Jeff Brewer,United States,I travel weekly for work. BWI is in my opinion one of the worst airports in the country. I try to always avoid but many times the fares are just right compared to other DC area airports. Car rental buses are few and far between then you have a not so quick journey out to the rental car facility. Returning is even worse - why could they have not put a train system or built a road where the shuttles could easily go between the rental car facility and the terminal - just bad design. Then security at least at Concourse D is always packed and slow - they don't appear to know how to handle crowds. Again just my opinion - keep in mind that I do like the Atlanta airport.,2,0
baltimore-washington-airport,S Koenig,,On this trip we only arrived at the airport. Getting to baggage claim claiming our bags and getting a shuttle bus to the rather distant consolidated rental car facility was quick and easy. It's nice to have all rental car companies together so one can easily compared availability and prices though on the particular night we were there selection was very very limited.,4,0
baltimore-washington-airport,Bill Atkins,,Very variable experience depending on airline and time. Long lines at Southwest early but clears quickly as they are well organized. Horrible long lines at D security mid-morning. Delta check-in hopeless. Very limited food options landside but more choice airside. Excellent short-term parking situation though expensive. Beautiful International terminal with virtually no flights.,3,0
baltimore-washington-airport,S Koenig,,"BWI has been updated/refurbished but it seems to have suffered a decline in passenger traffic as have other airports. The one decent restaurant outside security that I remember is being made into a Subway sandwich restaurant. The two gift shops I found (Hudson News) were small and curiously did not sell TSA luggage locks (I seem to recall seeing these locks over at one of the area's other airports Washington National). Also did not sell luggage (the only place I found that sold luggage was the American Airlines counter to which I was directed by Delta Airlines; they sold only large bags none suitable for carry-on). Security line was not long and moved quickly. In Concourse C the choice for dining included an overcrowded ""pub"" a somewhat pricey small restaurant towards the entrance and something fas food-related.",3,0
baltimore-washington-airport,Michael Ellis,,I frequently fly through BWI (every other week or so) because unfortunately this is the closest and cheapest aiport from where I live. Although departing from BWI is always a piece of cake and it really is a very nice aiport arriving here is another story. After several long waits in the baggage claim I began keeping track of the time and found that the BWI airport was adding on average 34 minutes to my trip. That's 34 minutes of just waiting in the baggage claim area. The longest wait I experienced was over an hour and that was not just for my bag but the entire flight! I'm not sure if this is simply mismanagement or if there is something else going on but after this last trip (50 min wait in baggage claim) I will avoiding flying through BWI whenever possible. I recommend the same to anyone else.,2,0
baltimore-washington-airport,James Burke,,Flew in on Southwest and out on AirTran. Despite the size of the airport you are at your gate within 5 minutes of landing. The Southwest terminal is very easy to get out of. Light rail is a great way to get into Baltimore City just be prepared to walk about 10 minutes if arriving on Southwest. On departure there was a short line that moved quickly with upbeat and friendly TSA officers. AirTran's terminal is basic but has everything one needs. BWI is a very nice airport,5,0
baltimore-washington-airport,S Cochrane,,The airport is nice and modern and convenient to the metro Baltimore/Washington area. There is a nice observation area in the center of the terminal prior to airside which is a good place to watch planes and/or relax prior to your flight. Unfortunately if renting a car here this is the worst airport I've ever used. The consolidated car rental facility itself is very nice and spacious however the common rental car shuttle you must take from the airport is absolutely pathetic. I've used this on multiple trips over the last several years and it's been horrible every single time. The whole idea of using a common shuttle should speed things up getting to the rental facility however there are simply not enough shuttles running. Today at 2:45pm I waited at the USAIR baggage claim along with approximately 30 other people for several minutes for the bus to come. I was standing at what I thought was the end of the line and it turned out to be where the bus stopped. I felt guilty walking on the bus in front of all the people who had been waiting however I wouldn't have gotten on the already crowded bus otherwise and furthermore there was no organized line anyway. I was the first passenger on the bus and it was already standing room only! There was absolutely no where to put the luggage and it was cramped beyond belief. This is absolutely unacceptable and this wasn't an isolated incident. I can't imagine how a handicapped person elderly person or anyone with multiple bags could manage this fiasco. There should be several other busses in line waiting at the busy baggage claim area and when one is full (meaning everyone gets a seat and has room for their luggage) the one behind it then loads passengers. Considering this services ALL rental car agencies and there aren't other busses to get there this is pathetic customer service. If you are renting a car I would not recommend using this airport especially if I you have any large luggage (try DCA or IAD). If not renting a car then the airport is great and convenient however I give this airport a poor rating due to the absymal car rental shuttle service. A business traveler needs quick and efficient service and this airport does not provide it to rental car customers. (It formerly had the rental cars on property but moved them years ago to install higer-revenue parking garages).,2,0
baltimore-washington-airport,A Johnson,,Flew into BWI recently on Southwest. Airport is easily accessible from Baltimore city (20 min by car 30-40 min by light rail). Southwest has consolidated its two concourses with a centralized check-in desks and security lanes. Airport has been recently renovated so facilities tend to be bright and spacious. Security lanes were well-staffed and efficient. Usual mix of shops and restaurants airside. Only drawback is that there can be long walks between the gates at the end of concourses and check-in desks and/or baggage claim.,4,0
baltimore-washington-airport,Ian Lancaster,,I flew to BWI from LHR to take the train to Washington DC being fed up with the long immigration lines at Dulles. BWI is a modern airport which benefits from not being a main international point of entry. I was outside waiting for the shuttle to the train station about 35 minutes after getting off the plane - unheard of at IAD. But that's where the good news stops... too long to wait for the shuttle bus and the airport Amtrak station is a mess - confusing not good information and a slow slow elevator to get over to the southbound track. But DC's Union Station is a great place to arrive!,3,0
baltimore-washington-airport,E Tong,,Great airport with easy access to Baltimore. Interstate 195 spurs off I-95 and takes you straight to the terminal. Everything here is bright modern and flashy looking including the parking garages which are linked to the main terminal with shuttle buses that come very regularly. I flew Southwest out of BWI twice and its been great experiences a lot less crowded than other airports I've been in. There's a small aviation museum in the terminal and also an observation deck near the control tower which is good for waiting for flights. The food selection is very good and I would definitely recommend Philip's Seafood which has a location near the Southwest gates this serves authentic Baltimore crabcakes/seafood. My only real complaint about this airport is that it's actually too modern and flashy giving people false impressions of the area. Once they pass through the airport and drive into Baltimore there's in for a pretty unpleasant surprise. Besides the Aquarium no architecture in Baltimore can compare with BWI. I won't even get into why the Dominos sugar sign set on top of an abandoned factory could be considered a major landmark.,5,0
baltimore-washington-airport,Gerald Klingler,,We flew in and out of BWI this summer using the international terminal - how easy and quick. Very nice facility. Even we travelled with kids - checking in and the wait untill the flight was no problem. People were very friendly and helpful. BWI is a true alternative to IAD.,4,0
baltimore-washington-airport,Ro by ne Chamberlain,,I really like this airport. It is a good size and things move quickly. My experience of the staff tat BWI is that they have always been friendly and helpful. It feels manageable.,,0
baltimore-washington-airport,Simon Briggs,,I flew out of BWI recently to go to ORD. I like BWI because it is a managable airport. The new Southwest terminal is great. This time I flew on AA to ORD. The airport is undergoing a major refurbishment and so there are not many options when it comes to food at the moment but new restaurants should open soon. BWI is one of the most modern convenient airports in the US. It does not look tired and dated like most airports I have visited. I would recommend this airport is you live in the DC/Baltimore area.,,0
baltimore-washington-airport,Geoffrey Atkinson,,BWI and Dulles are roughly equal in the number of passengers served they differ by under 2% and I am not sure which is busier. BWI is great to fly out of. Traffic in the BAlt/Wash area is pretty bad in general so it can be a chore getting to it from NoVa. However from my place in Baltimore I can get to Philly faster than I can get to Dulles in even moderate traffic - but I am 10 minutes from BWI so that pretty much sums up my airport choice! Easy departures is BWI's strong point. The terminal is pretty well laid out and very accesible Light Rail and train to Baltimore train to Washington. Baggage claim at BWI is a nightmare - perhaps the slowest in the US. However Dulles has those crappy trams between terminals this alone makes BWI superior - even if it takes you 30 minutes extra to get to BWI v Dulles you can make up the time right there. Of the three airports it is hard to say which is best as I said before traffic can be horrendous skewing the equation. One thing is for sure if Baltimore is your destination Dulles is out.,,0
baltimore-washington-airport,Robert Clark,,I find BWI to be a great alternative to IAD. I've flown in here internationally a number of times and consider it the best starting point for US travels. The airport has gone through a number of renovations and there was still construction going on near the International terminal last time I was there in Jan 06. The airport is very well-kept and the bathrooms are immaculate. One thing that could be improved at BWI would be to extend the hours of some of the kiosks past security. I had a late night flight to Germany and nothing was open - it made for a very long night doing nothing.,,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,K Pascoe,Australia,Much better than the last time I visited. Three times as big and four more bathroom stalls. Although the bathrooms are now new there are still huge lines for them and they are still constantly covered in water. Only one food option and of course there is a long line. Limited internet access I couldn't connect at all. No real shopping options or TV's extra. Take everything you need with you and consider taking a proper stopover if you transit time is a long one. The city is lovely and worth a visit.,6,1
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,A Steele,United Kingdom,Freezing cold a/c running too cold. Currently wearing 5 layers and an airline blanket but got frozen nose. Need some better food options (to warm me up!) oh and all the withheld weapons from security were available on a help yourself basis at (unstaffed) security before you board your flight.,2,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,M Riddell,Australia,"Nothing more than a shed in Jan 2015 still undergoing renovations. No duty free to speak of (a small perfume counter and some t-shirts and destination trinkets) - definitely no cigarettes but then no smoking room either!! Coffee shop is tiny and despite other information here on this website there was no ""free wireless"" at the coffee shop and thus there is no Internet connection at the airport at all. Do all you can to minimise your transit here better still don't stop here.",1,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,M Bertram,Australia,While this airport is being renovated I wouldn't recommend spending too much time here. The check in area is lovely and spacious but then you travel to an older section to go through immigration and get to the gates. The bathrooms were awful I even contemplated just waiting until we got onto the plane. There is only one cafe which isn't great - expensive and ordinary food cash only. Once the renovations are finished I think this will be a nice airport but for the moment spend as little time here as possible.,3,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,Liam Moulton,Indonesia,"Disgraceful. That's the best way to describe this airport. Only thing going for it is transit times are short. Everything else is appalling. Renovations are along way from completion but apart from a sorry excuse for a coffee house and little ""shop"" that doesn't even sell obvious things like confectionery there are literally no facilities here. The cafe doesn't even sell coke or sprite. Overall a sorry excuse for an airport and a complete embarrassment to Brunei. The Sultan needs to get his act together and order the airport authorities to get their act together. Only transit here if you have serious financial troubles and can save a fortune by flying Royal Brunei otherwise avoid at all costs.",1,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,Carolyn Brown,Australia,Does anyone know if the first stage of redevelopment is completed? I was there in August and although the airport was small and under going work it was clean and the staff were very friendly. The only thing missing was a smoking room so would love to know if they have opened one yet.,9,1
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,J Quinto,United Kingdom,BWN is a small airport currently being upgraded into a larger facility. The current situation is terrible. The check-in area is too small even for the modest number of flights. There were bottlenecks at check-in and at immigration. I didn't have time to check out the few small shops or the dining options.,,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,Scott Waterfall,Australia,There are major alterations at Bandar Seri Begawan airport. They are enlarging by double the size. Some allowance must be made for this but the organisation was good. There is a total different section for business class passengers to check in which is a great idea. Will be an excellent airport after renovations.,9,1
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,M Knezovic,Malaysia,"This airport makes very little sense and it would appear that some of its operational standards are in violation of IATA codes. I can live with the tiny size (not unlike a small-town bus station) and near-total lack of food outlets entertainment or newsagents. But every time I'm leaving Brunei and trying to check in for a flight I am met with locked doors and need to 'figure out' how to gain access to the check-in area. Sometimes ground staff won't even let passengers into the building until the last minute. Once you are allowed in right away you will find yourself walking through a metal detector with your luggage trolley. On my last trip my flight to Brunei was delayed because ""VIP movements"" apparently necessitated the closure of the entire airport terminal for several hours. For the return journey my departure time coincided with Friday prayers which meant all shops were closed from 12pm to 2pm.",2,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,James Halley,Thailand,With only 55 minutes to connect in BWN I wasn't sure what to expect as this is usually below the minimum time for most carriers. I need not have worried as I haven't seen an airport this small in decades. Despite most passengers being in transit as well security was a breeze and I went straight to the gate as the connecting flight was already boarding. From what I saw the airport didn't have a lot to offer but they say that they are refurbishing at the moment (whatever that means?). Most of the pax seem to be flying to Melbourne and with the savings made the lack of facilities at BWN didn't appear to be an issue for them.,6,1
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,S Fitzpatrick,Australia,We read the reviews and got some Brunei money before leaving but the small restaurant took credit card. Yes it is small the toilets are fair at best but overall not too bad and we had a 4 and 3 hour transits. The restaurant provides free wifi at end of the terminal which was slow but did work. A couple of duty free shops a couple of souvenir shops and about 3 food spots. Be warned about the tour touts if you are just transiting.,6,1
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,Scott Waterfall,Australia,Good airport but very small by international standard. Which is an advantage in that you don't have far to walk. As there is no alcohol in Brunei there is also no alcohol at the airport. There is no duty free that I can see.,8,1
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,Pam Hallett,Australia,Wish I had read this info prior to my two recent transit stops at Brunei. The facilities are very poor particularly the unclean toilets. I fail to understand how a wealthy country can possibly offer facilities such as these to potential tourists. Such a shame Royal Brunei doesn't have an alternative airport facility as I would have flown with them again but not while they are connected to this airport. I also had problems with duty free goods I had purchased in Dubai. The security officials stated that Australia was very strict and I would not be able to take the goods back home when I know I could take them in.,4,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,G Miller,Australia,Travelled again with Royal Brunei (Brisbane-Brunei-Manila return) this month and found a vast improvement in this airport. Both the male and female toilets were certainly a lot cleaner than the disgraceful condition that we found in March. The general appearance is also improved.,4,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,M Smith,New Zealand,This airport is small with limited facilities. The toilets are dirty and the shower facilities are bad. Airport staff were unhelpful and only interested in selling you city tours which were expensive. The shops don't accept cards so it is best to take currency that you can change at the airport exchange bureau albeit at an unfavourable rate. If you are due to spend 11 hours in transit like myself it would be best to book a transit hotel or at least take the 2 hour city tour.,1,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,G Miller,Australia,I travelled with my partner to Manila from Brisbane via Brunei last Feb/March. The airport was second rate for an international stopover. The toilets in particular were a absolute disgrace. Mr R Seaman states that on his recent visit things were vastly improved and we look forward to that when we arrive there again this month.,3,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,Ronald Seaman,Australia,My wife and I have flown with Royal Brunei many times over the last 15 yrs and transited at Bandar Seri Begawan airport. The conditions and service at the airport have been pretty bad to awful over that time disgraceful toilets and attitude of staff left a lot to be desired. However the place has been revamped and on our visit there in Jul what a change clean toilets helpful and caring staff new seating no fish tank Royal Brunei should be congratulated on the changes made.,5,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,Graham Cox,United Kingdom,The transit lounge would be acceptable if it were nit for the dirty toilets. Go before you land. The country is rich. can't they even afford a toilet cleaner. My card would not work in the cafe. A Brunei citizen behind me simply paid for me. That is hospitality.,2,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,S Darlow,Canada,Spent about 4 hours here on a stopover between MEL and BKK. Was less than pleased to be stuck in a tiny international terminal with nothing open except for a coffee shop on the mezzanine until about an hour before our flight. Our gate number was not posted until it was almost time to board even then it was still changed which provided a minor inconvenience. The only thing that could compensate for our experience at BWN was the lovely experiences we had with Royal Brunei Airlines it's a shame such a great airline is hubbed out of such a shoddy airport.,2,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,C Stride,Australia,I also had a very nice bottle of Polish vodka confiscated while in transit. They claimed that Australian customs would not let me in with alcohol purchased overseas. I have since checked with Australian customs and there is no problem with bringing alcohol in within the Australian limit from anywhere in the world.,1,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,S Ryan,Australia,Nothing to do here. A clean little airport except the toilets. I believe the airport is to be revamped - given the wealth of the country its surprising it hasn't been done sooner! If there for a long transit then head out of the airport for a look around if there for a couple of hours take a book.,3,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,C Smith,,Spent 11 hours at the airport - en route to LHR from Auckland via Dubai and Brunei. The airport is very small and basic (ladies toilets not the best - two normal loos and two holes in the floor). There are free showers (can hire towels) but only have cold water! Shops consist of couple of snack/food shops and couple of souvenir/jewellery shops - can look round them in 15 mins. If you are there during the day - best idea is to book yourselves a city tour with Royal Brunei Airlines desk - staff more helpful (able to pay on credit card via their city office) better value than other desk in terminal building (more expensive and would only take cash - no credit cards!) We spent 5 hours on city tour - fantastic! Shown around 2 museums sultan's palace mosque houses on stilts local market local shopping precinct - running commentary from a very bright enthusiastic tour guide.,3,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,P Harpin,,Tiny airport but plenty of seats which are comfortable. 2 cafes and a variety of gift shops. Please note that as well as no alcohol you cannot purchase cigarettes at this airport. No problem taking 2 bottles of wine into country - you just need to fill in the orange forms in reception but beware - you really need to look for them.,3,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,Michael Fadjar,,Had 2 quick transits at this airport (less than 30 minutes) on return flights between Jakarta and Kota Kinabalu. No problem with a bottle of Glennfiddich whisky that I did not even bother to take out of my hand carry when passing the No 1 gate security. I can see that it's a bit boring but for a small airport that it is I find service is not bad - I even feel that the place is a bit cozy for relaxing but not for too long.,3,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,Jim Lewis,,"Transitted this airport twice - as we stepped into the terminal we had people all over us offering a free city tour. Once we said we would go them they wanted to charge $66 for the 'free"" tour. Having working in airport security I was amazed at some of the goings ons there. People allowed to wear hats through the metal detector walk through. Children in Prams/ push chairs pushed through the detector instead of the child being taken out and the chair put through the x ray. Airport was clean free internet large seating area very limited shopping. Returning to this airport after Singapore Changi was a huge culture shock.",2,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,J Garner,,I had a short holiday in KL and bought a duty free bottle for my return to Brisbane. While in transit in Brunei my bottle of alcohol was confiscated as I went through security even though it was completely sealed in the anti tamper proof packaging. I will not fly Royal Brunei again nor want to visit their country as they have no idea how to treat or respect people from other nations. To me it looked like they want to remove alcohol because they don't drink it. This is a major scam for booze to be sold on the black market most likely.,1,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,P Olliver,,A nice little airport clean and tidy a coffee shop with free Wifi and 2 free internet booths if you buy a drink - turn left and up the stairs there is an internet cafe souvenir shop duty free snack shop showers another coffee shop round the corner and is a free city tour to pass the time. If you enter Brunei its very quick bring some Singapore cash or Brunei dollars to avoid money changing if you need a Visa bus to city is $1 only they're smaller purple busses taxis outside but negotiate the price first. Be warned they will confiscate liquids if you are in transit so don't buy duty free until you arrive at your destination unless you enter the country just fill out a customs form and bring it in. Also a smoking room clean toilets and plenty of seats.,4,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,W Hughes,,"A warning for Australians arriving into Brunei: unlike almost all other nationalities you will be charged B$20 for an arrival visa and if you have no Brunei currency on you (as I didn't) the only option is to use a money changer at extremely poor exchange rates; the only ATM's are outside the security area. Apart from this the airport is not bad; the Skylounge upstairs for business pax is quite pleasant (apart from being ""dry"" of course).",3,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,A Woodgate,,No words can describe the utter intransigence and lack of good will that this airport's personnel showed us. My wife and I were in transit (not even in the country) from Perth to Kota Kinabalu. We were asked to open our hand luggage after going through a scanner. Out came the duty free bag with our two bottles. But because someone at Perth had not sealed the bag properly all was lost (confiscated) by a very officious officer. She could see that it was duty free still with the seals and packing around them intact but chose not to and they were whisked away. Needless to say we will not be visiting Brunei for any holidays nor using Royal Brunei Airlines for any flights. Poor Airport good will Poor representation of the country and a poor way to attract visitors. So make sure your duty free is properly sealed if travelling to or through this destination.,1,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,Paul Knight,,It is not a large airport so not very busy. In the Transit lounge it is quite spacious with a couple of small shops selling things from sweets and chocolate to magazines and even t- shirts the place is airconditioned there is an upper lounge area for business and first class called the sky lounge a cafe called cafe on a mezzanine which overlooks the transit lounge - it also has free WI-FI but there is also an internet cafe below which charges around $5 brunei dollars. There are sockets dotted around the lounge area and these are three pin just like the UK ideal to run the laptop. There is a money exchange in the main transit area and to try and work out what the dollar is against products a kit kat was $1.00. Two small lattes from the bean cafe came to roughly $9.50 not the cheapest but will not break the bank. The place is very clean and there are showers available for a cost (unknown). If you head out of the airport there is duty free shops and if you are in transit for a few hours we were offered a free tour of the city but was told the day visa would cost around $10.00. Be aware if you are staying in Brunei do not take more than two bottles of spirits duty free. as these will be confiscated.,3,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,J Bennetto,,Very boring air terminal. Food retail shops are minimal. The place lacks character. Spending a couple of hours or more there is very testing particularly in summer as the terminal appears to be lacking air conditioning,2,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,Ken Chan,,BWN is not really the airport you should spend much time in. Not much to do there shopping is not value for money and there is little place for wandering around. If you are in transit more than 3 hours in Brunei take a day trip instead rather than sleeping in the airport.,2,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,G Ryle,,Visited this airport on my journey from London to Perth. Its not that bad - there isn't much to do but the staff I encountered were friendly enough and the lounge was tidy and clean. You wont want to be there too long but its an airport - when do you ever want to be at one too long??,3,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,Edmund Carew,,A dreary airport that is showing its 33 year old age. Even the tropical fish tank lacked the illustrated number of species. Upon transiting between SIN and SYD with a five and a half hour stopover I paid $25 for an unexciting city tour. At 2000hrs passengers were called to the departure lounge for the 2105 BI flight to SYD. After placing our handcarry through the X-Ray machine transit passengers - about 15 to 20 - all had duty free liqour purchased at airports such as SIN and DXB confiscated. Many passengers repeatedly argued with the airport police and a so- called 'supervisor' to no avail. I spoke later with a senior staff member of Royal Brunei Airlines who claimed he had not heard of dutyfree liqour being confiscated but agreed that it was exempt from the February 2007 introduction at many airports of a '100ml individual one litre total' rule for handcarry liquids aerosols and gels. No RBA staff member offered to assist at Brunei Airport. The airline has since informed me that it is receiving many complaints from passengers and that those affected should write to it whereby claims will be forwarded to its Brunei head office for consideration for compensation. The arrogant Brunei Airport staff claimed that the liquor bottles would be broken : some wags interpreted this to mean the seals would be broken in private parties or that the liqour would be resold on the black market. One English couple lost an expensive bottle of Scotch and as usual many passengers were purchasing liqour as gifts for relatives and friends not for their personal consumption. Presumably this scam occurs with every flight that has transit passengers. It must net such officials a veritable mountain of spirits each year. Avoid this airport should you have purchased duty free liqour elsewhere. I did not observe whether cigarettes or perfumes were similarly confiscated.,1,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,K Morris,,Boring dull lifeless draining miserable. A very below average airport. Has nothing to offer. Business class though clean and ok bathroom facilities is generally uncomfortable with hard seats useless staff horrible food and not somewhere you want to be stuck for very long. Safety and cleanliness ok but for luxury travellers you'll be bored as hell and will not be too impressed. Expect delays. With fair rating I am being generous.,2,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,Jenny Bentley,,"Used BSB airport twice during July: business lounge is nothing special although the staff are very helpful. Food is limited as are shower and toilet facilities. There's the option of a transit tour if you have 6+ hours to spare but be warned: city tour is of little interest: we ""visited"" the palace by parking across the road and seeing the dome among tree tops! Visiting the water village is much more interesting but if you're an animal lover don't go: the caged cats and monkeys are a sorry sight.",,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,Carl Townsend,,The airport is small and departure and arrivals are on the same level. Airport duty free has no alcohol it does have the best range of chocolate and at excellent prices. Only major hassle we had was that immigration open at scheduled times so had to wait for an hour till immigration opened before reaching departure area and transit in a hurry not recommend. The security sticker put on your bags are impossible to get off - a bit petty I know but be warned.,,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,Andreas Kasner,,The airport is small and user-friendly. It took us merely 20 minutes from docking at one of the (five) fingers collecting our luggage immigration customs search for an ATM (which are located at the departure level) up to leaving the airport. Drawback are the taxies - they deny the officially posted rates and charge about 30% more. Departure was also smooth with the exception that they checked weight and size of all hand luggage which caused some kind of queue. Used BI's lounge very comprehensive range of food and beverages and only 20 metres from the gates.,,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,Mal Elbon,,"Whilst some of what Ross said is true I found it to be efficient and no undue ""Rules and Regs"" Staff seemed friendly and not overly officious. I have been many times and never found the type of religious discrimination Ross talks about. I have stayed overnight in the transit lounge and found it to be well priced for what you get (and whay you save going into town). As airports go it is a safe efficient small Airport.",,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,Ross McKay,,The two food outlets are expensive and food choice is very poor. The smaller hole in the wall outlet has friendly staff but the other one has indifferent (at best) service and a miniscule range of food. If you are a Muslim then you will get free snacks at about 2pm however there are no favours for other religions. The dayrooms cost about $50Aus for 8 hours and are rather prison-like but you can have a bath. You have to go through customs to access the ATM so if you have a layover make sure you bring in money. The duty-free is quite expensive. I would rate this airport as poor albeit safe.,,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,Hugues Martel,,The airport is relatively small but modern. Facilities are good and the airport is clean. There are few duty free shops but the selection is limited as no alcohol is sold in Brunei. Overall a nice and user friendly airport.,,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,Peter Buick,,The airport is extremely small with virtually no facilities. There are about four small duty free shops all with an extremely limited range of products - chocolate perfume and cigarettes. Due to Brunei being an Islamic state there is no alcohol for sale in any form duty free or otherwise. There is also no viewing deck or outside access.,,0
bandar-seri-begawan-airport,Hiro Suda,,Very basic. The terminal is pretty old and there aren't many facilities to speak of. Few shops (only one in departure lounge couple gift shops before immigration) restaurants. Though being a small airport one good thing is the time it takes to board from check-in. I arrived at the airport 30 min before the departure and had no problem to get on the plane - even for international flights!,,0
bandung-airport,Aldo Samulo,Indonesia,Husein Sastranegara Airport in Bandung West Java Indonesia is very small and very narrow and does not deserve to be an international airport. Besides smaller and less clean toilets. The most severe and the entrance to the airport is very small and so is the waiting room is very small and result in chaos when passengers crowded. Besides the entrance to the plane and the stairs are very narrow so it is difficult to walk and the airport are very uncomfortable.,5,0
baneasa-airport,A Wild,United Kingdom,Returned from a short break in Romania. On arrival you are forced to queue in a small hot dirty room to pass through security. You walk into the baggage collection which consists of a small room with the smallest conveyor belt of any airport I've seen. Once you have retrieved your luggage you walk past a small desk which I think was customs you are then outside and ready to be hassled by numerous dodgy taxi drivers. When departing from Baneasa ensure you arrive early as the queues are appalling. Our flight had 2 check-in desks but only one was open. Long queues to get through security before the departure lounge. There are 4 doors onto the runway and 3 or 4 screens which are impossible to read. There is a small shop in the lounge although it doesn't accept Romanian currency. Small cafe and a smoking room that holds 6-8 people standing. Didn't see a cleaner during my 3 hours in the airport and it shows.,1,0
baneasa-airport,N Gagnebin,France,"The Airport didn't have someone who could speak English at the information desk. The ""info- desk"" should really employ someone being able to understand and speak English as most of destinations are outside Romania and the traveling language in Europe is actually English. The Airport has no possibility to buy and stamps so if you intend to write postcards and buy the stamps at the Airport forget it. The organisation is quite awful. The 3 queue lines are clearly written but besides having a queue for Crew the non-EU isn't really useful as all planes leaves for a Eu destination. It's small and the boarding gates are not clearly shown. You must figure out by yourself if the bus you just popped in will actually bring you to the correct plane on the tarmac!",1,0
baneasa-airport,Daniel Nunes,Romania,I use this airport quite frequently. The airport has only 2 rooms - One where are located all the waiting places information booths and about 8 check-ins. The other room the boarding room is not much bigger and has 4 gates and no information whatsoever you just have to figure out for yourself which one is your gate. Overcrowded filthy and dangerous due the the large amount of pickpockets.,1,0
baneasa-airport,W Drennan,,I've been to quite a few airports in my time but have never experienced anything like the chaos at check-in for the Blue Air flight to London I went on this morning: a completely disordered queuing system and some sort of computer failure but they weren't doing announcements about what was going on in English although I asked them politely to do so. Also despite this it took them ages to get a second line going for the London flight although there were two lines for other destinations. This all resulted in the flight being about an hour and a half late. This airport badly needs modernising (or replacing!).,1,0
bangalore-airport,Adhith Shanmugasundaram,Italy,"I have flown through this airport several times, every time I arrive the Immigrations is quite fast along with the baggage claim. The only thing they lack is with the shopping space inside the airport and the really complicated wifi service which must be upgraded.",7,1
bangalore-airport,R Setlur,United States,"BLR just completed a 2-year expansion process to bring its capacity up to 15 million passengers annually. The airport has already reached that capacity and needs to do it all over again to keep up with its 15% growth rate. Between September 2014 and March 2015 six international arrival and six departure experiences all business class and all good. At departure lines to enter the airport with e-ticket in hand as the entry pass were fair to excellent check-in for business class was almost instantaneous emigration counters were fully manned and moved quickly security was slightly chaotic but times were fair to good. Lounges were good to excellent. At arrival immigration wait times were at most a few minutes the entry hand baggage security check was a fairly quick joke cumbersome and wasted 3-4 minutes; except on one occasion luggage arrived reliably within 15 minutes of our arriving at the belt. Customs was always a wave through no matter how much luggage I had. From aircraft seat to taxi door the time required was between 30 and 45 minutes except on one occasion when my ""priority"" bags were the last 3 on the luggage belt. Taxi lines were properly policed to prevent queue jumping and on one occasion cleared a line of more than 150 people in 20 minutes. In sum a better experience than most airports I use.",8,1
bangalore-airport,S Sankar,United Kingdom,Surprised by some of the comments here - especially describing the terminal as a tin shed. I've flown in and out of BLR both on domestic and international flights several times and I find the terminal building to be light airy and very pleasant. My domestic experience is first rate. Our bags are always out within 5 mins of arriving at the belt - never the case in the UK or the 'Western' world. Departure - numerous security lines and clear signage plenty of shops and restaurants. Genuinely no complaints. International - arrival security check is cumbersome and time consuming and the immigration process can be bureaucratic but after that the bags are out quickly and getting a cab is safe easy and well priced. Departure - easy security and immigration. Only complaint is there are not enough seats in peak hour. Other than that it is an 8/10 international airport.,8,1
bangalore-airport,Tanya Benny,India,Bad. My family and I are frequent flyers to the Middle East. And among the 3 Indian Airports used by us (Mangalore Bangalore Mumbai) Bangalore seems to be the worst in terms of service. I have no complaints regarding the infrastructure however the staff I've dealt with in Bangalore are the just too uncivil. My mother has had bad experiences with the immigration staff a couple of times. Extremely rude and arrogant. I have had my share of experiences. I would have avoided using Bangalore International Airport if I could help it. Unfortunately it is the most convenient considering I live here. One thing for sure BIAL has spoilt the reputation of Bangalore among all tourists who have dealt with BIAL.,3,0
bangalore-airport,Paul Harrington,United States,The airport is located in what can best be described as a tin shed. There was no skybridge and no bus - they actually made us walk for a hundred yards in the dark to reach the 'terminal'. I don't have to mention that everyone from the ground staff to the guys unloading the luggage were rudely asking us for money all the way through. The arrival hall was a disaster. We were herded through like cattle past passport control and customs - the fact that they took their time shaking down each and every of the foreign passengers for money didn't make the queue go any faster. There was no AC in the hall and no ventilation either. Speaking of queues - the Indian passengers didn't seem to know what that was and crowded the counters in spite of protests from the foreigners in line. Baggage pickup was in a dinghy hall where our stuff was just dumped in the middle in a huge heap leaving us to pull it out by ourselves. There was no security and no order at all. From the outside the airport tried its best to exude a modern facade with a sweeping roof apparently built at great expense by an American company and it did succeed even though the roof was badly maintained and falling apart in places. But it did not make up for the fact that this was one place you really do not want to fly through. Period.,,0
bangalore-airport,Vijayakumar Arumugam,Australia,I recently flew in to Bangalore from Sydney through Cathay Pacific / Dragonair. Then after a few days I used this airport for the Bangalore - Chennai domestic leg via Jet airways as well. The airport has got good facilities and offers a reasonable first impression of the city. All the immigration counters were open and it helped the passengers to move out of the section quickly. However the space between the steps / escalator leading to the immigration hall and the counters is not large enough which makes the queuing a bit difficult than it should otherwise. The on-arrival visa counter had good signage with helpful attendant being present. The customs was a breeze and the carousel worked adequately well. Unlike most Indian airports getting out of the airport is a pleasant experience since it has got ample space and the cab drivers and other onlookers are kept at an arms length.,7,1
bangalore-airport,Vikas Pal,India,Not so good for shopping shoppers tend to only stop in the domestic terminal compared to Delhi airport where you have various option to shop. Otherwise it is an ok airport with regard to cleanliness and toilet facilities.,7,1
bangalore-airport,A Arora,United Kingdom,I landed in Bangalore on a domestic trip. The luggage arrived promptly and car pick up point was not far from arrival gates. The airport is undergoing huge refurbishment so obviously dirt was flying everywhere. The airport is really at a remote place without much local transport links to the city. There is still no metro link planned for this airport. The departure was fine with medium size queues at security point. The departure lounge has a good variety of food and shopping options. The gates are not far from shopping/food shops. The toilets were ok but they need to construct more cubicles for passengers.,,0
bangalore-airport,Mark William,United States,I arrived at the airport 1 hour and 40 minutes before my domestic flight. It took an hour to check in with Jet Airways in spite of the fact that there were 8 check-in counters open. Then it took 30 minutes to get through security in spite of the fact that every security location was operating. Barely made my flight. It seems like there are way too many passengers for the facilities that they have. Besides that the airport is so far from the city center. The airport itself is modern and clean but the negatives are many.,3,0
bangalore-airport,Rishad Patel,India,Bangalore's new airport seemed disorganised. There is still massive construction work outside. The check in counters seem few and limited. Security was quick but once in the waiting area it seems like a large disorganised shopping mall. The food outlets were plenty but sugar and coffee stations were dirty. The walls and ceilings were peeling with paint which was strange for a new facility. Hyderabad seems to have built a similar airport (in size) and done a far better job of planning it and maintaining it.,6,0
bangalore-airport,Kumar Ganesh,India,Bangalore Airport is a fair distance from the city centre takes an hour early morning otherwise close to one and half hours. That said the airport itself is a pleasant experience fast security checks some shopping stores adequate eating options and a free wi-fi for 4 hours after registering. Some LCC flights still use the bus for boarding. Overall a pleasant experience.,8,1
bangalore-airport,V Sitaraman,India,This airport probably has the worst immigration process among all the airports I have used in India and abroad. The officers are arrogant and seem to enjoy exercising their powers on all Indian passengers They just don't seem to care about the fact that the queue is 50 to 60 deep at each counter at 2am. They don't stop at examining whether you have a visa for the country you are proceeding to. I was asked why I was flying out of Bangalore when I have taken most of my previous flights out of Chennai. Every passenger was being asked for the return ticket which is something that is never asked for in Chennai. I always buy one way tickets because my programme is variable and my departure airport is never fixed in advance. On a previous occasion when I was flying BLR-SIN on a one way ticket I was denied immigration clearance for a long time till I told them that I could open my computer and book a return ticket on the spot. I told them that nowadays even the entry airports at foreign countries don't ask for a return ticket. My explanations seemed to infuriate the officer who started raising his voice and it was only the timely intervention of a senior officer who had come to investigate why the queue was not moving that I finally got through immigration. By contrast the immigration process at Chennai is not only much faster and pleasant but all the above unnecessary questions are never asked.,3,0
bangalore-airport,S Wilson,United Kingdom,Went through the new Bangalore airport returning to UK from India. Had to sit around very sparse holding area for around 8 hours before we got through to check in. Security staff need to learn some manners! Departures lounge is okay once you finally get to it - apart from the fearless low flying sparrows.,2,0
bangalore-airport,P Edelstein,United States,I've just used this airport once but it has much lacking. There was no way to check-in quickly with a huge line to check your bags and get a boarding pass. This took almost 40 minutes. The idea of using check-in kiosks and rapid luggage check-in is not something that is known at this airport. Security was overburdened and slow though courteous. Not any place that you would use willingly.,1,0
bangalore-airport,Jai Padmanabhan,United States,Used the airport 4 times in 1 week. 3 Domestic and 1 International flying out. Airport is easy to navigate. Big expansion in progress. Lot of construction barriers but well managed.,9,1
bangalore-airport,Kennet Foeh,Denmark,We have transferred here once and arrived once. Both very nice experiences. Free wifi for 20 minutes nice places to eat and clean. When transferring we experienced a very long queue for security. Apart from this it is a nice airport.,9,1
bangalore-airport,F Bablanian,Australia,I have been through Bangalore airport four times in the last six years and every time the staff never fail to disgust me. At the many checkpoints especially in Departures most staff members are rude despite our cordial and polite approach with them. I sincerely hope airport officials treat reviews seriously. Foreigners' first contact with countries is at airports and impressions like these remain forever.,4,0
bangalore-airport,J Sullivan,India,I have used this airport numerous times. Upon arrival there are baggage trolleys outside. Spacious separate check-in terminals for international and domestic departures and arrivals. There are two cafes for snacks etc. Gates are large with more culinary options and duty free shops here. Sometimes there is an aerobridge and sometimes just the normal platform and bus to get to the aircraft. Generally good experiences here and no long waiting times.,8,1
bangalore-airport,Meghna Chatterjee,United States,To make a very long story short the new airport is Bangalore has only the looks but absolutely no efficiency and no knowledgeable or helpful staff. I had a 13 hour transit at the airport. There is no transit lounge no place to deposit luggage no airport hotel. I would think that being an airport of international status they would have the above. I had to sit at the Cafe Coffee Day for 13 hours with all my luggage and I was not allowed inside the terminal until 3 hours before check out time. There aren't enough outlets outside or rather none just so that I could have plugged in my laptop. I am sure I am not a unique case. Something has to be done for the above problem.,4,0
bangalore-airport,K Ambrose,United States,The airport is clean with proper and adequate signs in English. The food court has limited but sufficient meal selection. Check-in was simple. Trolley easily available for moving luggage.,4,0
bangalore-airport,Sandeep Sinha,India,Clean and tidy airport. All other features are good except a few things. I was travelling with my wife who is pregnant unfortunately we got to the airport a bit early and I found nowhere for my wide to relax.,3,0
bangalore-airport,D Vassilakis,France,Very good airport immigration took no more than 2 minutes to clear upon departure check-in great and security line very reasonable . Food options could be better.,4,0
bangalore-airport,I Orme,United States,Having gone through the torture of Delhi airport several times the Bangalore airport is night and day. Breezed in breezed out. The waiting areas are a bit crowded for the several international flights [12-3am] but not oppressively so. As noted below I was in business and got there nearly three hours early but the business lounge did not have a single empty seat.,4,0
bangalore-airport,K Varghese,United States,"The facility is nice and clean but seems to be rather small for a city that is the size of Bangalore. The flight to Frankfurt was full and the waiting area was crowded. The immigration were unimpressive as far as PR is concerned but fast processing the paperwork. However the police officers in and around the security check area could speak English fluently. Baggage claim took over 30 minutes. I will give the airport a ""B"" when compared to other International airports.",4,0
bangalore-airport,O Schmidt,Germany,All very nice and modern. However the security guard at the outer entrance seemed unable to read (latin letters). Instead he stared at each document for at least one minute causing a heavy queue. He accepted my e-ticket without even turning it to the front side where the crucial information about name and flight was printed. Business lounge is before the inner security check. After the experience with the outer security checks I guess everybody skips the visit there.,4,0
bangalore-airport,A Muralidharan,India,Now that it's more than a year since the new airport opened the operations have been streamlined a bit. Luggage arrives in the belt almost by the time one reaches the baggage collection area. Check-in fast and efficient. For transport to and from the city the BMTC Vayu Vajra buses are the best bet. Meru Cabs offers a very decent taxi service. Now for the bad part - immigration lines can be really long between 1 and 3 am. The terminal though large seems quite empty. Those spaces have to be filled with chairs for people to sit. There are hardly enough places to sit. There aren't enough food counters. The current food counters are way too expensive. It can cost up to Rs.300 to 500 for a decent breakfast. I think that's atrocious.,4,0
bangalore-airport,Shrikant Rao,India,On the face of it the airport terminal appears to be small but is adequate for the current traffic. There is a quiet small European airport like functional efficiency in the current airport that somehow masks the attendant Indian chaos. Road infrastructure to and from the city vastly improved. The airport will stand tested when traffic volumes rise.,4,0
bangalore-airport,Bharat Rao,United States,Used the BLR airport 4 times in the last 3 weeks - arriving on Lufthansa flying to Delhi and back on Indigo and flying to Mumbai on Kingfisher. Overall experience has been as good or better than when I last used the airport in mid 2009. The relatively compact size of the terminal sometimes makes it appear inadequate but didn't actually encounter a situation of overcrowding - either in the waiting area or elsewhere. Don't think the use of buses for embarking/disembarking is always directly related to any lack of availability of overbridges. Low cost airlines avoid airbridges to save on their usage charges. Airbridges were used on Lufthansa and Kingfisher but not Indigo. Immigration baggage and customs on arrival were very quick. Security lines were on the longer side but not a cause for concern if you arrive about 75 minutes prior to domestic departure. In general baggage handling appears to be pretty efficient. Porter service continues to be helpful and useful. There seem to be more food options within the terminal and outside in the waiting/parking area. Public transportation to the airport seems better and the time taken to city centre in peak traffic seems to average about 90 minutes.,4,0
bangalore-airport,Jeff Singer,United States,While a big improvement over the old airport for a new 21st century airport it is quite bad. There should have 10 times as many gates - most domestic flights still require a bus to get to the aircraft. The business class lounge for international i always full between 1-3 AM when most international flights leave. Why did they build such a small lounge for a new airport? If you are flying business class check in an hour before your flight and board the flight - forget the awful lounges. Immigration lines in arrival can be very long - again pathetic for a new airport.,3,0
bangalore-airport,David Leston,,BLR is very modern clean and efficient - quite unusual for Indian Airports. Facilities are great and for the most part the staff are helpful and friendly. I'd definitely recommend it.,4,0
bangalore-airport,A Swamy,,Arrived from DEL at 2030. Aerobridge for getting off not the usual ladder and bus. Terminal very spacious airy and clean. About 5 min walk to the baggage carousel. Bags were out shortly after reaching the carousel. Baggage carts were available in plenty. Less than 5 min walk to the taxi stand. Departure to DEL at 0615. Since early morning flight check-in and security took only 15 min. Toilets were clean. However the number of seats at the Gate are very limited. One would not be able to get a seat if two international flights are departing at around the same time. Short bus ride from the Gate to the aircraft. Overall a vast improvement from the previous HAL airport.,4,0
bangalore-airport,S Srinivasan,,"First time flying though the new Bangalore airport and I have to say it's not bad. Baggage service was remarkably quick - bags had started appearing on the belts less than two minutes after we walked into the terminal. Much better than the airport in HYD which was built by the same company. On departure there's not much to write home about outside of security. All I could find was a Cafe Coffee Day which served their products at double the price you can get elsewhere in the city. Also beware that you now have to pay a departure fee of Rs. 285 per person which isn't automatically included in the cost of most tickets. Security is efficient and there's a large number of shops up at gate level. The inline security system is also nice as you don't have to put your checked bags through an X-ray machine before going to the counter. Biggest problem with the new airport as is the case with most new ""greenfield"" airports in India is distance to the city center. It's almost 40 km which can mean up to a 2 1/2 hour drive in rush hour traffic.",4,0
bangalore-airport,Rajesh Hamirwasia,,Flew in and out of BLR on domestic and international sectors in the last month. Was very impressed with immigration and baggage service. Was out of the airport within 1/2 hour each time. A vast improvement over the old HAL airport.,4,0
bangalore-airport,Bharat Rao,,It is a vast improvement on its pathetic predecessor. Low cost airlines appear to avoid using the airbridges so arrival into the terminal building was on a bus. Arrival was pleasant: toilets clean and adequate luggage was out in a jiffy and getting ground transportation was hassle free. Departure also pleasant though I suspect this was at least partially because of the 10.25 am departure when few other intl flights leave. The check in area is large and has an international look and feel. Not having to screen bags through Xray before check-in (normal practice in most Indian airports) is a big help. Porter service is efficient professional and reasonable priced (Rs 70 per cart - which is less than $2). Immigration and security check were a breeze because our flight was the only intl one around that time. Immigration staff well turned out and looked more professional. The departure area is not that large and it will I suspect be inadequate if 3-4 flights are bunched together. Announcements were clear and audible.,4,0
bangalore-airport,Jan Elshout,,The tax free shop should inform travellers to Europe better. On May 9 I bought a bottle of whiskey in Bangalore which was confiscated in Frankfurt on my way to Amsterdam. All transfer passengers have again to go through security check at Frankfurt and authorities there only accept sealed bags from European airports. There had been no problem if my journey had ended in Frankfurt.,4,0
bangalore-airport,S Kumar,,"I have used the new Bangalore airport half a dozen times for domestic commutes. No international travel so far. Enjoyed every single visit. Entry to the airport is via a six-lane road which branches off from the Bangalore-Hyderabad highway. Smooth drive all the way to the curb-side drop off. No congestion at all. Check-in was a breeze with plenty of space and no crowding. The very high ceiling gives a feeling of spaciousness and feels really good. Security check was also very quick with no hold-ups. Departure lounge feels crowded with all the retail outlets taking up lions share of the available space. I wish the planners had given an additional fifty feet ""depth"" (i.e. distance from security check to departure gates) to the departure area - that would have eliminated the congestion. Aircon worked well all the time. Announcements were soft but audible. Flight information displays were hard to spot. I spotted them only on my second trip! Departure lounge cafe was excellent for early morning (Indian) breakfast. All my flights departed on time. Boarding was always smooth even when using the bus to get to the aircraft (which happens often given the small number of aero-bridges available). Arrival experience has been superior. Most time I do not check- in any bags and hence I could just walk out. The one time I did check-in a suitcase it came out on the belt just as I reached the belt! Another time a colleague had to pickup his suitcase - less than five minutes wait at the belt. Very clean and well maintained airport (inside and out). I give this one high marks.",4,0
bangalore-airport,Kurt Müller,,"Arrived at 1.30am. First impression is that of a modern airport. Move on and you will realize that they have simply moved the inefficient overcrowded immigration area from the old airport to the new one; immigration officers in rag-tag outfits no uniforms and some with woolly hats pulled down over their heads. Baggage took more than an hour to make it onto the belt - you don't need a new airport for that. We had a four-hour wait for a domestic connection and were refused entry to the departure hall when we showed our e-tickets on our Blackberry screens. Instead we had to go outside get the domestic airline to print out tickets and then re-enter (welcome to Bangalore India's IT capital!). Only coffee outlets open - even the ""Time Out Bar"" in the domestic departure area is not a bar but a mere coffee counter. All in all: why put up a new airport when basic issues such as immigration baggage delivery movement from international to domestic and catering are not addressed properly?",2,0
bangalore-airport,S Sankar,,Used BIAL 4 times within 2 weeks for 3 domestic flights and one international departure. I found the whole experience very good. Everyone cribs about the distance of the new airport to the city centre. Over time people will forget about the old airport and will factor the distance to the new airport into their overall journey. Once the Namma metro is complete the journey will be even more convenient. At the moment one has to travel either by taxi or take the city bus. The city bus transfer is clearly signposted and very efficient with around 8 different routes into the city departing every 20mins or so. My journey to/from Indiranagar took just over an hour on all occasions. The airport itself is finally the first international standard airport in India (I haven't been to the new airport in HYD) with decent shops the Kingfisher bar cafes lots of immigration and security queus and clean tiolets! My personal overall experience was very positive. The only issue I could see was with the size of the international departure lounge. My BA 747 was full and the 350 passengers took up around half of the available seats in the international departure area. I imagine that at around midnight when AF LH TG SQ and KL all operate 777s or A330s that the departure area will be bursting at its seams. From reading the press I understand this has been recognised and they are already talking about extending the airport which will probably take 4-5 years.,4,0
bangalore-airport,S Rao,,I arrived by Lufthansa at 1205 at BIAL. Baggage took over one hour to come. There were seven baggage belts but each belt area had inadequate space for passengers who were waiting. The air conditioner was switched off. It was hot and humid. To reach one's car with driver one had to walk a long distance since private cars were not allowed near the terminal. Signposting outside the terminal was abysmal with no signs indicating exit and direction. The airport charges Rs 70/ for a coolie with trolley. And of course one pays a tip doubling the cost compared to the old airport. There were many immigration desks and it was quick. Customs was practically non-existant.,3,0
bangalore-airport,M Vajpey,,"Used the new Bangalore Airport to depart on an international flight to Paris. This was about 5 days since the new airport was opened for operations. First - getting there: we drove from the west end of town at approximately 10pm (well past the ""rush"" hour) so the experience was pleasant. A minor bottleneck (construction) was the only notable thing which I assume will be resolved pretty soon. Second - at the airport - signage for parking drop-off etc was poor and our driver had to make a few circuits to finally get us to the proper drop-off point. Plenty of people in uniform trying to give directions but better signage would have helped. Terminal - nice new feel to it usual check- in lines. You go up a level for passport control and then security. Both went smoothly with minimal waits. You could almost say the airport appeared overstaffed but this was probably due to complaints of teething troubles in the newspapers in the first few days of operation. Gates/Duty-free: well above the previous airport obviously. Good seating lots of glass nice views and a decent duty- free. Not very price-competitive however. Overall a vast improvement. A modern airport if not a very large one.",4,0
bangalore-airport,G Field,,"Whilst it is very old and tired and very Inndian it just about works. Everyone is excited about the new airport due to open Mar/Apr 2008 but expect that to be a worse experience due to major transport problems getting there. Biggest hassle at Bangalore is guy checking the tickets/paperwork at the main entrance door to the international terminal. I travel on E tickets and I dont always print them off so I often only have my passport and an email on my laptop. First time this happened to me a BA clerk was nearby and ""rescued"" me from this pointless administration. This week I didnt have this help so I wrote the flight details (didnt even have the flight number) on the outside of the envelope I had been given by the hotel with the hotel bill. Guy on the door opened the envelope ""read"" the hotel bill ""checked"" my passport and let me through. Amazing India!",3,0
bangalore-airport,Arun Subramanian,,"I have traveled many a time through Bangalore airport. Most of the findings are true and the facilities are poor. However it may not be correct to directly relate the conditions at airport to the name ""silicon valley of India"". The airport is a very old one and had not foreseen the growth in international traffic. As many of you may know the new international Airport at Bangalore is almost ready with latest facilities which hopefully will satisfy requirements of international passengers. Whereas the rush crowd and zoo like ambience (as described by some) is concerned it may not change much as we have large cross section of travelers (Indians and foreigners) with different background and culture.",3,0
bangalore-airport,Ian Tracey,,I have been travelling through Bangalore airport regularly over the last few years and it never ceases to amaze me how strange and annoying the place is. The facilities are the worst of any airport I have ever been to and checking in is like being in a zoo. Even though some of the airlines try to board their passengers by row this is just not happening. As soon as the first boarding announcement is made expect a stampede. It is almost like they think the plane will leave without them if they don't get on first. The (unofficial) smoking area is in the toilet! Even though carrying matches or lighters onto the plane is not allowed the entrepreneurial toilet attendant will happily light your cigarette for you and steer you to one of the two cubicles. A few rupee tip is expected for this service. Bring your own toilet paper if you need to use the toilet as the airport supply is haphazard to say the least. Make sure you eat before you get there as the single coffee shop is next to hopeless and very much more expensive for the rubbish served than anywhere else in town. The departure area is awful. The seats are filthy and the flight information screen of virtually no use as it is normally several hours behind or showing information on arrivals or domestic departures which go from a different hall. The current airport is however very conveniently located with most places no more than twenty to thirty minutes away. The new airport under construction is going to mean trips of up to two hours for lots of travellers as Bangalores traffic is a disaster all of the time and worse if it rains. After immigration on arrival delays getting to baggage reclaim are caused by your carry on bag being x-rayed and you going through a metal detector. Quite why this is needed when you have just finished your flight is beyond me. Baggage reclaim is slow. Watch out for the farm tractor pulling trolleys of suitcases. When you arrive and walk outside expect to be approached by a multitude of hopefuls wanting to carry your luggage or be your taxi. You can also expect to be quoted outrageous figures for your transport. You know you are being ripped off when you see a cloth placed over the meter. Very few places justify a fee of above 200 Rupees for a taxi or 100 for an autorickshaw. If you are being picked up you will probably have to brave the crowd outside to find them as there is a fee to come inside to meet you and most drivers just won't pay it.,1,0
bangalore-airport,Steve Agnew,,While there may not be much shopping in the conventional sense there is an excellent and serious bookshop better than I've seen in any airport. It is well worth a browse through - you're sure to find a treasure or two.,3,0
bangalore-airport,J Kemp,,Agree with other comments that while Bangalore airport is not Changi it's not the abyss described by many. Having experience explosive growth in the region with a new airport on the way it's amazing that this little military airport holds up under the pressure. There's a special charm about this airport - and while taxed by the increasing number of passengers coming through this tiny facility I think that the airport administration has done a pretty good job. Arriving from Paris at 1 AM I was through customs picked up luggage (after having to wake up the porters who were sleeping on the belt!) and into my car in 30 minutes. On the way out on a mid-afternoon flight from BLR to BOM I was checked in and through security in 10 minutes. While there was no lounge service just sitting in the main waiting area is quite an experience. One does not always have to shop to make an airport experience something to rave about to friends.,4,0
bangalore-airport,Richard Coxon,,Having arrived through Kolkata left India through Bangalore airport. Yes it is old and tired with few facilities but found none of the problems described by people below. No porters trying to get money from you when you arrived (which was around midnight for the 01h55 LH departure). There was only one X-ray machine for hold baggage prior to check-in but no queue when we were there. Check-in itself was run by Lufthansa and superb able to check us through to the final destination. No wait for security and had our luggage tags stamped to show we had been checked. The departure lounge is tiny and the international terminal has only two gates but one is closed so flights board one at a time. Toilets were clean. No lounges of any sort but also no mosquitoes or flies to be seen. This airport will close soon in any case and be replaced by the new BIA in 2008 so I did not expect new features!,2,0
bangalore-airport,Arjun Shankar,,Bangalore for a so-called IT-Capital has an appaling airport. There is basically nothing to do at the airport for the 2-3 hours you wait in order to board your flight. Security check is a pain as the uniformed staff simply insist on checking the same luggage over and over again (I had my laptop bag poked and prodded and checked 4 times over the course of 5 minutes). Also they seem to be paranoid about getting your luggage tags 'stamped'. I had to go through security again because I had not gotten my tags 'stamped' - what a joke. There is no first or business class lounge and the entire departure lounge was filled with pax waiting for the 4 flights to CDG FRA BKK and SIN. There is only one departure gate for international flights and as you can imagine it was a mess when it was time to board. There is no priority boarding for first and business or Star Alliance pax (even though the lady was trying in vain to make the announcement that boarding at that time was only for first and Star Alliance gold card pax). The building is not airconditioned instead there are huge fans blasting air right on top of the people's heads. There is a Coffe Day coffee shop but the prices are crazy (US$5 for a cup of coffee!) and they have a few cookies and bottled water. I suggest not buying anything there. Overall the airport is very shabby and not at all to any international standards - they really need to fix it up soon.,1,0
bangalore-airport,Ira Rahmawati,,I arrived with Jetstar at 3 in the morning. Disappointed to find an international airport that really needs repainting and change of floor tiles. I was lucky that the toilet had running clear water. Got my bags scanned but no officer was watching the screen. Many people slept on the turned-off conveyor belts on the table on the floor everywhere. Prepaid taxi service was ok. Actually they also have airport threecycle taxi but when I tried it they conned me by asking double the meter because it was before 6am. My Indian friend later told me that the rate was 1.5 times the meter between 10pm - 6am. The airport was small and located inside the city so actually it was also rather nicely located. Unlike gigantic airport like Changi or Cengkareng you can actually reach the city on foot.,2,0
bangalore-airport,Y Elhan,,"It helps to have realistic expectations when travelling through Bangalore airport. Yes it is the so-called IT-capital of India but you are not in Delhi or Mumbai. Allow about an hour to get through all the security checkpoints check-in ticket control etc. Things take longer not all airport staff speak English - some can and will not bother to. Rest bathroom shopping facilities will be limited. But if asked nicely people are helpful. Especially if you are a woman traveller with laptop document bag etc. in addition to your luggage there will invariably be someone who helps with your luggage as it goes in and out of numerous security checks. And where goodwill fails Rs. 20 goes a long way. Try to have some small bills with you there are plenty of porters and ""handlers"" who will get you through the check-points fairly smoothly.",,0
bangalore-airport,J Iwan,,Bangalore Airport is as other Indian airports not a place to relax. At night they have a few international flights eg. to BKK FRA and CDG but only one departure gate which means that the small waiting hall is completely overcrowded. Business Class lounges are not existing. You have to pass the usual uncountable check points for everything to keep the huge amount of uniformed staff working. The newest idea of the airport authorities seems to be that they strictly allow now only one piece of hand baggage. So even when Air France accepted my two pieces (Laptop bag and small briefcase) I faced a unpleasant discussion at the security check point together with nearly all other passengers who had two pieces. (Even cameras and hand bags were counted as one piece). Not really that what you might be expect from the worlds IT-capital.,,0
bangalore-airport,Nico Argyris,,Several porters who will get the luggage wherever you are at the conveyor belt at the car at the check in when standing in line. Don’t use them. If you are keep in mind that a salary for a person working as a teacher is rps 3000 a waiter in a restaurant is rps 2000. There is nothing to do at this airport. There is no lounge. For domestic departure the process is as smooth as it can get in India. For international departures you have to wait 500-600m outside the terminal to get past the first security check (it started raining when I stood there) many checks and x-ray and checks again. Finally inside all shops except 1 where closed although there where 5 international planes departing at the same time. There where roughly 1200 people waiting in the same departure lounge at the same time.,,0
bangalore-airport,Christian Terrill,,You will probably be greeted by several porters who will get the luggage out of your car and take in up to check-in for you. There is nothing to do at this airport. It is basically check-in security (which opens at 5am) and then you are in the departure lounge. There is a small duty free shop (with a reasonable selection of alcohol and cigarettes and prices in US$) and one or two souvenir shops in the departure lounge but that's just about it. There is also a (yellow) mobile charging box on the wall to the left of the actual gate. A small coffee shop (Coffee Day) serves coffee soft drinks and snacks. The coffee is very good - quite strong but very nice and great at 5.30 in the morning. There were additional outlets but they were not open when I was there. Snacks were not that great but there were sandwiches cookies and a variety of cakes. The boarding process was laborious. There was one guard who checks your boarding pass and that you have stamped hand baggage (you have to attach a luggage tag to your hand baggage and this gets stamped when you go through security/xray screening) receipts. You then go through secondary screening (random) and tertiary screening (also random) followed by boarding pass processing and finally you get on the plane! Make sure you have mosquito repellant available as there are mosquitos in the check-in area. They also hang around in the departure hall but the fans in there are quite powerful and blow them away. But if you get bitten by them I'd spray or put lotion on before you arrive.,,0
bangalore-airport,Karl Moosbrugger,,Travelled through Bangalore airport twice on domestic flights recently. It's not a world-class airport but both times (around noon) it was not crowded arrival and check-in was quick and efficient and staff helpful and polite. The terminal building is quite old and small but not as dirty as Delhi and some infrastructure improvements would make a big difference.,,0
bangalore-airport,Kurt Müller,,One could be forgiven for not realising that one is at the airport of what is trumpeted as India’s IT capital. Checking in with any airline using Air India’s computer terminals at BLR passengers can forget about obtaining boarding passes to their final destination if their trip involves a transfer at an intermediate point – the system cannot handle anything but the leg departing from Bangalore. The immigration desks have no scanners for swiping machine-readable passports. However there is uniformed personnel in abundance – some of them doing nothing else but checking whether their counterpart a few yards away has placed a stamp in your documents. Where they are really needed these officers do nothing. Boarding a TG flight on 7th August the procedure was a disaster. Instead of providing the announced priority to families with children and those needing special assistance (and then allowing business class passengers on first) the uniformed guard at the gate was happily (yet again) checking for the numerous stamps on boarding passes of anyone who was rude enough to push their way through (and such people are in abundance in India let me tell you). On the infrastructure side matters have deteriorated even further. Last week I witnessed the collapse of a new structure designed to hide the aircon ducts in the domestic terminal burying the Kingfisher check in desk and one of their agents under the debris. At the international departures building buying a visitor’s ticket has become a farce as passengers and visitors are now separated at the front door and have to use separate escalators. And judging by the state of the seats in the international departures lounge I wonder whether the stray dogs that are omnipresent on the apron area are allowed to use the seats during quite periods – it is simply unimaginable that humans could soil cushions to that extent – and even more so that no one seems to realize they need cleaning.,,0
bangkok-don-muang-airport,Nuti Damrongphatr,Thailand,"Domestic Section was undergoing some construction on my departure date. Air conditioning system in departure hall is not working and entire hall is uncomfortably warm. Going to the airport on Friday evening is a difficult task due to traffic, otherwise this airport is user friendly. The building is not too large with just adequate food stall and some shops to buy supply for the journey, then you are at the gate with just a short walk. Sign is clear and there are too few walkways to get lost. Still love this little old charming airport.",8,1
bangkok-don-muang-airport,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,In Departures bit of a messy check-in on Air Asia disorganised queuing plenty queue jumping going on and nobody doing anything about it. Immigration was pretty quick and airside has plenty shopping and eating options though like BKK not especially cheap. Arrivals was a bit of a hike to Immigration but reasonable queue time and not much waiting for luggage. Taxi queuing times were probably the worst part of the experience (30 mins in mid afternoon) but maybe I just hit a bad time.,5,1
bangkok-don-muang-airport,D Jackson,United Kingdom,Yes it's a bit tatty and some of the signs are slightly confusing. There are a good selection of shops and cafes although the restaurant selection is much worse than the new BKK.,6,1
bangkok-don-muang-airport,Mark Thompson,Australia,We travelled through Don Muang several times in September both domestic and international. Check in at Air Asia can be hectic early morning but airport staff open up additional check in kiosks immigration took an average 5 minutes so long as you had filled in and signed your departure slip. Baggage pick up again very efficient within 5 minutes of arriving at the carrousel the flights bags were arriving. Plenty of fast food outlets coffee shops duty free seating at the gate is adequate public announcements in English there are smoking rooms after immigration for those with a craving. Taxis have a 50Baht extra charge but you have a guarantee that the meter will be used  trains station is close by and a bus at 35 baht will take you to the nearest MRT. Its an older airport which shows in certain areas but not the worst in the world.,8,1
bangkok-don-muang-airport,Ronald Smith,Cyprus,While the airport was clean and staff friendly and ease through to gate simple there were no indoor smoking area at all. I had to go all the way back through the check-ins to nearest smoking are outside where there were no facilities food drink or airport information. This is a great shame that the air port treat it's customer with such contempt. The main airport although poor does have handy smoke rooms to stop. If you really care about customer service you to think about all your customers.,,0
bangkok-don-muang-airport,Mark Wilkins,United Kingdom,Using the airport for domestic travel I found it to be excellent. Check-in at Air Asia was done within 5 minutes no queues at security and unusually for an airport a very good selection of eateries and shops airside with non- inflated prices. There's even a 7-11 selling the usual fair for those wanting a cheap snack or drink. The only downside was the bussing in on the return flight from Phuket despite a lot of free airbridges and a subsequent wait of 20 minutes for the bags to arrive.,10,1
bangkok-don-muang-airport,A McNicol,Australia,It was like visiting an old friend again! The check-in area was a little tatty and run down but once through immigration it opened up to plenty of space good seating and runway views. Sufficient choice of restaurants and services and very quiet compared to BKK. Very little queue time and small distances to travel compared to a far gate at BKK. Well recommended for ease of access and ease of usage.,8,1
bangkok-don-muang-airport,P Nunn,United Kingdom,Huge airport not a lot of flights its a joy to use. Only downside was bussed to the plane on departure found that odd with so many empty stands with jetways. Flew out to Singapore with TAA and back in from Phuket with TAA. No lines for check in passport control or security. Lots of seating both air and land side. Good selection of shops and places to eat on international departures. All in all I look forward to the next time I can use this airport.,9,1
bangkok-don-muang-airport,James Halley,Thailand,Had to fly into DMK with Thai Air Asia. This was like visiting an old friend. In the old days DMK always functioned well unlike its new big brother. Now its even better. The domestic area had plenty of fast food eating options at prices better than BKK. Plenty of seating in gate area. Really pleased with what they have done in refurbishing DMK. Now bus connection to Mo Chit BTS station and also shuttles to BKK airport.,10,1
bangkok-don-muang-airport,Indranil Chakrabarty,Australia,Found recent comments on Don Muang very interesting. Used this airport many times in the past when I lived in Bangkok and this was the only airport in town. Back then late night departures were unpleasant. At least a dozen 747s left between 11pm and 1 am. The departure area was packed to capacity. Some staff were stressed to the limit and consequently foul tempered. Immigration staff were rude too!! The airport was a shame. All that seems to have changed for the better. The airport went through an expansion plan in the 80s and grew to be a thoroughly modern airport. Still it couldn't keep pace with traffic growth and overcrowding persisted. The international departures area was great. Great food superb view of the tarmac excellent shopping. Don Muang to its credit never slipped. Just about every airline flew to BKK. I will fly to Suvarnabhumi and will probably never get to see Don Muang again.,8,1
bangkok-don-muang-airport,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,Good to see this airport back in operation. Security was quick and efficient. Check-in on Air Asia was a matter of a few minutes. Plenty shops and eating places both landside and airside. Obviously the airport is huge for the volume of passengers going though it. The worst parts were the somewhat lengthy walks to and from gates and the lengthy and poorly organised Taxi queues which were always a problem with this airport before. Overall a good move for the budget carriers who are using Don Muang and a good service for the passengers.,8,1
bangkok-don-muang-airport,A Snelling,United States,Used DMK twice and was impressed. DMK is light and spacious and has room for growth. Toilets are clean throughout and several food options exist. It's a standard 300 baht or so to get there from the centre of Bangkok. Hopefully ground transport options from DMK to other parts of Thailand will grow. Otherwise we really liked this place.,9,1
bangkok-don-muang-airport,Bob Kimmings,Australia,A 350 baht taxi ride from Suvarnabhumi but found the free shuttle bus for the return trip. Check in immigration etc was well organised. Airside was clean and fresh. Plenty of seating and not too many shops. Nice airport.,8,1
bangkok-don-muang-airport,James Halley,,I use Don Muang whenever possible although Thai keeps playing with their timetable. The central air terminal at lat phrao station is a real plus as nobody uses it! A sign in the subway telling you which exit to take would be useful! The downside is the baggage check on the Bangkok subway. They insist on opening your suitcase but never actually rummage around inside. Check-in at the terminal is swift and Thai staff take care of the bags once you arrive at Don Muang as its already tagged and security sealed on check-in at the terminal. You can now eat airside. Burger king has returned to the departure area. Its either that or get a gold card and use THAI business lounge. If Bangkok is your destination then Don Muang is streaks ahead of the new airport,4,0
bangkok-don-muang-airport,Ch Kraisorn,,The best thing of the reopened domestic airport Don Mueang (DMK) is the vicinity to the city of Bangkok. An improved service was provided by THAI at its City Air Terminal at the Metro Station “Lad Phrao” with check-in facility including free shuttle bus to and from the airport. Besides these nothing was changed! It remains an old small nice domestic terminal. Arrive there check-in go through security check wait just a few minutes at the gate and then take off! On the way back after docking at the gate walk down to the luggage area always only after few minutes you will have your luggage and then ready for Bangkok. Frankly regarding to the departure and arrival procedures the airport fulfils its function hence a five-star-airport.,5,0
bangkok-don-muang-airport,H Bachert,,Used Don Muang twice since its reopening for domestic routes. Couldn't detect any signs of change or improvement over recent years. It's basically just the old domestic terminal with the same ensemble of 2-3 food outlets and a souvenir shop it always had. Check in procedure as usual with the good old x-ray machine for the bigger luggage in front of the check-in area. After security check there's nothing but rows and rows of chairs and a toilet. Transfer from Suvarnabumi is chaotic and can take hours depending on time of day and traffic situation. All in all a place that should have better remained closed once and for all.,2,0
bangkok-don-muang-airport,Jacob Pfleger,,Flew from Don Muang to Phuket in mid April very uninviting and old airport if they are going to be using this airport for long term domestic operations then it needs a facelift. Also note there are absolutely no shops whatsoever after the security check just the gates and toilets.,1,0
bangkok-don-muang-airport,Paul Bruthiaux,,"One of the best kept secrets about BKK Don Muang is the inexpensive food court at the far end of Terminal 2. Start one level up from the lowest arrivals level. Go as far as you can to the southern end of Terminal 2 in the general direction of the Domestic Terminal. Walk past the bookstore on the right and around the 7-11. At the start of the long elevated ""tube"" that leads to the Domestic Terminal you'll see it on the right. It's clearly signed. If you find yourself looking at parked cars instead of the ""tube"" you are in the right spot but on the wrong level. The place is used mostly by Thai airport workers plus a few savvy travelers. It serves a wide range of Thai food so some (though not all) of the food is spice. It uses a coupon system in increments of 5 baht. Buy coupons before you choose your food drink etc. You can eat very well for 30-35 baht. And it really is delicious. A wonderful place if you just arrived and you need a meal before heading for town or if you are catching a no-frills flight that doesn't serve food. I hope they are planning something similar at the new airport.",,0
bangkok-don-muang-airport,J P Tuggener,,I agree with Derek Moore regarding the Taxi situtation on the departure level. Me as a fluent Thai speaker and resident who flies into BKK every week I do take the Taxi's on the upper level but must make it clear to them where I want to go and make sure they operate the meter correctly (I know the fare home so they cannot play tricks on me). However I would strongly discourage people who do not know BKK and who do not speak Thai to take a cab there especially not at night and its needless to say that women should avoid this at all costs. As a matter of fact most crimes against foreigners in Thailand are committed during the Taxi rides to and from the airport.,,0
bangkok-don-muang-airport,Justin Burton,,Reading some of these reviews on Bangkok airport I would like to say that the Taxi booth at arrivals is spot on all very safe and cheap too pay your Baht 300 in my case and thats it. Bad points very few lifts in T1 T2 and when you do find one watch the doors they stay open for about 3 seconds before trying to crush you which you may then find yourself going up and down floors without even getting out. No need to shop around in all the different duty free stores as the airport operates a one price system and other than cigarettes and sprits prices are more expensive than UK duty free. If you fancy a spot out of the way drinks food etc try the little bar upstairs near Burger king they have a outside area too nice at 6am a bit warm at 3pm just be careful about leaving un-checked baggage outside as its not visible.,,0
bangkok-don-muang-airport,Derek Moore,,People recently recommending that it pays to go to departures to pick up a taxi are missing the point. The 'official' taxi desks outside T's 1 & 2 incur a surcharge of thb50 which is less than £1 sterling just over $1 US. The fare downtown on the meter will then be less than a further thb200 or so. Work it out ! Compare that with LHR CDG JFK or the like ! The desk staff record the taxi number and destination so this acts as a security check and deterrent for the driver to not try any tricks. The drivers dropping off upstairs are unregulated and are more likely to refuse to operate the meter and/or to try any of the well known scams some of these guys get up to. Every year people are robbed or worse by airport taxi drivers and whilst I do not imagine that any statistics exist to prove my point my bet is that it will be the unregulated ones who are doing the majority of the offending. The departures option is probably okay for regulars who know where they are going and who can speak a little of the language or for two or more men travelling together but I would not recommend inexperienced visitors especially singles - and certainly not single women - to go this route.,,0
bangkok-don-muang-airport,Jay Birney,,I've also used Don Muang airport several times. Although it's not as pleasant as some other newly opened international airports around the world but I found it fairly convenient. For the airport tax I think most people misunderstand the way it works. If my understanding is correct the Bkk airport tax is not included in the ticket price as other airports do. Which means if you make a connection flight within the airport and don't pass through the immigration you are not paying airport tax at all. Therefore most people feel like they have to pay as much as THB500 upon passing the departure immigration check. I suggest you all ask for the breakdown of taxes upon the purchase of your air ticket instead of getting frustrated with this kind of arrangement. I'm sure that many other airports also work this way.,,0
bangkok-don-muang-airport,John Dunlop,,Travel tip for BKK. Don't wait for a taxi with all the other arriving passengers just walk (or get lift) up to departures (1 floor directly above) and hail a taxi that has dropped off departing passengers. It will save time and you won't get hassled by touts while you are waiting. Also I have found that they will treat you like a local and go off the meter (negotiated fares are almost always more than the meter).,,0
bangkok-don-muang-airport,Masaki Oda,,Bangkok airport has been improved for the past few years. However because of the layout of the terminal it is not a friendly airport for some transfer/transit passengers. I recently flew on a SQ flight from SIN to KIX with a stop at BKK with two small children. We had only 45 minutes stopover in BKK late at night but we were asked to get off the plane with all our belongings walk around 500m go up the stairs go throgh the security and walk 500m again to go back to the same gate (and the boarding has already started). I understand the importance of security but the airport should be a little more family friendly for example not closing the stairways closer to the gate in order to go upstairs for security. Other than that it is a quite good airport.,,0
bangkok-don-muang-airport,R Shea,,Flown into and out of Bangkok Don Muang Airport a couple of times. It's fast and efficient with queing/waiting times for luggage/check in minimal in both directions. It's not to hot to look at but with it's age is expected. Landing and going through the international arrivals exits is a bit overwhelming with some very pushy people trying to push you into there taxis/tours or to other less scrupulous places but if you keep your head down and act as if you know where your going you can generally get through. One tip it's relatively tiny considering but the airport does make a small charge on top of the usual taxi fare for hiring a cab from the taxi rank at international arrivals so just go up one floor and pick one up from the hundreds that drop people off every minute at departures - just a couple of floors up in the lifts. Overall the airport is great if your running through it quickly but not so good if your hanging around for your flight. Airport hotel is ok but I prefer to stay at the Miracle grand (just 5mins down the expressway and much newer/nicer) or the Sofitel Central Plaza to do shopping at the same time.,,0
bangkok-don-muang-airport,Mark Thomson,,Flew in and out of T2 at BKK in the past week. Baggage retrieval and immigration was fast on arrival and we were out of there in no time. We found security checks on departure to be tighter and more in number than in other airports we departed from during our holiday (CNS SIN LHR AMS SYD) but we had no problems with this and all done by staff with a pleasant and efficient approach. A metered taxi between the airport and our hotel in Siam Square cost approx USD$8 an easy and inexpensive option. Yes the opening of the new airport later this year appears timely but for the present Don Muang has all the facilities retail and food outlets one expects to see at an international airport terminal. It serves its purpose. The Thai people are generally pleasant people to deal with and we found travelling in and out of BKK to be a relatively painless experience.,,0
bangkok-don-muang-airport,K Lawrence,,Arrived Bangkok Don Muang Airport from Dubai with a connecting flight to Krabi and returned a few days later. Be warned that if you have just arrived on an international flight and need to connect up to a domestic one you are in for quite a walk. Terminal 1 has no aesthetics - tt does the basics of the job and that's it. The bizarre departure tax requirement was a bit surprising. I found the toilets to be exceptionally clean and shops are ok for souvenirs. Overall not a great airport but then again not amongst the worst either. Anja Lieder's remarks are in my opinion more accurate- especially pertaining to customer service and helpfulness.,,0
bangkok-don-muang-airport,Richard Hatton,,Flew out of T2 in the early hours of 5th November. Found it to be a pleasant experience and not too busy at that time of night. Clean & tidy. Didn't appreciate the over pushy duty free sales assistants. Is every shop King Power? Maybe the new airport will offer more duty free choice.,,0
bangkok-don-muang-airport,Ian Norris,,It's all been said before but BKK needs a massive refit and the new airport can't come quick enough. The worst thing is the complete lack of seating if you can't get into an airline lounge. When the flights depart in the evening and very early morning the airport is crammed with people and you can't even sit down!,,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,H Blumenthal,France,"Endless walks: this is the best way to define this airport. So few conveyor belts that not even worth mentioning. From my Thai domestic flight to my Thai international flight I had to walk well over 1 kilometer (signs mention distance so there is no exageration here) In addition no fast track for business passengers of whatever airline. BKK being one of the busiest airports in the world and tourism being a major industry in Thailand, all this is very shocking.",2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Margot Love,New Zealand,"I transited through this airport on my flight from Dubai to Christchurch. This meant getting off and back on same flight. On arrival we headed to transit and came across airport staff holding a card with our flight number who directed us to a certain area except when we got to that area we got sent back the other way. Very annoying. Only two queues for security checks so took ages. When I showed boarding pass to staff they couldn't see where I was going and rudely asked ""where you going"" once passed security check and at gate further searching of hand luggage this resource would have been better used at having more security X-ray lines open. Unlike other airports there were no shops at gates to buy anything if you wanted something. Getting wifi was impossible.",3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Norman Sutherland,United Kingdom,"I probably pass through BKK once a month. Immigration used to be a major delay but I've not waited more than 10 or 15 minutes over the past year. Baggage delays have never been a problem. Still plenty of touts cluttering up the Arrivals area and I don't like the 'new' taxi system but again it's not much of a delay. Check-In's seem reasonably efficient depending on the airline, but on international flights I always check in early (typically as soon as the check-in opens). Departure Security and Immigration are much better than before, with minimal delays. Seating in the Departures Area away from the Gates is not good, but one level down from the main concourse is much quieter and a good place to kill a couple of hours. Duty Free Shopping is over priced, and electronics are a waste of time - much better deals to be had in town. Bangkok Suvarnabhumi is a better airport than it was a few years ago, but nowhere near as good as Singapore, Hong Kong or Seoul.",6,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Peter Galliger,Thailand,"Almost 10 years on Bangkok airport continues to amaze me as being so middle of the road for Asia. When one compares Hong Kong and Singapore to Bangkok, Suvarnabhumi just comes up short in all areas. Its basically a shopping center for Kings Power outlets with very little comfort space, few toilets and long distances to walk without pedways. There are mostly greasy fast food outlets with few choices of healthy food. To get wifi you have to register at an information booth. Long lineups at immigration of up to 45 minutes make arriving and departing from this airport very disappointing.",5,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,M Sriram,India,"Arrived from Hong Kong on 9th June evening and had a very short time to catch next flight to Chennai. No electronic boards near arrival in terminal as renovation was going on. Walked further down to be directed by Airport personal to wrong side of departure gates. Had to walk back with family almost a kilometre or more just to
make it in time. Security personal did not allow perfume bought at Hong Kong airport and were extremely arrogant in behaviour even though I showed them the receipt, making me lose a couple of hundred US$. Will never take this route even for a flight change.",1,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Will Barnes,United Kingdom,Queuing time when I got to Bangkok was non-existent (been to BKK twice before) waited maybe 10 minutes to go though to baggage belt. Was happy with the result. On the way back it was the same again waited 10 minutes to go though. Maybe it was a quiet period at the airport. Duty free prices were expensive expect to walk a lot and far.,9,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Phillip Nunn,United Kingdom,On arrival longish walk to immigration there is a snake line then you are directed to another line for a passport desk there were many desks but only 4 or 5 open for non Thai. It felt that looking at the arrivals board later that 4 long haul planes arrives almost same time causing some delays but I have had worse waits. It felt that the bags arrived a container at a time so you had a lot of bags appear then a big gap and more appear then a gap with everyone looking at the same bags going round and so on. For departure arrived a bit early for check in already a long line then one person came and started checking people in after 20 mins or so more people drifted in. Security was a breeze to get through passport control however was a repeat in coming in 4 open desks 4 lines pick a line and hope. The duty free shops are very expensive for the gifts I looked at and was glad I got what looked like the same key ring for 70% less in a shopping center. The airport is very modern and clean if they could sort out passport control and the shop prices it could be a top 10 airport.,7,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,M Chia,Australia,"Very poor passenger flow. Signs to TG and other airline lounges very poorly located. Signs are placed where passengers are not likely to see them. Staff give misleading directions. One ""helpful"" guy took me across from Concourse C to EFG although I wanted to go to the lounge in Concourse C. Worse still he abandoned me at EFG area. The Royal Thai Silk Spa and the airport trains were great but cannot compensate for poor basics.",1,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Robert Oxford,United Kingdom,Dreadful queues. My wife went for an extra good-bye to our grand-daughters and oh-so-nearly missed the flight. As they live in Bangkok we have no choice about the airport we use otherwise we would avoid it. Not much hint here of the so-called land of smiles.,,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,O Dominic,Australia,Immigration is much better than my last visit 3 years ago - a breeze on arrival but 20 minutes on departure with a poor hall design leading to crowding and pushing. As before the worst issue is the heavy use of buses instead of airbridges - 17 of my last 20 flights have used buses despite all being on Thai Air widebodies. This really affects its suitability as a transit or business hub and I prefer to avoid it now. Others aren't avoiding it - the terminals were packed and shop service has gone drastically downhill.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Iuliia Klishyna,Ukraine,Me and my husband were shocked by the queuing time! Having arrived at the airport 2.5 hours before the flight (Bangkok-Kiev UIA flight PS 272 16/2/15) we caught our plane at the last minute! Only because we neglected all good manners and elbowed through the crowd of angry passengers at the passport control counter. The queues were horrible! First at the check-in then at the customs control and finally at the passport control. At the latter there were hundreds of people in a complete mess in a narrow corridor with only 3 counters open (out of 10+). The problem was that they gathered together all the international flights! We are frequent travelers but we have never seen such a mess before. We stood in a passport control line for an hour. I wonder how many passengers missed their flights that day.,,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,J Duffus,Thailand,For a time after some of the low cost carriers were moved to Don Mueang airport the queuing times at BKK's Immigration were reduced to reasonable levels. At certain times of the day however they have now become horrendous again. Arriving on a Qatar A380 around lunchtime it took fully 1 hour 40 minutes to get through the Immigration and Customs lines. This is disgraceful. I fully accept that it does not help when two A380s two 777s and two A330s are scheduled to arrive at the West Immigration Hall in the space of less than 30 minutes. That would tax many airports. The real problem is the fact that even in the knowledge that so many passengers arrive at this time not all the desks were manned. Worse the staff who are supposed to help with the snake queuing system only make it worse when they close one or more and usher passengers into other longer queues. This resulted in several near fights. Automatic gates for Thai citizens was supposed to stop this nonsense. It hasn't!,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Graham Pugh,United Kingdom,Wheelchair Assistance. The last 18 months this service ahs changed for departure customers you do not get the chance to buy items in duty free anymore you get 30 mins at a Cafe then wheeled to a Gate with Toilets and no place to buy a drink for 2.5 hours before being collected 5 mins before boarding you are treated like luggage. Myself wife and friends have travelled to Thailand twice or three times a year for 20 years and only in the past 3 years needing wheelchair help this is now the last time we get this treatment and you no longer get purchases in duty free (due to staff) we travel to other wheelchair friendly countries.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,P Rubenstein,Canada,As a regular user of BKK and other airports around the world BKK compares favourably to those airports. It may not be HKG or SIN but it certainly is better than most of the world's airports. Yes there are sometimes delays at immigration during peak arrival and departure times. Name an airport where that is not the case. I have always waited longer than at BKK when entering Canada the USA and many EU gateways. Security check lines move faster at BKK than those airports as well. When there are delays it is because of passengers who still try to bring forbidden items through or who are disorganized. Yes there can be long walks to and from gates but what do people expect at one of the world's largest airports? There are moving walkways escalators elevators wheelchair assistance and little carts to carry those who cannot walk The key advantage of the airport design is that one is not forced to change terminals. Transfers are a fraction of the time and without the hassles of the airports that have multiple terminals. It is easier to travel through BKK than comparably sized airports elsewhere. Airport restaurants are always expensive but BKK's costs are still far below those of airports in other countries. The lack of easy wifi access is a major deficiency but this is typical of most of SE Asia. There are multiple washrooms that are easily accessible and the washrooms are kept clean much cleaner than in the typical European or US airport. When there are problems with crowds it is usually caused by the tourist package flights which dump large amounts of passengers at one time and don't pay to staff up their baggage services. These package flights also fail to provide more than a few check-in counters causing the long lines for some at check-in. BKK gets the job done and the easy access to cheap high quality VIP bus services that can take a passenger to some of the resort destinations such as Hua Hin (-4 hours away) for 300 baht and elsewhere are a plus. The big problem at the airport has always been and continues to be the taxi /lLimousine service. The limos are over priced and the Taxis often refuse to use their meters. The need to fend off the transport mobsters who hang around the arrivals area continues to be annoying. This aspect of the airport does serious damage to Thailand's tourist sector and image. It needs to stopped.,8,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Shane Bagley,Australia,"This is my sixth journey through Survarnabhumi this year and I have been through every corner of the airport. Like many other reviewers I find it a most annoying inconvenient and expensive experience. The ""Duty Free"" shops are very expensive and have obviously swallowed any duty with their greedy pricing: avoid them and buy elsewhere. The airport can be hot and stuffy in certain areas where aircon is inadequate. Airside food outlets are two to three times more expensive than the city e.g. 9baht soda water was 65baht. Better go to family mart outside immigration area where prices are normal. Also note that many flights require a bus ride across the tarmac because of inadequate terminal facilities. Immigration officers are expressionless. Forget taxis. Spend the extra money and book an airport limousine near the luggage carousel. You pay one fee - no rip offs extra cash for tolls and all that other nonsense you get with the (grossly underpaid) taxi drivers. I see little to no improvement since 2006 and recommend Singapore as a transit point to other Thai cities. Unless you need to go to this airport avoid it.",2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,R Bell,Thailand,Ridiculous 1.2 km walk from Domestic-Arrivals gate to the transfer-desks and International-Departures gate no moving-walkways to help the elderly one has a choice of the endless walk past the duty-free shops and fast-food joints or level-3 with it's view of walkways running both ways but which you cannot access! Internet-access always seems to be unobtainable in reality. The early-days shortage of washrooms has now been addressed. The artwork is quite nice.,6,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,A Brain,Australia,Hot Illogical Hot Illogical a lot of walking in circles - from the ground floor you go through a maze of escalators (not interconnecting). Somehow you make it to departures! Did I mention it was hot and then I need to make a comment for the long queues a lot of standing and a lot of waiting. It used to be good when you could clear immigration through different sectors but now are herded like cows through a central gate you are letting yourselves down Thailand! I love Thailand but so disappointing to have this last impression.,1,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,M Boehm,Australia,It has got a little better with some improvements. A spectacular garden which featured the theme of the royal barges was impressive. Shopping looked tempting. Some cafes were not that appealing and some were a bit over crowded. The train connectivity to the city is very good. Within the airport itself there needs to be more lifts between floors.,9,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,I've been a regular traveller (10-15 times/year) through Suvarnabhumi since it opened in 2006. It's a large airport and it's busy - always. Rule #1 - check in early. Rule #2 - if you have to wait for check-in baggage don't expect to be in a taxi less than 1.5 hours after landing. If you manage 45 mins you've done pretty well. Check-in can be slow but that's down to the airlines. (I always check-in online). Most of them seem to have enough counters available and international flights will typically be open 3 hours before Departure and occasionally 4 hours - so check in early. Upstairs Security Screening is usually only a few minutes wait I've never waited more than 10 minutes and I can think of many worse airports in this respect. Immigration both in Arrivals and Departures is poor and can be the longest wait of the trip through the airport but if you've allowed enough time it is what it is - chill and bring a book. The Baggage Hall is big enough belts are well sign posted and the longest I've ever waited on a bag was a Domestic Flight from Chiang Mai (about the same length of time as the flight). 20 mins in the baggage hall would be more typical. You very rarely get stopped in Customs and queuing times for taxi's is not bad. If you have to wait around there are plenty lounges Airside and seating in the lower levels both Landside and Airside. The Terminal Hotels are expensive and there are better options locally or in the city. Food is expensive and the choice isn't great but there is a food court Landside which is good value. (Burger King seems the busiest eating place). I rarely bother with Duty Free Shopping in BKK - I can shop better in the city. Distances to and from the gates are lengthy in some cases but they're pretty good at keeping the travelators working. Toilet cleanliness may not be at the standards of the best airports but they are cleaned regularly. Signs are OK and Flight Information Screens are very good. Touts still congregate in Arrivals and I still ignore them. The Airport Rail Link isn't the blast to and from the city which was envisioned but it works adequately. Unfortunately it's pretty overcrowded at peak times because of stops at intermediate stations. BKK is a better airport than it was 5 years ago but the Immigration 'experience' is poor and is a major bottleneck. Security is much better organised than before and the budget airlines moving to Don Mueang has taken some pressure off BKK. Given the space they have and passenger numbers they handle BKK should be a better airport than it is and as a passenger it's not a good airport to be in a hurry to get through. Lots of problems go away given enough time.,5,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,S Hogan,United Kingdom,Terrible experience all round shame on them to treat people worse than cattle. Horrendous queue's at security and passport control with the latter having only half the desks staffed. It is the same arriving as well as leaving be warned avoid if possible!,,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,K Walton,United Kingdom,My worst airport experience. Took us 1 hr 30 mins to go through security on departure just five stations open and hundreds of people queuing. It's clear those in charge don't care about their customers. Airlines and any business in the tourist industry take note this will affect your business we certainly won't be coming back.,,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Richard Turnley,Dominican Republic,I am creeping into my mid seventies now and I have found the business class flying in most airlines has improved over the past decade but the airports are becoming more and more of a nightmare every year. Taking the cake is this dreadful Suvarnabhumi Airport which stretches over a vast distance and has many areas without the walking machines. The distances are simply too long for many senior travellors and after more than a kilometre you arrive at the long queues at immigration and afterwards have to fight through crowds and up and down escalators to arrive at taxi lines. Hong Kong is only marginally better and in fact why do none of the airports give some attention to passengers who are getting on in years. I really detest the walking in BKK.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Van Hiep Hoang,Vietnam,This airport is huge and we had to walk about 1100 m to transfer station. Yes it is exact 1100 m from C5 to E2. Before we can get to the transfer desk which is now located on the departure floor we had to pass the security control and without the boarding pass they do not let you in! It is horrible to find something to prove that you want to go to the transfer desk to get the boarding pass! How can someone keep changing the arrangement of the airport at least 10 times over the past 10 years.,3,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Stephen Reynolds,Australia,Very disappointed. There is a serious lack of seating around gates D1-D8. I am seeing whole families sitting on the floor I also am sitting on the floor. Thailand reliance on tourism will be affected by the small thing its services fail to deliver while the rest of the world gets better at service the leader is failing.,5,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Farouk Mogheth,Thailand,"Departure from and returning to Bangkok from Hong Kong. I did mention that the airport is finally listening as there are some minor changes however compared to other airports in the region it is not a comfortable event leaving or arriving at this airport. Passport control is much better than before however waiting times remain longer than optimal and the overall ""attitude"" of the border officers (male and female) can be described as miserable and lacking tact in many ways. Being 10 years here I never touched the glorified tax free shopping as items are pricier than in the city. It's just not worth it at all. Food venues are pricey however there is a food court with great food on the ground floor before you pass immigration to the restricted air side. Walking distances are very long and I cannot imagine older passengers going all that way to reach passport control. Wifi never really worked so I am wondering whether its just for show. The train to the airport from the city discontinued the red express line for some reason (it had terrible frequencies as well - every 45 minutes so it beats the overall idea of having an express train). The local blue line is alright but used by many locals on the way so gets very packed and full in just a couple of stops. My main anger with this airport is its inability to control taxi drivers. They are wilder every time. Once you are seated and left the cab booth many tourists are faced with immediate requests of a set fare that is double or triple the taxi-meter price. In several occasions people were ""offloaded"" close to the highway as a result. I discernibly see those cab drivers getting to be a problem. If you only transit then I really suggest other airports in the region whether its Kuala Lumpur Singapore or Hong Kong with all offering a much more hassle free travel.",5,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,J Service,United Kingdom,Horrible airport avoid it if you can. Cost cutting has increased the ambient temperature well into the uncomfortable range however you can find refuge in the cooler biz lounge. The customs officials are the most rude and unprofessional airport staff I've ever encountered. Arrived back late at night and airport was a building site.,,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,M Campbell,Australia,Very large airport lots of walking thought staff were quite unfriendly we had to get a connecting flight to Phuket transfer lounge was horrible uncomfortable seating and nowhere to grab a coffee. Very cold and unfriendly airport - couldn't wait to leave.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,L Robin,Thailand,Too big too hot - have to walk for such a long distance of course crossing the 1km duty free area which is a bit too much. Not the best airport I have been if you compare with Singapore or Seoul.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,A Cai,Australia,So much walking needed (at least for transit passengers). Toilets all behind shops - pretty unclean compared to other airports. The seemingly modern facilities - lacking quality. Lots of places have only dark lighting. Lots of signs have incomplete information. Map slightly confusing. Not a lot of restaurants and interesting shops. Stingy food servings. At least service personnel were nice enough spoke good English. Waiting gates and the check-in procedures tedious uncomfortable. Free WiFi available required tedious registration. Only available showers are in Lounges - my one (CIP) provided only basic one for 350 Baht. The 2nd time I went to the better one next door which cost 1200 Baht complete with WiFi computers food drinks couches. Hope this place will be improved.,5,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Farouk Mogheth,Thailand,"Flew from Bangkok to Prague to Paris and back with AF. Being in Thailand for 10 years I have to say that the Airport seems to be finally listening and certain changes are visible to make life easier in this large airport. The excruciatingly long walks from gates to passport control still remains and something no one can do anything about. Certain airlines simply park way too far at the end of the concourse. Passport control officers are much faster even if they still lack common courtesy. They are more ""efficient"" nonetheless. The security (X-ray) staff are the ones needing an extensive training in politeness and customer care as they do treat passengers as cattle. I 100% ignore duty free in Bangkok airport since it cannot be called such when prices are higher than in the city.. food too overpriced as well with internet offered but not functional. If having the option to transit then I would strongly suggest KUL HKG and SIN if you have the choice. For the rest of us who simply have to fly from and to Bangkok it is not as bad as it used to be granted that I ""ignore"" most of this port's services simply check in and rush to gate and fly. Land go through passport control and catch a cab rarely anything in between.",6,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,S Bailey,Hong Kong,It's embarrassing to see just how bad BKK has become. I use BKK at least 2-4 times a month and aim to spend as little time and money in the place as possible. Check-in for TG business class is the only good thing about the place (however the TG lounge is worn out and offers snacks I wouldn't feed the dog) Duty Free is not only more expensive than other major duty free shops in Asia it's more expensive than downtown Bangkok. The toilets are disgusting even the new ones. The F&B outlets are all very low quality yet charge high prices. The car park doesn't accept credit cards - it's cash only and you don't even get a receipt. And if you're unfortunate enough to use the public taxi's beware the same old scams are still in force (in August 2014).,,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Thomas Enriquez,United States,"Arrived and departed BKK in July and had an overall good experience at the airport. Have been here several times over the past 5 years and have noted significant improvement. The grey ""industrial"" appearance is not attractive and is a poor welcome to Thailand. However murals are nice more and better toilets and the shopping area is much better although with outrageous prices. Long long walks from gates to terminal with the ""people movers"" having an annoying voice at the end of each segment. Baggage and check-in/check-out were good and efficient. Passport control is still the worst - surly unfriendly robotic staff with no sense of humanity - welcome to the ""Land of Smiles""! Security was a minor frustration they confiscated a small bottle of Johnson's Baby lotion. All in all a reasonably good airport but not on par with other airports in Asia certainly not ""world class"" standard.",7,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Ken Gibson,United Kingdom,Arrived in Bangkok on 25th May and passed through as a transit passenger on 8th June. Very large airport - lots of long walks even with the people movers. Arrival experience very good with luggage arriving almost as soon as we were at the baggage belts. Transit on 8th June was more problematic. We were given a sticker to wear when checking in at Koh Smui and at Bangkok were to follow signs showing the same symbol as our sticker. Only problem was that some of the signage is far from clear several staff who we asked were unsure one even directing us to the right gate but to where arrivals were processed when we eventually found the right route 300 people were kept locked out of the gate and had to stand or sit on the floor in a corridor. When the gate opened there were only two staff (with 4 watching) checking boarding passes (which were checked again prior to boarding).,7,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Jen Hau Tou,Singapore,Can skip the free airport wifi which is unstable and most of the time poor wifi signals. Recommend to go to any of the restaurants or cafe in the airport if you need to access to Internet.,5,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,I've been travelling through Bangkok maybe a dozen times a year since the airport opened and there's definitely improvements. There's not much seating in Departures so it's best to arrive around the time your check-in opens (typically 3 hours with International Flights). I always check-in online for shorter queuing times. The upstairs security screening is reasonably efficient as is Immigration with somebody usually managing the queue system. Check-in early and kill time airside rather than checking in late and having to rush. I don't bother with Duty Free in BKK - it's expensive as are all the airside restaurants. There's not much seating in the main concourse but there are quiet areas 1 level down and obviously out towards the gates. Arrivals usually commences with a log walk from a remote gate but plenty travellators to help you on your way and highly variable queuing times for Immigration 20 minutes would be typical most times of they day but an hour not unusual at busy times. The baggage is pretty efficient in BKK and it's unusual to have to wait more than a few minutes for luggage. Plenty of taxi touts in Arrivals but just follow the signs downstairs for Public Taxi or Airport Rail Link. Also the lower levels are quieter if you have to spend a few hours between flights. There's also a food court with better Thai food than the airport restaurants. Now they have Security Screening out of the way upstairs in Departures the whole flow of the airport has improved. With enough Immigration Desks open fewer bottlenecks and some carriers moving to Don Mueang BKK is a better airport than it was a few years ago.,7,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,D Jackson,United Kingdom,Excellent clean and efficient. Immigration can be a bit slow at times due to the volume of people (make sure you complete your immigration card on the aeroplane). The walk from the plane to immigration can be over 1 km but travellators take care of 50% of this. Check in faster with Thai than Emirates. Head down to level one at the far end there is a small food court where for 100Baht you get a decent meal or head upstairs and pay premium. Once through emigration the drinks prices are inflated example 200 ml juice at 7/11 is usually 18 THB in Bangkok you pay 50 THB for same product here. Wifi free via a code ( collect on LHS after emigration ) but poor connection. Finally decent viewing facility up stairs on level 7 if you like watching planes. A good airport!,9,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,L Robin,Thailand,Very nice design but that's it very long walk to immigration long queue and only a few immigration counters open for a few hundred passengers spent over 1 hour in the queue. Immigration staff very unfriendly you don't feel welcome in Thailand. Airport staff don't speak English illegal taxi drivers always harass you to offer a ride. Duty free is fine but belong to the same company so prices are higher for many things than in town. think twice before purchasing. Smoking rooms are tiny.,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,K Piddick,Australia,"I can't understand the number of rather negative reviews of Suvarnabhumi. Remembering the purpose of airports for my money I think the airport functions well as a means to transport masses of people. I travel through the airport on a regular basis and for the most part - find it clean  efficient and comfortable. Signage is clear and informative. Security and Immigration is efficient and staff friendly enough - some even taking the time to smile and have a little joke with you. There are a lot worse airports out there - in supposedly ""developed"" countries.",8,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,R Woodhead,Thailand,"Took the ""airlink"" downtown to Makesan terminal: a waste of time as I then switched to a taxi which just got stuck in traffic. If you use this service make sure you have minimal luggage and transfer at Phyathai station to the over ground Shytrain as long as your final destination is near a station! Otherwise just take a taxi all the way from the airport this airlink makes very little sense.",3,1

bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,J Becker,United States,Flew into Bangkok from Tokyo and was very impressed by the airport. Very modern and very nice inside. It's enormous. Nicely decorated. Had no troubles getting through customs getting bags was easy. No problems at all.,9,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,A Kouvelis,Greece,Unfriendly custom stuff very difficult to follow signs very old lounges with unsmiling girls inside smoking rooms are small and dirty we felt like prisoners or criminals.,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Van Hiep Hoang,Vietnam,Good points: Quite new and big good design with good choice of food. Not so good points: Long walking distance (800 m between centre points plus additional up to 500 m to the gate). No sign board for departure time at arrival gates so you do not know in which direction to go if you go to the right direction it will be approx. 600 m if wrong direction then you might go up to 1300 m). Not enough air bridges for all big aircraft's (A330) like the one from and to Hanoi hence you have to take shuttle bus.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,F Lakey,South Africa,Returned from a family vacation to Thailand 10 days ago and must say passport control was hassle free on arrival en-route to Phuket but can't say same for departure after spending a 3 day stop over in Bangkok. My son was pulled away from counter by a supervisor without explanation or even an attempt to say why while my husband was just as delayed by the same officer at the counter before being let through. All this even though travelling as a family of 4. Kept fiddling with his passport and ticket then their computers and eventually stamping son's passport still not responding to our request for an explanation. Duty free very expensive. Will most likely go back if only I could understand what happened.,8,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Nick Tan,Singapore,Good aspects: told where to collect your luggage without needing to ask. Bad aspects: immigration clearance slow food quite expensive.,6,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,K Jones,United Kingdom,I have read other reviews. My experience of Suvarnabhumi is that it is neither better or worse than other airports. I agree that sometimes delays going through immigration can be lengthy; so I travel into BKK business class and am fast tracked through the arrival procedures. The business lounges are relaxing and excellent. I have eaten in the airport - not great but it's filled a gap. I do not agree that toilets are filthy it's not my experience. I find staff very helpful but I speak Thai. I travel to Thailand many times and usually the immigration officer says welcome home. I would agree that the airport is very busy and there can be a lengthy walk to Immigration.,8,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Paul Roberts,Switzerland,All in all a typically large and busy airport where you should expect to allow plenty of time for formalities. Once inside it takes a while to orient yourself but the gates are easy to find. It took me some time to realise that the main shopping area was on the upper floor. Shopping on the lower floors is scarce. Prices are not cheap and the toilets are a little unclean during busy times. On arrival we had to take the bus from the aircraft to the terminal but on departure we used a skybridge which is much more convenient.,8,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,W Barnes,United Kingdom,Arriving was fairly good but on the way back the queuing to go through immigration was be on ridiculous waited about an hour to get through immigration. The place is very big and very expensive for duty free.,5,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,John Bauman,United Kingdom,Flown in twice in the past few weeks. Queues for Passport/Immigration have become ridiculous. Earlier this year the queues zig-zagged out of the arrivals hall and down the ramp. Thought this was a one off issue having used the airport many times previously and never experienced any real problems. Not so. It is now the norm. Took in excess of 1 hour 30 mins in queues on both occasions just to get to the Immigration/Passport desk. Once at the desk all formalities completed in a couple of minutes. The reason for the huge queues is that very few Immigration desks are manned. Officers are employed to look at the queues and then disappear only to emerge minutes later to do the same again. eparting was so much faster. A real breeze. It appears that BKK is heavily promoting the paid for fast track arrivals coupon for THB850. I'll avoid BKK and go elsewhere rather than endure such nonsense again.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Thomas Johnston,United Kingdom,I think reviews of this airport depend on arriving or departing. I've rarely had difficulties flying out of Bangkok although I do make sure I'm there well in advance of my flight times. This is a very busy airport and always seems crowded due in my opinion to the lack of seating which leads to people walking up and down the concourse while waiting for their gates to be confirmed the duty free is very expensive and most of the shops seem to offer the same range of goods. The choice of food is quite good although the eating area again tend to get very crowded as people linger long after they've finished their meals just to have somewhere to sit. As all my flights are with Qatar I know which gates are usually used I have a Qatar Privilege Club Silver card so I can check in at the business counter and usually get a fast track pass and invitation to one of the Thai business lounges. Perhaps I'm just lucky in the fact that Qatar seem to have very efficient ground staff it's a pity they can't organise the arrivals also.,8,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,C St Michael,United States,"This is a beautiful looking airport but it is very poorly designed. It takes forever to reach your gate (if you can find out which gate to go to - information is almost impossible to find about departures). When you reach the ""gate"" there is no organized boarding process  just a great swarming. And then instead of boarding your flight you board a bus to take you to the vicinity of your plane. Probably the most frustrating airport experience I have had.",2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,S Levesnon,United States,It is quite cumbersome not to be able to deplane/depart directly onto a jetway but have to walk down/up steps with luggage onto a bus and vice versa. Found shops did not sell unique merchandise from Thailand.,4,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Tony Williams,United Kingdom,Always fly C or F class. No problems. Exit airport always within 25 minutes to my taxi.,10,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Erich Koller,Switzerland,Arriving transiting and departing BKK Suvarnabhumi is no problem in 9 out of 10 cases. The airport is generally well organised restrooms are kept clean at normal times and shopping is ok however pretty expensive. 1 out of 10 cases might be where something goes wrong especially at peak-times. Staff are always around with some restrictions. It's a global airport with global passengers. Food is available everywhere. Rather long distances (huge airport) have to be taken into consideration. Immigration and security control can be a hassle but in 9 out of 10 cases it is ok.,6,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Stephen P Taynton,China,For a relatively new airport BKK is a dismal failure. We could not check in for our flight so we had to wait five hours and there is little to do with poor restaurants and few shops. Once you get past immigration which is unable to cope there is not much else. I have travelled through BKK a number of times and I simply do not enjoy and will try and avoid but as a major international hub that may be difficult.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,S Amaya,Australia,Airport a bit messy toilets filthy and although shopping is quite good shops are quite far from gates - I almost end up missing my flight. Overall airport okay.,5,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Satya Sunkara,India,I had to travel through this airport 4 times and every time I had to ask for directions to my gate. Expect long walks and if you happen to sit closer to your gate there are no food or beverage kiosks. On top of it all the rest rooms were filthy all the 4 times I went through this airport. Also don't expect the restaurants and shops to accept all the major currencies. This time they declined to accept Australian dollars. Each shop has its own exchange rate.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,R Turnley,Dominican Republic,Nothing really improves at this appallingly designed airport . After being cooped up in a plane for 10 12 or even 14 hours it is too much to have to walk up to 2 kilometres to immigration which can not cope with the increased arrivals to BKK. They now boast the second largest number after London. For passengers like myself who are over 70 years old it is very difficult to walk so far on hard cement but this airport is the worst even surpassing the enormous distances one has to walk in MIA. The airport is a jumble inside and outside and I always pray that my gate is close to immigration but it never is. One terminal stretching for miles simply does not work for passengers.,1,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,C Kupper,Malaysia,Well a modern airport with so-to-say-top-notch facilities. In fact very disappointing. Long queues no logic in the building very difficult for orientation. When you have a connecting flight it is unclear where you need to walk (left or right) upon leaving your incoming aircraft. Not enough information screens and overloaded information counters. Extremely long walkways make you do good exercise but do not connect you in any way comfortably. This is the world's most disappointing airport vs. the expectations you may bring to see.,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,J Foye,Australia,I will not use this airport again staff were unfriendly and not in the least helpful they just grunted and pointed in which ever direction they wanted to send you which was usually wrong.

Shops were decent but few eateries of low quality. Boarding for each flight was a big production particularly for commuter flights.",4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,B Barliansyah,Indonesia,Have used this airport many times.

bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Yotsanan Areemitr,United Kingdom,Recently travelled back to Thailand and on arrival there were already ridiculous queues at passport control! Took over an hour just to get through and by the time I got to the baggage claim belt they were already putting bags through from another flight from Dubai which landed an hour after mine! BKK need to be more efficient when it comes to handling passengers! However despite being an enormous airport I'd say it's fairly easy to navigate around (well signposted etc) and fairly clean. Journey out of BKK was a bit of a nightmare the woman at the check-in desk was quite rude. I was looking around for the resealable bags for the liquids in my hand luggage and none were to be found despite various empty desk slots for them and signs reminding you about the security procedure. Tried asking airport staff and they were completely useless. Decided to go through with it and by the X-Ray machine there was a stack of them! Luckily security and passport control went a little smoother and staff seemed friendlier. Plenty of shops in departure lounge which was nice but departure gate was such a long way from security! Then at departure gate- plane was delayed and passengers weren't informed until about half an hour after scheduled flight time! Overall not such a great experience this time. Hopefully next time it'll be better.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Senthil Rengasamy,Australia,We recently travelled via Bangkok by Thai Airways on the transit to Delhi. This is our second time in 4 years though we prefer usually travelling Singapore Airlines. This is a pathetic airport staff cant speak or understand English rude duty free staff again cant speak anything other than local language. I am not even visiting the country but transit I expect the airport to be of a better standard. Long queues in security check in they make you go through it all over again even for transit travellers just getting from one gate to another in level 3. Overall the standards were pretty average. Would never recommend even bothering to visit this country or airport.,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Prabath Dematanpitiya,Sri Lanka,I was on my way to Dhaka and landed in BKK 3 hours early. On my boarding pass issued there was no gate number printed and I found it as C 4A from the information boards. Finally I found at the eleventh hour that the gate had been changed and now it was gate F which is almost more than 2 km from the gate I was staying. Rushed to the new gate and ran like nothing to catch the flight and they said that the gate was closed. Like to bring up following: Though I was telling all those security people that I was on the way to the new gate they never let the airline know that. Searching for a lost passenger was not at all effective by airport staff and even at supervisory level nobody speaks English.,7,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Van Hiep Hoang,Vietnam,This airport is mediocre since it is newly built for 45 Mil. passenger per year it still has no room for a A330 from Hanoi. We still have to travel by bus during rain or sun mostly in the heat with small children or babies. The lounges are good. Safety check is long and time consuming. Immigration can be long but good if you have small children. Immigration for domestic connection is very good and friendly.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Farouk Mogheth,Thailand,"Living in Thailand for 9+ years. Flew to and from Moscow SVO with Aeroflot. Check in is usually painless. It is the airline's responsibility to offer baggage drop off. The transportation to the airport is OK. taxis are cheap and in case you have only 1 luggage the train is OK even though the ""City Terminal"" at Makkasan is still non functional after being opened for more than 3-4 years. No check-in in the city just a large vast empty terminal to catch the train. Departure passport control and check is usually good and fast. Arrivals is always a pain an its really hit and miss. My last Arrival took me only 20 minutes but the Moscow flight 55 minutes. Officers are still too gloomy and treat arrivals like cattle. The biggest minus in this airport is the huge walking distances to passport control. Please fix the free wifi. Not sure I can recommend this large concrete colourless airport for layovers. I would definitely avoid it in favour of HKG SIN and ICN and even KUL.",6,1

bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,R Woodhead,Thailand,Arrived at 12 noon on 25th May 2013: huge queues at immigration with what must have been thousands of passengers. Not all the immigration desks were open and this meant queues going back to the arrival gates. I thought they had put more staff on duty but that must have been a short lived thing. How can a government promote tourism but ignore fundamental services to those tourists! The airport needs to get it's act together.,,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Erich Koller,Switzerland,Entering BKK has become better depending on the time of arrival. I arrived afternoon and had almost no queues.

Bangkok airport staff waited for us (I had asked colleague earlier to inform RBA about our delay and request assistance). Upon arrival airport/airline staff waited and rushed us to the RBA gate. We got onto RBA with just few minutes delay. Staff informed us that our bags would be sent to Brunei Airport the next day. We got our bags two days later.,10,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,J Polley,United States,I have flown into and out of BKK about 12 times in the last three years. Never had an unpleasant experience. The worst thing I can say about BKK is that it is very large. Some US airlines get the gates at the ends of the concourses making for long walks to the gate or immigration. Also depending on the type of aircraft occasionally deplaning using airstairs is required. Everything else about this airport is outstanding. At BKK I usually arrive between evening to late night and leave early morning or late night. The waiting time at security immigration and baggage claim has always been excellent. Check in wait has been good too with SkyPriority. Another feature of BKK is the positioning of the business-class lounges near the departure gates. With only a one or two minute walk to the gate you can stay in the lounge and work or relax right up to or even after boarding time.,10,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,A Brown,Thailand,Arrived at Suvarnabhumi on Friday 19 April from Amsterdam at 06.40 am deplaned walked 350 metres to immigration control picked up my baggage and exited the airport at 07.10. Very Good experience this time just hope they can keep it up.,9,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Michael Brein,Australia,We recently travelled through Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport to and from Melbourne. I was very impressed with the standard of the airport. Moving through customs and baggage collection was very easy and efficient. The staff at the airport were helpful and information available made movement round the airport and connecting flights simple and easy.,9,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Kevin Barrance,United Kingdom,Different experience depending on the time of arrival and departure. Upon arrival on Friday afternoon the queues for immigration were very long and many of the desks closed. Took around half an hour to get through which after a long 11 hour flight is poor. Going out on Saturday early morning it took over an hour and a half to check in go through security and then immigration. Once through we had to run to the gate to ensure we made our flight. The shops were empty - presumably because everybody was late for their flights! Coming back in was terrible - 45 minutes to clear immigration again hardly any desks open. Finally Saturday mid- morning leaving was bearable. Security less busy and actually friendly immigration with most desks open - such a contrast. I would hate to be an elderly person going through this airport. It must be so stressful.,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,A Syed,Australia,It's an ok airport nothing fancy (except for the terminal buildings). Security slightly tight but that's ok since it was understandable. One thing I liked was that the airport made a prayer room for us Muslims to pray in. I would like to visit this airport again.,7,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,John Grint,United Kingdom,I was pre-warned about the length of time taken at immigration but at midday Sat 23rd Feb. it was an absolute breeze from entering the airport to arriving at the departure lounge less than 25 minutes. I wish every airport was as efficient.,9,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Vijayakumar Arumugam,Australia,I transited through the Suvarnabhumi airport on my Sydney - MAA leg and during the return leg. Though the airport is modern and has the requisite facilities it gives an impression of being an unfinished article. For some strange reason when my flight from Sydney landed in BKK they used the bus to transport the passengers to the terminal. Though the staff are friendly they barely speak English which is surprising given the tourist arrivals in Thailand. I had to ask 5 different people before I could locate a place to charge my phone and laptop.,5,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Terence J O'Neill,United Kingdom,Modern airport easy to get to and from. The airport is easy to use and get about. Its cool and airy the toilets were always cleaned. The arrivals taxi rank is well administered with Taxi drivers under a constant watchful eye. Food is high quality and cheap. And a good duty free on the exit route home. Emigration/passport control (arrivals and departures) had two queue. Staff were quick to use all lines when it got busy. I was slightly worried to see poor line discipline at the metal detectors where the one lady with a hand held paddle seemed to be overwhelmed. But a good experience.,9,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Aditya Shrivastava,Australia,I had the pleasure of using the business class facilities here just a few days ago. I have noticed that Suvarnabhumi now makes arriving passengers disembark to the runway and get on a bus which then takes them to directly underneath immigration. I am not sure why this is but it happened twice on this trip (arriving from Melbourne and arriving back from Mumbai). I understand the distances in Suvarnabhumi are quite large between gates and immigration but this strikes me as overkill. Anyway without the long distances at arrival the journey through was comfortable on both arrivals. From plane to luggage belt in 30 minutes. I don't expect courtesies from immigration so never surprised if they are rude. And then quickly over to Novotel pickups and to the airport. I arrived at about 5am both times which appears quieter and the airport handles the queues quite well. Business class departures are very pleasant with a separate check-in section separate baggage screen and separate immigration then the lounge right ahead. The lounge was very good compared to Melbourne's Air New Zealand lounge and good range of foods and drinks. Of course still have to walk to the gate and with Suvarnabhumi that was the opposite end of the massive airport (business class lounge is near A/B/C wing I was departing both times at E wing. No travelators to help here. Just long walks. Couldn't find a trolley either so the walk was long. Finally to the other smaller business class lounge and then onto the plane. All up a very nice feeling and travel. I know economy is not so convenient but somethings are the same (such as the very long walks).,8,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Van Hiep Hoang,Vietnam,This airport is not bad but there are still many design mistakes. Not enough space for security checks hence they have to take the floor space near the elevator to do it. We came with a big aircraft (A330) from Hanoi we had to take a bus to the airport where you have to run with all other guests to your gates which is sometime not clearly indicated. Design is new but A/C system seems not to cope with the heat.,8,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,A D Thesira,Singapore,Have been a frequent visitor to the airport. Although there have some improvements I feel that they have been cosmetic. The feel of the building is still unfinished and looking tired. Immigration still remains a nightmare with long lines. Baggage waiting times are very inconsistent its more of a waiting game especially during peak hours. The departure area s are over crowded and messy with insufficient seating. Security control remains a joke with rude and unfriendly staff.,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,C Kraft,,I have travelled to BB at least 30 times over the last 3 years. The airport itself is nice but Immigration lines are a nightmare. In best case assume 1 hours in worst case 3-4 hours especially at arrival. December 2012 they now have an automatic passport for Thai nationals. So Thai nationals can get through in 1 minute. But tourists may have to wait 2-3 hours. Latest was yesterday at 3 o clock in the morning. I waited more than 2 hours. Automatic passport control for Thai nationals. And they assigned the same amount of passport gates for Tourists. Not even considering that the percentage of Tourists is probably 90% whereas the number of Thai's travelling was around 10%. So the airport invested a lot of money for bringing down the time for Thai's from 4 minutes to 1 minute instead of focusing on the real problem which is just getting worse and worse!,,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,B Moor,Thailand,"Beautiful but terribly designed airport. Departures is a mess. Arrival by taxi is confusing and have to cross a road to the gates where no cars give way. Check in isn't clear and is often a mess of queues with no staff control. Once you check in there is no clear direction to go. You end up going right up a little ""side way"". Arrivals is even worse. First you get confused where you've got to go. I saw many people coming back on themselves. Immigration is confusing with the signage. Immigration is quite fast (one positive). Getting your bags is badly organised and not clear where to go. Coming out of the gate which way do you go? If you go left the people waiting for you won't see you going right is the correct way to go and then you just hit a wall of people waiting. Food upstairs - not great over priced and I imagine in the position it is that the profits are not maximized by the number of people in the airport. Taxis - official taxi rank isn't clear or easy to find when first arriving. Unofficial taxi rank outside at arrivals is full of taxi drivers trying to scam you. Why is this not controlled? Terrible airport. Really badly designed. Nothing makes sense.",2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,A Snelling,United States,Arrival - Fine experience even after 30+ hours en route from the US. It only took five minutes to clear immigration. The bags took awhile to arrive but this just meant that I had time to exchange money at one of the many (competitive) vendors in the arrivals area. Departure - Horrible airport. It hard to believe that it is only six years old. The design seems like something from another era. Up through security I have no major complaints but then the entire experience really goes downhill. The first priority does not seem to be getting you to your gate but rather making sure you are exposed to every single one of the very high end shops. I did not see one newsstand or bookstore anywhere although I did finally see a great drugstore. There are some normal food options toward the end. The gate situation could not have been designed by anyone who travels much. You sit outside the gate area in a place with few seats until shortly before boarding. It is a crowded miserable experience. Your boarding cards are submitted as you enter the (secure) gate area where more seating is available. It is odd to have precious little seating where most people wait. I read that they are trying to make this airport one of the top ten in the world but there is just no way.,4,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,C Allnatt,Belize,Fabulous airport. Soaring high roofs check in was a breeze. We flew EVA Air. I had the best meal I'd eaten at an airport and the prices were low for a major international airport. Great shopping too with reasonable prices. If I have one minor complaint it's that the actual departure gate area is bland and boring compared to the rest of the airport you should only go to the departure gate when it's close to boarding time.,10,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Anurag Srivastava,India,The airport is huge sometimes that is nice and sometimes a nightmare if you are short on time. We has a nice experience when changing flights from HYD-BKK to BKK-HKG but the return was not so comfortable. Had 85 minutes between flights but the HKG-BKK was 25 minutes late and the long walk ways we literally had to run with half-asleep kids. But the airport is clean signage is clear and did not have a very crowded feel. Plenty of seating and decent amenities.,6,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Rob Kuhner,United Kingdom,Large airport - there are some gates to this airport that mean you have a long walk to get to them. This means going past lots of shops - like being in a mall. Not fair on the passengers. If you like shopping - a big choice also nice places to eat. There are places to sit and rest. Allow enough time to get to gates. Toilets are plentiful. Has a tall high roof and feels huge and airy.,9,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,I've been fairly critical of BKK in recent years but there is a marked improvement in the Immigration and Security arrangements over the past few months and queuing times are better since the Budget Carriers have moved to Don Muang. The new Security Area upstairs is quick and efficient (5 mins). There are now better arrangements in both Arrivals and Departures Immigration (10 mins and 5 mins) in early evening which a few months was anywhere up to an hour or more. There also seem to be more Immigration Officers on duty now. The Check-in areas and Baggage Halls have never been a problem. The Airport is desperately short of seating areas away from the Gates. Overall BKK is better than a year ago.,5,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Michael Jenkins,Hong Kong,This must be the worst designed most poorly organised 'modern' airport in the world. Only 6 years old but apparently from a design 40 years old and it shows. 40 years ago air travel was different fewer people fewer flights more time to shop if you wanted to. That is not the case today. It is designed as a shopping mall with plane parking on the end it does not have enough space for immigration or security checks. Huge distances to walk to and from the planes.,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,James Halley,Thailand,Arrived late at night mentally preparing for the customary long lines at immigration. At that time it was usually very busy with flights coming in from the USA and Korea. When I got to the immigration hall I joined a line with just one person in front if me. Has the message finally got through? I will know in December!,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,B Walberer,United States,BKK airport is a work in progress. It has improved over the years but it is still essentially an overpriced shopping mall. What annoys me the most are not lines for immigration and security - waiting times have improved and the times where one had to wait in line for over an hour for immigration seem to be over. However it's the small things that annoy me such as uneven air conditioning throughout the airport help staff that does not properly speak English long walks to and between gates and unannounced changes such as the closure of parts of the arrival floor to non-passengers.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Thomas Warren,Thailand,My first use of BKK Suvarnabhumi was on its opening day. It remains a mid-tier airport. Assets include airy architecture in much of the facility (but this is no better than many of its contemporaries) rail access and a few land-side services such as banking and phone kiosks. Deficiencies include signage informative literature {maps etc.} for newly arrived passengers inadequate capacity leading to queues of aircraft and passengers on many occasions and tedious access to and from distant gates. The airport has not yet solved the excessive influence of King Power on facilities quality and pricing. For example it's better to eat at the airport Novotel than at most tenants in the airport. Suvarnabhumi remains an unfinished project - even though at age 6 years its capacity has already been exceeded and strained. Would I recommend this airport? Maybe no maybe yes. Personally I often find better availability of long-haul connectivity to/from other airports in the region thus often go there - sometimes making the short connecting hop to/from BKK by low cost carrier.,5,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Anthony Sullivan,Australia,I have been travelling in and out of this airport for many years now. Has greatly improved in regards of seating inside the international terminal. Customs and baggage retrieval very good both arriving and departing. Still somewhat lacking in terms of food inside the international section. Still though very much improved from initial opening. Hope they can keep up the improvements.,7,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Davison Horst,United States,This was my first time back through Suvarnabhumi in 3 years. The improvements are noticeable. It's still one of if not the largest airport in the world. The airport has an abundance of eating places and facilities all of which are pretty good. It is a long distance from the plane to immigration. However there are travelators for those that don't want to walk. Immigration is efficient and quick. Baggage claim is pretty straight forward. When departing it is a short distance to the check in desks and plenty of free luggage carts are available curbside. I found check in to be easy and efficient although there were 4 of us and 8 bags. Departure security was somewhat clumsy but there are pleasant attendants. Departure lounges are spacious and comfortable especially since they replaced the hard plastic seats with cushioned seats. All in all I would say that this airport has come a long way from when it first opened and it is now one of the better airports I've been through.,9,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Federico Muscogiuri,Spain,Architecturally it is a beautiful airport and I should also remark that the direct train to the city is fast and cheap. However it is badly planned and poorly designed. As many have already remarked not only are the queues long and the walks endless but the gate design is illogical and the signage poor. Staff seem to resent working in this environment and most of them are unfriendly and unsmiling.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Farouk Mogheth,Thailand,A quick trip for 2 weeks BKK-Prague-BKK. Check in was smooth as usual especially when you are web- checked-in otherwise expect a long line. Passport control is again different there is an escalator to an upper floor where you go through security check first once you go through you loop around and go down again to the ground floor to the new passport control (much smaller area than before which could cause trouble in rush hours). This would ensure that non passengers could see or reach the passport control area. The re-entry office is there again after several years and its a welcome. Passport control was OK but still not that quick they have their average days and much worse days. Duty free and food is a joke and never use them. Simply overpriced and nothing special. Gates are barren grounds with nothing but grey around. Boarding is a so so experience but ample seating for all which can be a problem in other airports. Transportation is good.,7,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,O Johansen,Norway,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport was meant to be one of the best in Asia. But as things have turned out it is one of the many middle class airports without a soul and without any chance to beat the 4 and 5 star airports in the region. The airport is not that old but it looks like it is very old! The main problem is the long walks for most transit passengers and the huge crowds waiting to stamp their passport in front of the tired- looking immigration officers. I would also mention the horrible prices of anything you buy at the airport. Often double the price of buying the same item in Bangkok. Compared to Singapore and Hong Kong; Bangkok har a long way to go to present a 5 star airport.,3,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,S Morley,China,For a newer airport it's amazing how poorly designed it is. I was shocked at the lack of thought put in to the layout. The automated check-in machines don't work. No power ports anywhere it looks like they originally had them but they have all been removed. No free wifi which even regional airports have nowadays. The line managers at passport control were busy chatting with each other and provided no direction at all. This resulted in lines moving at half speed. I literally cant think of a single good thing to say about this place other than I'm leaving it.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,John Duffus,Thailand,After all the reported delays at Immigration starting early June BKK is now experiencing 4 months of aircraft delays. The Thai Airports Authority is closing each runway for 8 weeks for strengthening and resurfacing. Wide-body jets can only use one runway whilst single aisle aircraft can take off from both but only land on one. My Emirates flight from HKG was delayed 15 minutes on take-off whilst waiting for a landing slot and then stacked twice prior to landing ending up with another 30 minute delay. One United flight ex-NRT had to be diverted to Don Mueang when it became low on fuel. If Gatwick's single runway can be in the middle of an 8-month similar exercise and yet remain open for flights virtually throughout what is really wrong with BKK's runways that requires them to be closed to most aircraft for such a lengthy period?,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Mark Wilkins,United Kingdom,Flew in late May flew out early June. As per other recent comments both the immigration has improved since my last visit with only a handful of people queued at any booth - inbound this was at a peak period as well. My luggage appeared promptly on the inbound as well within 10 mins of clearing customs. I did notice the exchange rate was much poorer in the airport for some reason which is something to be aware of. The main improvement that now needs to be looked at is the lack of good quality public area seating post immigration here.,8,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,It seems like the airport are finally responding to the negative comments around some of the outrageous waiting times at Immigration over the past year. There seems consistently more Immigration Officers on duty now and the snake system for queuing is supervised properly. It's still not as good as the airport it replaced 5 years ago but it's acceptable.,5,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,P Nunn,United Kingdom,In a year this has leapt forward no standing in line for passport control on arrival bags delivered quickly and out of the airport within 35 mins of leaving the plane. Still the usual amount of people approach you airside asking if you want a taxi when its a AOT limo service. Overall a good arrival experience. On departure no lines at check-in as all Thai Airways desks looked open passport control I had 2 people in line before me and would have been quick but one of them had lost their departure card. Security lines were longer but nothing huge. My one big gripe with this airport is the shopping there is a great range of shops - but - they are very expensive and one shop can blend into another and you do not know you have crossed into another shop. Good food selection. Walk to some gates can be longer than you think.,9,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,B Walberer,United States,BKK airport is basically an overpriced shopping mall with attached gates. The airport is functional and if you are lucky like me immigration can be quite fast (less then 5 min on the last few occasions). However without access to a lounge you can't expect many amenities only bare bones seating areas. Other modern airports in the region such as SIN KUL HG and ICN are way ahead of BKK in terms of customer amenities. Also the distances within the airport such as from your gate to immigration or transfer can be quite long up to 1 km! Overall a 3 star airport best avoided for long transfers but ok for arrivals and departures.,5,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,E Koller,Switzerland,Airport has certainly improved in many areas: Immigration now faster and better organised even staff friendlier. Security centralised and faster better organised. Toilets clean and restaurants fairly priced and ok. Only the huge amount of so called duty-free shops are overpriced.,7,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,P Davies,Thailand,It is not just the queuing which has improved but the attitude of immigration staff. The Duty free is grossly overpriced restaurants are ok. Toilet facilities are fine.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Trevor Young,Australia,There are serious problems with huge delays at Immigration both directions. I shuffled and staggered in an arrivals 'mob' for 2 hours. One poor lady just in front of me reached the Immigration counter and was sent away (to the end) because she had not held onto to her Boarding Pass from the flight she just arrived on. By the way I didn't have mine either but was in the next line and not asked. Thailand is called the Land of Smiles but not at the airport!,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Simon Chinn,Cambodia,The worst feature by far is the ridiculous transfer counter system which the airlines and counters split at either ends of the airport meaning 850m walks between them. The airport is dreary grey with unfinished decor pipes and electric's showing on the ceilings in arrivals. It's 'H' shape means walking 900m+ from one end to the other if transferring. If you're upstairs in the eating / departure area it's very hot as the sun comes in through the glass roof. Recently the passport control waiting has been exceptionally long maybe due to work being carried out. The best feature is the fast sky train into the centre of the city at Phaya Thai station (but beware the one that terminates at Makassan station as you have to walk a long way).,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Chia Yossarian,Thailand,"Immigration lines have been out of control for almost a year now. Expect to queue for 2 hours unless you are lucky. Add to this long corridors to reach the gate and few seating areas (everywhere it is crammed with overpriced ""Duty Free"" shops - charging about 30% more than Bangkok High street - and you have a contender for ""worst airport in SEA"".",1,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Farouk Mogheth,Thailand,Flew for a quick getaway to Seoul Korea and then back to BKK. Passport control issue depends on when your flight is. Certain bottle neck rush hours (3-4pm and 8-9pm) are the worst and passengers line up out of the immigration area to the check-in counters. The snake system was finally introduced at arrivals and passed very quickly in 20min. Individual passport processing time is still long though. Duty free isn't really duty free at all food is too expensive and free airport wifi never works. Staff try to smile as much as they can but unable to help other than giving directions anything more complicated and you're on your own.,5,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Mickael Chia,Malaysia,Was in transit Good parts - picked up from tarmac to First Class lounge with private van then buggy inside the terminal. Lounge spacious adequate food wifi bathing facilities. 1 hour full body massage was luxurious and effective. Bad parts - although flight connected to aerobridge we then had to walk down to the tarmac! Inexcusable for a new airport. Walk to departure gate had several escalator up/down and one stairs down although a ramp is provided.,8,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,John Duffus,Thailand,Arrived last night around 00.20 on a full A380. After all the stinging criticism of the Departures Immigration problems when I departed 2 weeks ago I discovered these have been partly solved with more staff and the introduction of a snake queue system. So having seen that this works why is it that the management of this airport still insist on no snake system at Arrivals? Worst of all last night was the almost complete absence of public taxis at 01.00 am. The queue for these snaked right back into the building. Trying then to get back up to Arrivals level to take one of the notoriously expensive Airport Limousine Taxis I discovered that despite an abundance of escalators and moving walkways you can not get back up! Either they are deliberately switched off or there is a guard on duty who will not permit you to access them! There are also lifts but even these will not permit access to the Arrivals level! What on earth is the purpose of expensive limousine taxis if passengers can not get access to them! I go in and out of this airport a couple of dozen times a year and the continual difficulties passengers are subjected are sadly farcical!,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,F Hekster,Hong Kong,Disappointing and slow check-in process. Long queues and only 3-4 counters open with too many people doing nothing. Immigration and security very smooth on the other hand. Air conditioning didn't seem to work everywhere in the departure hall some areas were very warm. Toilets are not very clean and fairly old. Good shopping no problems in that department.,7,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Aditya Shrivastava,Australia,Visited twice in the last week. First time arrived at 8pm on a Fri night the queue was relatively short and took 15 minutes. Queues departing were short and painless. Came back on an early morning flight and whilst the queue was long it took 20-30 minutes to pass through - very organized and well staffed at immigration. Departing the next day at 5.30am the queue for check-in was horrendous - it took 45 minutes to check-in. I recommend online check-in when arriving for early morning flights. The queue for immigration was well maintained and orderly. However baggage screening area is far too small for the crush of people.,7,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,B Sant,Thailand,This airport is a disgrace. Although passengers have been complaining of its poor services for years - nothing has been done. Overpriced food passport control takes far too long and causes passengers to miss flights.,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Anne Collier,Australia,I recently spent 1.5 hours in the immigration queue going into Bangkok and my daughter who arrived from a different part of the world spent 2.5 hours. It was most unpleasant with people jostling and trying to jump the lines - there was no order to the procedure.,5,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,A McNicol,Australia,Departed at 09.15 on 22 March. Absolutely no queue at passport control - a very easy experience! Arrived at 23.00 on 16 March and took 30 minutes through immigration and 45 minutes in the taxi queue which was totally chaotic.,7,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,J Cullen,United Kingdom,Allow plenty of time to go through passport control. It took us a very uncomfortable (and squashed) hour to get through a queue of only 20 metres - no seating or facilities once you pass the barrier. Queue jumping was most annoying. Probably the worst ever departing experience. Felt very sorry for those with children! Be prepared - take plenty of water and patience and go to the bathroom before you join the queues!,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Dominic Olsson,,Yet another complaint about immigration queues. It took me 1 hour 22 minutes seemingly shorter than some other reviewers and the reason was that there were 4 booths open for the 200-300 people in front of me. I'd rank such disorganised airports as Sydney Ho Chi Minh and Denpasar as better run than Bangkok.,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Andrew Richards,United Kingdom,All I can say is the immigration procedure is farcical. You can expect at least a 1 hour wait at best to clear immigration the adverts say Thailand the land of smiles - noticeably lacking by officers who eventually seemingly begrudgingly stamp your passport allowing you to enter Thailand. Very unwelcoming start to your visit.,1,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Paul Williams,United Kingdom,Immigration at this airport is a disgrace. It negates all other efforts of Thailand to welcome visitors. Queues are not managed leading to selfish passengers barging in unfairly frayed tempers even risk of injury. Times at passport control can be up to three hours. This airport's immigration arrangements are a joke.,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Horst Jakob,Germany,The main complaint is the incredible time you have to spend at immigration. Calculate at least one hour to wait. It might be difficult to find the end of the queue. It tends to spread quite far into the check-in area! Another problem are the long distances to reach the gates especially when in transit. Expect at least a walk of more then one km. Shops are nothing special. Rest areas are non existent except if you have access to any of the lounges.,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,L Guan,China,"Completely agree that the immigration queue for departures is the most horrible I've ever experienced. The problem simply worsened exponentially now as the airport is undergoing ""renovations"" - in short the original VIP channel was shut down and they had to ration out the non VIP channels as the temporary VIP channels making the already chaotic scene even worse. Yesterday I queued for 1.5 hours to get through immigration. It was impossible to find where the queue started and which queue led to which counter there was hardly any staff to maintain the order. Security staff are poor mannered and sometimes can be very offensive. Once passing through security things started to get better: the food selection was good and plenty of cafes and shops. The lack of free internet is disappointing. I think the airport needs to improve on the ""soft items"" like staff manners and enhancement of orders rather than hardware (except for the free wifi).",2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,E Markley,United States,This airport needs to change its immigration operation drastically. Queuing is similar to a supermarket with lines stretching out from each desk and moving at the pace of the officer. Slow processing officers' lines move slowly fast processing officers lines move less slowly. We arrived in the afternoon and lost 2 hours making our way through lines. Lines for international departures are just as bad. If traveling on business premium immigration/security line access is essential if you do not want to arrive 4 hours in advance of your flight. While the airport is architecturally attractive on the outside the interior is spartan and much time is spent in concrete encased hallways. Food is accessible but overpriced. Overall Bangkok has great potential in its facility but is let down by its operations.,1,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Oddvar Johansen,Norway,Avoid if you can! After only these relatively few years Bangkok airport looks very old! Don't buy anything. Everything including food and duty free articles are overpriced. Not to mention queuing for passport formalities.,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Mike Anthon,Thailand,"I live in Thailand and been in and out the airport for 7 years now. The airport link train is ok but not convenient. The check-in process is usually painless if you check-in online however the achilles heal is passport control. Slow disinterested with rather rude hand gestures and barking of requests and manners change depending on your ""ethnic origin"". The system is very slow and inefficient. Security check always fast and efficient. Very long walks free Internet not working forcing you to use the charged service food overpriced. Boarding is ok. Arrivals - long walks and then the dreaded passport control. If you need to use BKK as transit I seriously suggest far more civilized options as SIN KUL HKG.",1,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Paul Francis,Thailand,I pass through this airport every month and every month I dread it. Huge queues for immigration (last time it took 1 hr 45 mins and I almost missed my flight). The toilets are dirty and often broken. The stores and food outlets are overpriced. I travel all round the world and this airport ranks as one of the worst major airports I travel through.,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,J Smith,United States,"Been through 3 dozen times in 20+ years due back at the end of the year. Shuddering thinking about the incompetence and long lines for Immigration/Security and the off handed way of Staff. Airport has vastly improved in infrastructure and cleanliness but the overpriced Food/Goods and ""couldn't care less attitude"" of staff make it a horrendous experience arriving and departing.",5,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,S Pax,Australia,Flight out of Bangkok on 02 March scheduled at 00.15 hours. What a mess that airport is. I dread flying through there. Check-in was OK but immigration took over an hour and almost missed our flight we got to the gate at 00.25. There is no organisation at immigration every time.,1,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,W John,Thailand,"Mile-long walks to the gate overpriced stores inefficient immigration. I've been through 30+ times and never look forward to it. The airport is new and clean and it's a pity it's not organized better. Immigration is extremely slow and disorganized it takes 40-90min to go through both on arrival and departure. They don't keep the arrival forms stocked and nobody knows where to obtain them. Airport staff are nice but mostly clueless. All smiles willing to help but usually not speaking enough English to help. Food options airside are overpriced. Landside it's a bit better. Security staff are reasonably polite. Getting out is a hassle too unless you know your way. Metered taxis to the city can be found on 1st level but there are pushers trying to sell you a ""limousine taxi"" for 1000+ baht instead of the typical 250-400 meter fare. Airport link train is efficient and useful if you know where to go.",2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,B Marcus,United States,Transiting through this airport is nightmare. I had to walk around two miles from my arriving flight to the transit security area. The transit security screening area makes US Airport Security look efficient and organized. Staff were downright rude. I was flying Thai Airways Business Class and I had to convince 5 supervisors that I was entitled to go through the Priority Line. The regular line was at least 45 minutes. Thai Airways Lounge was a little overcrowded. I have been through this airport a couple of times this year and it seems like everyone is so disorganized. The only thing this airport has going is its modern structure. I much prefer Singapore and Kuala Lumpur Airport.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Peter Bauer,Germany,Arrival: very long waiting and unfriendly staff at immigration. 3 of 4 lifts are blocked not to stop at arrival level! Many exit-doors are locked only the one leading to the airport taxis are open. Arrival area much to small and too many shops. Bathrooms are dirty and broken. Departure: If you arrive on the ground-level you are not aloud to use the many escalators that lead to the upper floors. We had to wait 10 minutes to squeeze in to a tiny elevator. Many officials in that airport have no manners and don't know how to deal with customers.,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,After a brief period of functionality the Departure Immigration problems are back - and worse than ever. In Departure Immigration at 10pm queues were stretching the entire length of the terminal just to get into the 2 Immigration areas - 45 mins to get into the Immigration Area and a further 50 mins to get your passport stamped - so nearly 2 hours after checking in just to get to the Departures Concourse and make a dash to the gate. No organisation on behalf of the airport other than some barriers and queue jump was totally out of control. The Departure arrangements in BKK are totally broken.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,M Eggleton,United Kingdom,I have travelled to and through BKK a few times now over the past few years and it's a good airport helpful staff and lots of shops - but that's about it. I found food prices over the top and the toilets dirty - not up to the standards you would expect from such a large and popular international airport. Everything is well signed and there are some nice reclining leather seats to sleep in if you have a long stop over although a lot of them are broken.,6,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Peter Borschberg,Singapore,The only thing going for this airport in my opinion is that it is fairly new and clean. The transit from international to domestic flights are ok if you fly with THAI (separate processing passport control). But my praise pretty much stops here. The walking distances (especially if you are a transit passenger on connecting international flights) are too long. The international departures section is too sprawling and cluttered. The domestic departure area is really nothing to shout about. And the prices charged at food outlets are just too high by Thai standards.,4,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,N Fujiwara,Japan,Immigration is true nightmare and has not improved in many years. Facilities and service is not worth the expensive 700baht airport tax. No convenience no kindness very expensive goods foods and drinks. This airport seems only to care about earning money and not the passengers.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Ernest Gutierrez,United States,I agree with A. Barnett. Arrived exhausted past midnight after long haul from IAD to find long lines at Passport Control. Male official very unwelcoming. I had lost my boarding pass and he gave me a very hard time because supposedly I could not prove what flight I had arrived on. Even after I produced my itinerary showing both the UAL and CO confirmation numbers he would not move me forward. He became quite angry when I told him I could not understand his English which was quite poor. Found a friendly and helpful attendant who came to explain the merger to him and he finally relented. I noticed he had also given two people ahead of me a difficult time and as a result there was a cluster of us just waiting around his counter to see what he would do next. They need more friendly immigration agents if they are to line the passport control process with their tourism promotion. Despite this used BKK again several times during month long stay in the area and other agents' politeness made up for this hopefully one-off nasty agent.,4,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Alan Nguyen,Australia,We arrived here from SGN. We went to get our passport cleared where we waited 2 hrs baggage claim was a breeze and we went to the lower floor and the taxi service was very efficient. We came back early in the morning for another flight to DPS and there was quite a bit of walking but everything was smooth. Would use again.,8,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Casper van der Walt,China,Bad signposting for transit passengers. Otherwise clean free Internet and good duty-free.,7,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Joselito Anonuevo,Saudi Arabia,Very nice and clean airport. My wife and I flew business class and we were given a premium pass to help us through security and immigration. Very good service and found the airport very user friendly.,10,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,N Werner,Switzerland,Arrived on domestic flight and was bussed to baggage reclaim. Took a while for bags to arrive. Airport train to city is convenient and quick however the timing is only every 30 minutes. Lucky for us we caught it with one minute to spare. Departure was a breeze as we were on TG business class and they have their own check-in area with security check and immigration which means no queuing and we were in the lounge immediately after. It is a functional airport and if you are in Business Class it is a breeze in Economy things look different though.,6,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Rishad Patell,India,Flew into Bangkok airport and arrived at 1pm to find massive immigration lines. Took the 4 of us 1.5 hrs to get through immigration. People without visa's did not know they had a separate line. Some lines seemed to be clusters of people pushing each other around. The immigration officers still managed to smile and be polite. On the way out check-in was a breeze. Lines getting out through immigration and customs once again slow disorganized and chaotic. Duty free is not cheap.,7,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,A Dutta,United States,While the structure shopping amenities and ornamentation are impressive the operational management and treatment I received was disgraceful. My connecting flight was slightly late the transit security line was a mob scene and I had to move to the side and shove my way to the front where it seemed airport security was selectively letting people without boarding passes through. When I finally arrived at the gate there was a shouting match going on between the gate attendant and a guy who was trying to board the flight without a boarding pass. When I arrived the attendant said I could not get on the flight because my bags were too big even though boarding was still going. I argued back and forth then finally tried to walk away from the mob scene at which point the attendant began shoving me and my bags. Finally I was able to move through the chaos and get on the flight after about 20 minutes of unnecessary wrangling. Airport operatives here do not seem to be above the board in how they deal with customers.,1,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,John Samson,New Zealand,Have found it a positive experience inbound and out - busy no matter what time you are there. Impressive environment facilities are good however the food area on the 4th level is a complete rip off. Avoid it unless you want to pay out of this world prices.,8,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,John Duffus,Thailand,Arrived on THAI business class around 2330 and made for Fast Track Immigration. Only one queue open with a longer line than in the normal Immigration desks! It took over 10 minutes for a 2nd officer to arrive and start reducing the queue. I use the airport a couple of dozen times a year and agree it has started slowly improving the product for passengers. Still very few food and beverage outlets at Departures level though and Duty Free remains amongst the highest in the region. A premium vodka is still one third more expensive than Hong Kong for example. More people movers at Departures Level are urgently required.,5,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Espen Gyllstroem,Norway,Travelled to and from this airport 6 times over the last 9 months and I have nothing to complain about. It is clean systematic and easy airport to get around. Even after my first few visits I easily find my gate. I think it is great that some smoking rooms are present. If you want to spend a limited amount of money or if you want to spend a lot of money there is always places to eat and things to buy.,9,1
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Simon Brown,United Kingdom,I fly to BKK twice a year. Suvarnabhumi is a soulless environment. Bare concrete and steel tresses are abundant. It is functional it does what it says on the tin. I preferred Don Muang for it's character not to mention the Royal Thai Golf Course between the two runways there. However never had any major dram's with baggage immigration or transfers between International and Domestic at Suvarnabhumi.,8,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Franz Jaeger,United States,I have flown in and out of this Airport hub many times. I was never treated unkindly or with disrespect by anyone despite the hectic environment. Customs have been less than a 20 minute wait every time. The retail section is pricy when compared to the average price on the street in the surrounding areas of Bangkok but when compared to other airports it is quite good charging no more than for example a London or New York location. Airport is contemporary and modern clean and functional.,8,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,A Barnett,Mexico,Immigration is a nightmare both inbound and outbound of the country. (Long Lines) Immigration agents are a little bit friendlier than in the past but they still do not say anything nor smile. Land of Smiles has not found BKK yet.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,T Thomson,United Kingdom,Arrived 6pm to the usual immigration chaos long lines and only half the booths open. Usual slowness from officials. 1hr 10min later picked up my bag. On exiting and passing all the touts looking for business I used the new airport-city train link which was a pleasant inexpensive experience. On return the check-in was smooth but then the same at emigration - long lines backing into the check-in area. An hour later I was through. Duty free is expensive and the food outlets charge crazy prices - 60baht for a bottle of water. Fortunately I had a lounge pass. All over the airport they advertise the slogan 'Airport of Smiles'. Nothing has improved at Bangkok despite all the press releases and all the promises.,1,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,The difference in crowding between afternoon and late evening is dramatic. The terminal is so much quieter in the afternoon - 5 mins to check-in Air Asia 5 mins in Immigration and 2 mins in Security - try that at 9pm. Other than that the seating areas at the beginning of the Piers are a welcome addition.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Robert Fraser,United Kingdom,For a relatively new airport this one is an architectural disgrace. Designed with no thought to passenger flow or convenience. It's basically a kilometre long thin tube lined with shops Immigration and Emigration cramped with most desks unoccupied leading to queues that back up on themselves. Airline lounges are impossible to find due to a complete lack of signage. Passengers are expected to walk several hundred metres because of the lack of travelators.,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,James Halley,United Kingdom,I try to limit my journeys through BKK as much as I can. On this latest occasion I decided to sit it out in the terminal. In wandering around I did notice a ray of hope for future outbound travellers - it looks as if they are expanding one of the outbound immigration areas. I observed the late night rush to Europe and Australia which was as bad as ever snaking back almost to the check-in desks. Inbound immigration was quicker than in the past but as others have commented no 'emotion' from the IOs.,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Bernie Redinger,Australia,We found arrivals/departures extremely seamless and stress free. Quick to get through immigration - security with no real delays. Lots of duty free and good food options. We had to spend 6 hrs waiting for next connection for flight home and didn't find the wait as bad as we thought it would be. Taxi area can be chaos but that's normal. Overall quite an impressive airport.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Masaki Oda,Japan,A huge terminal building. Clean modern well maintained facilities however the biggest problem is that they are not strategically located. If you are a Star Alliance Gold member travelling Economy class on a TG international flight the check-in counters are located at one end of the terminal which are far from TG international Economy counters with not enough signs to indicate. The departure immigration and security queues are within an acceptable length. In addition there are lots of shops in the concourse. Thai's lounge is also nice however you have to walk a few hundred meters to enter it and to get to flights you have to go downstairs and walk back another few hundred meters to the gate. As a result we need to leave the lounge more than 45 mins before departure to be safe. It is a good airport but you cannot enjoy the facilities if you only stay there for less than 2 hrs.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,P Nunn,United Kingdom,I used this airport a lot during my trip. International arrival. Walking distance from plane to passport control was ok the line for passport control was average but each desk has its own line. About 90% of desks were being used. In one case people had not filled out landing cards and were allowed to fill them in at the desk holding up that line. Baggage had started arriving by the time I had cleared passport control. Domestic (BKK-CNX one way) (BKK- USM-BKK) check in desks close to domestic security control no queues for my airline short line for security longer walk than expected to gates but good selection of shops and food outlets. International departure. Arrived early for my flight so was there for opening of check-in so it was very quick. However it took me over 1 hr to clear passport and security again 1 desk 1 line slowing process down. If they can sort this problem out then all would be well. Good selection of shops and food outlets but none at gate areas.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,L Ralte,India,Used this airport for transit only so dont have much to say on immigration and check in. For a transit passenger sailing through arrival to transit is quite easy signs are clear enough to take you to your next flight and if you've hours to kill this is not a bad place to be. Reclining seats are a good place to kill your jet lag as you wait for your next flight. Also the Thai massage experience is a must which is not expensive. Free wifi and food court almost everywhere allows you to taste thai food. The airport is clean and staff are helpful.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Quek Keng Guan,Singapore,Arrived from Singapore at 8am. It took me 10 mins to pass immigration and luggage was out at the belt within 15 mins after landing. The trolleys were free. Vat refund at the airport was prompt and efficient. One has to verify the purchases before check in and obtain the customs chop and signature before claiming the Vat refund in the duty free area. I have managed to check in the items before proceeding to the VAT refund in the duty free area. Queue was short and VAT refund was processed within 10 mins. There was a lot of passengers shopping in the duty free area. Was told that the boutiques in the duty free are open for 24 hrs unlike Spore Changi where they are open till midnight. Managed to get some good buys at the duty free as my flight was delayed for 4 hrs. Prices and selection of food quite reasonable. 2 FOC internet PC were available in each dep gates. However BKK airport can be improved by having more indoor plants as it appears to be rather depressing and cold in the arrival and departing gates. Overall a pleasant airport.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Farouk Mogheth,Thailand,"Flew with Qatar from Bangkok-Hanoi. Bangkok airport is a hit or miss depending on flight times. Passport control was not zigzagging from the area out to the check in counters. Officers did their job without a hint of emotion. Duty free was ignored all the way through. A rather good experience but if you need to fly from/to Europe then you are most probably stuck in the airport's rush hour and it seriously deteriorates the travel experience. Regarding the free internet wifi the signal is full but no connection. Thus assuming its the usual ""we have wifi as most international airports"" but the network is not functional trying to force you to get the paid gateways. a shame really.",4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,P Glen,Malaysia,"Considering it is a new (relatively) 'flagship' airport it is poor. Design is a mess huge areas of glass in the tropics - stupid mistake which means the window areas are now having blinds retro fitted. Convenient seating sometimes impossible. Wi-Fi is a complete & utter joke you have to go to an info desk these seem to be situated at the very extremes of the terminal so this in itself involves a long walk and sign a register with personal details (which are not checked so you can put completely false info - so why bother?) and then you get a long code to input to receive 15 mins of Wi-Fi. The whole system seems like a half baked attempt but misses the point that when you sign the register the info is not checked I wrote all my details falsely! Worst of all are the ridiculous immigration queues in today's world of modern passports with ""swipe"" magnetic strips why does it take so long to process an individual through immigration?",3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Terence Verney,Netherlands,Spacious split level airport with plenty of restaurants and seating facilities. Immigration can be a headache if you arrive around midday and in spite of 12 available aisles it can take around 30 mins to clear during peak periods. Departure is even worse and you'd be well advised to allow at least 1hr to clear immigration during peak periods in order to avoid missing your flight. Toilets are clean but there often seems to be a lack of paper hand towels. Also they don't seem to enforce the no smoking ban in the toilets and one is often greeted by the pungent smell of stale tobacco smoke. Navigating between floors can be a headache since the lift often skips a floor for no apparent reason and you end up at a different level than the intended one. Security staff subsequently refuse to allow you to use a walkway to get to the floor you intended to go to. So you're forced to return to your starting point and look for an escalator to go to the floor you actually want to reach. Only two banks available (Siam and TMB) which offer very poor exchange rates. On the plus side Thai SIM cards are available at either the AIS (1-2-Call) or DTAC (Happy) service desks on level 2. Staff will set up your mobile for you and extend the validity period if you wish to keep the same number for a subsequent visit. Provided you use the AOT taxi booths on the ground floor and pay the 50 Baht service charge you'll have no problem with the touts who hang around the upper levels looking for gullible travellers who don't know the ropes. Taxis are metered and unlike Phuket are cheap. There is also a non- stop rail link between the airport and the city centre with a flat rate fee of 150 Baht.,5,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,G Calafiore,Australia,An airport of mixed experiences. Still relatively new as far as infrastructure goes and plenty of facilities to keep one distracted during a long wait. The building itself is rather monolithic and therefore lacks the bright and airy feel of terminals like HKG and the arrivals concourse can seem rather stark. My only two gripes with this airport are: air- conditioning. It never seems to be working properly and queuing at immigration outwards and inwards. Individual queues in front of each counter is a hopeless set-up. It is frustratingly slow to the point of desperation. I wonder why they haven't set up a single queue and have the first available counter call the next person in line. Also the officers at the counters processing Thai passports only when they have cleared their queues are happy to just sit and let the foreign passport queues swell. These points aside Suvarnabhumi is a good world-class airport.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,M Brett,United States,Magnificent airport. Was flying on Swiss Business Class so I got to use the Fast track lane through customs and security. The Thai business class lounge was great and was right next to the gate. As opposed to US airline lounges the Thai lounge had a large buffet with an extensive selection of food. Can't wait to go to this airport again.,5,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Erich Koller,Switzerland,After reading all the comments I was very surprised to rush through customs in the afternoon within 15 mins only. Baggage received within 30 mins after landing. At departure we enjoyed a good check-in for our Swiss flight to ZRH had to queue a bit at customs roughly 10 mins and no waiting time at security. Duty Free much too expensive so no interest to use them. Overall pretty clean but showing some its age now. Departure gates could be a bit more customer friendly.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Richard Turnley,Australia,Although the prices in the shops are totally ludicrous and most far higher than at down town Bangkok the one good thing is that if you are flying business or first class at least with Thai you go through immigration in special express lanes that are very fast and necessary after a walk of several kilometres from the arrival gate.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,M Roberts,Thailand,I live in Thailand and use this airport quite a lot as a leisure traveller. I try to choose early morning arrivals or departures which seems to eliminate the queuing problems - I wouldn't consider a flight arriving/departing in the late morning or afternoon. Immigration officials are not very talkative even with Thai people so it might be a little unfair to comment on their seeming unfriendliness it's the way they are with everyone and is quite common with Thai officials everywhere not just at the airport. Shops are outrageously expensive compared to Thai street prices but we counter that by buying snacks & water outside the airport. Seating can also be a problem at times. Also be aware that scams and rip-offs are not uncommon at the duty-free shops and have been known to get people in trouble - items you haven't bought being put in a bag with legitimate purchases without your knowledge or as a gift unintentionally wandering outside the limits of the shop with an item you haven't yet paid for maybe to show others; both of these have been known to land travellers with the threat of prosecution and expensive fines (ie. bribes) to avoid jail. Thailand is a terribly inefficient non-customer friendly place and this airport epitomises that on the whole.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,N Collins,Bahrain,The cost of refreshments is an absolute rip off! Examples: a small bottle of Heineken beer is 180 Baht compared to 40 Baht in outside mini mart shops. A small bottle of water is 60 Baht compared to approx 7 Baht outside. Similarly the (duty free?) airport shops are pretentious and extremely expensive compared to shops outside. Thailand is well known and appreciated for its value for money therefore it is a great shame and leaves a sour taste that the airport authority's parting shot is to cynically extract the last few baht from their visiting tourists in this way.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,David Dundas,New Zealand,Arrived there for the first time at approx 10pm huge queue for immigration at least 90 mins got told by someone in the queue in front of me that they had just closed 2 booths and moved everybody over to the other ones the immigration officer was very unfriendly and said only the very minimum to me. By the time I got through immigration found my bags and found my shuttle trip it was about 12.30.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,W Brink,Netherlands,The real problems begin when you arrive at immigration. Very crowded and big lines. Took me 90 minutes to pass - really not acceptable. This makes the start of a holiday in Thailand less good and very tireful after so many hours of travelling. Few days later domestic departure with no immigration busy no big queues for security checks. For international departing I would recommend to stick to 3 hours before at the airport as immigration take 60 minutes. Overall enough shops at the airport people friendly and airport clean.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Sergio Zappulo,United Kingdom,I used to live in Bangkok so frequently travelled in and out of the old airport Don Mueng. I recently flew into Suvarnabhumi for the first time and it completely lacks any insight into the flow of people around the place. It's clumsy unintuitive and the immigration queues are obscene - at least an hour each way and lots of pushing and shoving from unorganised queues and frustrated and irritable passengers.,1,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,S Chang,United States,Like others have said immigration lines here are terrible. I've departed and entered via this airport more than a dozen times over the last 2 years and it's gotten marginally better but still bad. If you're travelling biz/1st it's no problem because you get the special Fast Trac program that has 4 dedicated passport control to serve a handful of passengers. But if you don't have the fast track it's a nightmare. The immigration officers are not friendly.,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,C Haritos,Australia,Arrived at about 9pm at night. Passport control was quick but English was poor. Airport very modern and large but easy to get around. Spacious and comfortable for a tourist.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Andrew Tucker,Australia,Things seem to have gone downhill with Suvarnabhumi a little since my last trip here but only with passing through immigration. Not sure maybe the number of arrivals has picked up? Waited about 20 minutes inbound but outbound back to Australia waited over an hour - I really cannot see the point of having such a large airport and only having 2-3 gates open - perhaps they are low on staff. Aside from that some nice comfortable areas to rest and eat in the airport prior to departure although the internet IS a little slow. Airport is an amazing design as well - lots to look at. Hope that customs/immigration can pick up their game a little before my next trip.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,R Dy,China,Arriving at almost 11 pm there were shorter queues to immigration/passport control. I noticed that the toilets are more well-maintained. Taxi queue is also efficient. However on departure horrors! First the Customs Office was not manned at all (I arrived at 10am) so I was not able to have my VAT Refund validated. I couldn't wait any further after seeing the extensively long queues to passport control and subsequently to security check. I must have queued for almost an hour. Naturally since my refund forms were not validated I was not able to get my refund back (was told I have 60 days) to claim my refund (if and when I return to Bangkok during this time frame). After reading a lot of reviews re duty free prices I decided to skip shopping. Most restaurants are filled with customers so I was not able to grab a snack and decided to wait for the inflight meal served at almost 2:30pm. Overall Suvarnabhumi Airport is comparably better with other airports in Asia (except Changi HKIA and KLIA in that order). As I am a frequent visitor to Bangkok small improvements in this airport are appreciated and hope that they remain consistent. And free wi-fi should be extended to everyone who needs it without any time usage limitations.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,R Blumm,United States,Having used this airport several times this year already I am constantly dismayed by the ever lengthening lines at immigration both going into and out of the country. The time between landing and getting out of immigration can be extremely long if you are unfortunate enough to have the double whammy of a long taxi once the plane has landed and understaffed immigration desks. Unfortunately this is not uncommon.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,D Proctor,United Kingdom,I arrived 2nd April to huge queues again (came out in July). It took me 90 minutes to get through immigration. I have travelled all over the world and I dread arriving here. My elderly parents want to come here and I have told them that with the heat and queues that they would faint. It is a horrible experience and I was alone I bet it's worse for families. Keep away if possible.,1,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,A lot of negative comments (quite rightly) about Immigration at BKK. On the plus side last time I travelled earlier in the evening (1800hrs) things were much improved in Departure Immigration (10-15mins) all desks were operational and there was no segregation between Thai and Foreign Passports. Security fine and there are now some decent seating areas close to the Gates with soft seating TV's plants etc. On Arrivals it's very much hit and miss - I've rarely taken longer than 15mins to get through Immigration baggage is still slow (30 mins from aircraft parked to bags on the belt) but there are fewer taxi touts cluttering up Arrivals. They've also done away with this ridiculous system where Landside some of the travelators were restricted to Airport Pass users (ie to get between floors you had to use the Elevators). BKK airport management have finally come to realise that the airport is there to serve the needs of the customers - not preferences of the employees. I have to agree with the earlier comment - Don Mueang was a better airport than Suvarnabhumi for the passenger.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,K Anderson,Australia,The old Don Muang airport leaves this new one for dead. Immigration lines are so slow now over an hour - used to clear customs in 10-15 min at Don Muang. Suvarnabhumi feels like a warehouse.,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,David Whalley,United Kingdom,I have read the reviews which are mainly accurate. Used the airport on several occasions in Jnauary/Feb/March. Immigration is sometimes extremely slow due almost entirely to the increase in passenger numbers. I was pleased to note there is now a priority queue for oldies (like me) and parents with young children. This saved me a long wait. One of the problems is that when new flights come in queues can get very long in seconds.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,S Smith,United Kingdom,Immigration is a nightmare. We queued for 1 hr to enter and 1.30 hr to leave. Only half the desks were manned. You would think they would do better to alleviate the queues.,1,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,James Halley,Thailand,Outbound immigration just doesn't get any better and there seems no will on the part of the Thai authorities to get a grip with the problem. I have tried morning noon and night and its still the same regardless of the time of day. Some airlines are sending out search parties to find their pax. Other airlines are advising their pax to turn up four hours before flight because of the long lines. If you are in another major city in Thailand make sure your carriers co-operate and clear outbound immigration before you get to Bangkok. Immigration in Chaing Mai means no lines no waiting and through in less than 2 minutes. And the departure lounge is less busy as it is apart from the domestic departure area.,1,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Donald Heyes,Australia,The service (or lack of it) is getting worse by the day. Long queues sometimes one and a half hours are not uncommon. I wish I could enter Thailand at another airport. When I left Thailand recently the queue at immigration was so long we had to queue outside the immigration hall. Then we found that only half the booths were being used. Then there are still so many touts at the airport trying to entice weary arrivals.,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Michel Serge,Thailand,Extremely long queues at Immigration (90 mins average) unfriendly staff expensive tax-free monopoly taxi touts at arrivals the list is endless. Avoid unless obliged to come to Thailand.,1,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,A Metcalfe,United Kingdom,Our experience was nothing but positive. We used it 4 times 2 international 2 domestic flights. It is modern clean cool and spacious. Signposted reasonably well. We were fast tracked through immigration (QR Business) and took no longer than 5 minutes - guess this improved things a lot for us. We also used the Bangkok Air lounge and Thai Silk lounge - both were ok. Loads of places to change currency. Lovely gardens to look out onto.,5,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Agastya Ngurah,Indonesia,The service cleanliness shops all satisfactory. The downers are long queue in Immigration center (Departure or Arrival) distance between the Immigration to Waiting room are too far and there's no announcement of your flights boarding outside the waiting room.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Prajwal Rimal,Nepal,"I notice the Immigration and passport staff are very poor are very rude to Indian sub- continent passenger. I noted all over the airport there were banners written with ""Airport of smiles"" - I didn't see that!",2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,J Yu,Singapore,They really need to improve the airport immigration (very slow and the lines move at different speed). Going through security can also take a long time. There is also a lack of facilities and entertainment for travelers to pass time.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Hans Schleifer,Thailand,The lousiest Airport I know. Immigration is a nightmare - last week the outgoing line at immigration was back around 300 meters. Why no line for residents?,1,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,R Bos,Malaysia,Immigration queues are a nightmare. Customs staff not friendly. Baggage doesn't arrive that fast. Taxi touts after customs. Duty free monopolized. staff English is not very good. Several toilet areas need repairs. Cleaning staff having their lunch on the floor behind the duty free shops also some make-shift offices there as well as in the immigration area. During daytime can be hot in the terminal additional aircon installed in Immigration area doesn't look very professional. Food expensive. No seating provided in the waiting area of the train to the city. No free WIFI in the terminal. A lot of improvised 'signboards' (A4-paper) can be found all looks very shabby. You have to walk a lot to get from immigration to the gate (or the other way around).,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Shane Tarr,Thailand,I don't mind the inadequate toilets here but immigration queues are terrible especially in the morning. Being forced to travel every Monday I have been forced to resort to traveling on TG Business Class to avoid the queues but obviously this is not an option for most people. It would be great if the immigration problems on departure could be rectified but I guess this is not going to happen any time soon.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,Really not sure what's going on but Departure Immigration in the late evening in BKK is getting ridiculous. Took 35 mins just to get into the Immigration Area and a further 40 mins to get to the Desk and 2 mins to get a stamp. Thankfully Security was but 5 minutes but for some reason Immigration in BKK is broken. Down at the gates flights were being held up and bags offloaded because late checking-in passengers simply weren't getting to the gate in time to make the scheduled departure time. I think there are about 20 desks in each of the 2 departure Immigration Areas... couple that with 20? International piers each with say 10-12 Check-In Desks each (that's 200+ Desks) and all of those passengers have to get their passports stamped. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out that Immigration provision is totally inadequate.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,F Svensen,Norway,Had to queue at passport control for almost 2 hours when leaving last Saturday. No organization of the queue whatsoever. This is the worst airport I know and I dread going back here.,1,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Andrew Maile,Indonesia,I passed through here at Christmas. On arrival immigration queue was OK took around 20 mins but the problem on departure was the security screening which took ages. It was quite disorganised. Generally the staff are rather unsmiling especially at immigration. The shops are very expensive.,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,N Pembry,Thailand,Midnight flight to London immigration queues out of the designated area snaking back all the way past check-in desk to the front doors! About 90 minutes to get through. Not a single member of airport staff controling the increasingly frustrated crowd or keeping people in order (ie. Chinese/Japanese from pushing in). The other side at security scanning 6 people guiding people to an x-ray machine! Ridiculous. This morning 8am flight to Jakarta again over-flowing outside the glass-walled area but queuing time down to half an hour max. I wouldn't mind so much if I was going home but I live here and have to put up with this rubbish once a month.,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,O Johansen,Norway,I am sorry for the proud Thai people. They have to face the fact that their Suvarnabhumi Airport is way behind Singapore and Hong Kong. This is strange since Thailand is always striving to be the best in aviation. One thing is to walk for 45 minutes to reach your plane or the endless immigration line. Another thing is the expensive stores trying to lure people to buy so called duty free goods. If you have time you will get everything much cheaper in the streets of Bangkok - not duty free!,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,D Wilson,United Kingdom,Allow an extra hour to get through immigration! Had to queue for 1.5 hours to exit customs/immigration as a tourist with the queues right through this so called new airport. Terrible way to treat visitors to ones country who are spending their hard earned cash. Also prevents people getting into the duty free area with time to make use of the airport facilities. Terrible system and extremely frustrating. Not sure why this is happening. Never had such a bad experience leaving a country after an amazing holiday. Terrible shame to leave a country being treated like cattle.,1,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,R Scott,United Kingdom,Check in no problem went to passport control and the line of passengers snaked well out into check in areas. I was very lucky to get to gate on time a lot of anger expressed and airline reps trying to find passengers absolute madness - especially when most of passport control desks were closed.,1,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Farouk Mogheth,Thailand,Bangkok airport certainly is and after a long time of criticism trying to work out some problems that it is facing but for me it is ignoring the most important and the one that causes most irritation. I am talking about immigration. Passport control is always in chaos. There are 2 main rush hours in the airport still struggles with very slow passport control officers and less than 50% of the pass-checks open. 55minutes on departure and 45min at arrival is just unacceptable. The marketing of Suvarnabhumi is visible in the Thai media as they are achieving faster service and with a smile. I reckon most of the passport control officers flanked the lessons. All I see at the pass desk is stickers and advertising of who supplied the camera who supplied the air freshener etc. So if I can give passport control any grade lower than zero I would. Otherwise security was better and faster the so-called duty free has lost my attention for the last 6 years so I just go through still nothing of interest close to the gates and the place there looks like a barren desert waiting at gates much better with padded seats giving the place a better look always prepare for long walks at arrival to the passport controls.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Stephen Taynton,Kazakhstan,I have often transited through this airport but never actually left the airport until this visit. For a modern airport it is a shambles - it is hard to work out where you are going in particular from the domestic to the international terminals. Additionally I do not know why an airport with so many air bridges you still have to be bussed to your plane - surely they would have thought of this when building the place. Immigration looked like a nightmare but lucky we had fast tracks and did not have to put up with the huge lines for non- Thai citizens. Overall a fabulous looking building but not user friendly.,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Dimitri Vassilakis,France,The airport is impressive  but I would rather spend less than 35 minutes queuing at immigration and have less luxury shops. The airport express link to the city is excellent  I miss old Don Muang's more traditional aspect !,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,R Leung,United Kingdom,Generally not bad but only 5 out of 16 passport control desks for foreign passport holders were opened when I went through resulting in a wait time of just over a half hour.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,P Leelamanit,Thailand,Something needs to be done at the Arrival Hall. Very chaotic and packed. The area is still very confusing and closed-off as usual. Touts are not in the arrival hall but are instead in the baggage claim area! I was asked whether or not I will get a taxi there two times! Departure: maze-like queuing system is much needed to prevent people from jumping back and forth between lines. Signage - the new black signs are much clearer. Decoration - adding more stuff in doesn't make the airport more appealing! The authority seriously needs someone with sense of style to come and decorate the airport.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,James Halley,Thailand,I transit BKK twice a month on average and on my latest outbound journey which was mid- afternoon I was horrified to see that the lines at immigration were as long as at other times of the day. The signs promoting the 20 minute wait system have been taken down. This was despite making some of the Thai passport lanes for Thai/foreign passport holders. Usual agitated people trying to queue jump with those in front standing firm and rightly so. Thai immigration needs to hire more staff. This has been a thorny issue for years and it was never that bad at Don Muang. The return journey was the best yet thanks to the plane parking near the immigration area on the D concourse and got lucky as a new officer came on duty and as everyone rushed to his desk it left my line virtually void of people.,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,Been though BKK most months this year. Passenger numbers are on the rise again and pressuring the system. Choke points now are in Immigration with lengthy queues at most times of the day. I wouldn't arrive at the airport an hour before Departure Time - you may not make it. (1/2 hour minimum getting through Immigration). They've done a reasonable job of slicking up the Security areas after Immigration and that seems to be working well. Arrivals is fine with a lower taxi tout concentration than last year. Haven't tried the Rail Link yet. Some way to go before BKK hits the standards of HKG SIN or ICN but it's getting better.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,P Metcalf,Australia,Walking to gates especially from connecting flights or reboarding a flight can be annoying but its otherwise a good airport. Passport staff quite friendly. When arriving at night it can appear a bit unprofessional many staff everywhere and many just sitting around reading filing their nails etc. Can be hard to move freely about the airport. If you venture downstairs to where the taxis are and leave your bags with your family in the arrivals area it can be hard to get back upstairs as security make it hard for you to go back upstairs and don't understand english for you to explain. Two security checks for Australian flights and staff seem good at their job. Food expensive and also souvenirs and everything else especially duty free more expensive than in a western airport - shops were mostly empty. Lots of restaurants and cafes in the departures area lots of places to sit. Free 15 minutes of internet with wifi after signing at information desk.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Ron Kuhlmann,United States,In general the airport is a pleasant experience but the walking distances can be astonishingly long. Especially for connections there can be a 15-20 minute hike involved if the gates are far apart. It is a pleasant environment and the signage is better than in many airports--a good thing as you would not want to retrace your steps.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,J Miller,Thailand,I have used Suvarnabhumi since it opened. It has improved greatly particularly the last 6 months. New trolleys. Color signage instead of only white. Refitted seats. More toilets. Airport Rail Link. The single security check after immigration was implemented to comply with new US regulations stating all airports with US bound flights originating in them must have single security check system rather than the BKK previous security check system which was divided the screenings into about 6 different areas just before each wings section (the original Thai system was better as it split up the crowd across the airport instead of into the small area near immigration as now required by US law). So people shouldn't blame the Thai people for the crowds at the security check area. People who complain about the overpriced food should list those airports with cheaper food and the list would be very short indeed. Suvarnabhummi is getting better all the time and hopefully when Terminal 2 is built they will improve on certain design faults.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,John Duffus,Thailand,How is it possible for a new airport to have so many non-airbridge parking bays? I reckon BKK has at least 40. Arriving back from PVG on a new TG A340-600 aircraft around 21:30 on Sunday evening I counted at least 15 unoccupied airbridge gates on the east side of the airport (and more on what little I could see of the west side). Yet we had to park way out on the tarmac. No dedicated first and business class buses. We were trundled half way around the airport packed into smoky smelly buses before then having to wait whilst 4 other buses unloaded their passengers at a single entry door. With this sort of experience Suvarnabhumi will never be more than a second class airport.,3,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Paul Meerman,Netherlands,At arrival long queues at immigration. Still nothing improved. At departure good shops nice to walk around clean toilets. Nice airport.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,M Rohrauer,Austria,Suvarnabhumi has improved recently. They are opening more booths at passport control and they even put cushions on the metal seats in the waiting area. Also the restrooms are reasonably clean. Food and drinks are ridiculously expensive for Thailand standards.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,S Doyle,Australia,The layout is woeful. I must have walked for about two kilometers past a ludicrous amount of duty free shops to get from one poorly signed terminal to another. Only reached my gate with 10 minutes to spare (from a 90 minute layover). They desperately need a monorail type system to move passengers from terminal to terminal quickly although the cynic in me thinks that there's a reason why they are forced to walk past all the duty free shops with their overpriced goods. Will be avoiding in future if at all possible which is a shame since I quite enjoyed my Thai Airlines flight from Melbourne.,1,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,R Riseborough,Australia,Sydney-Bangkok-Helsinki return. Only real criticism was the signage was a little confusing but for a large airport it works.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,T Moxham,South Korea,Transited through this airport twice on the weekend. Generally very good but the lighting on the lower floors is very murky. The airport monitors were also playing up. The airport appears to be enormous but both my departures on Thai involved being bussed to the plane.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Adrian O'Neill,United Kingdom,A nice airport generally but probably the most inefficient I have been to. Tthe slowest and most ill mannered immigration staff. Poor regulation of shops etc landside who seem to prey on new unsuspecting tourists ripping them off at will.,2,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,J Klakayan,United Kingdom,Beware if you're a transit passenger from domestic to international flights. The information provided and signs to follow are ludicrous. I have never yet twigged despite multiple attempts in the past 3 years. Some airlines require you to check in again at a transfer desk if you can find it. If Emirates business passenger you can get your boarding card from their lounge but impossible to find airline lounges. On arrival from abroad and business passenger walk past the customs and immigration signs immediately afterwards there are the CIP gates which you should use saving lots of queues and time. If making a domestic flight be wary of the people who ask where you are going prior to security. They are merely travel agents looking for some trade although they look very official and have nothing to do with the airport or security. Their prices are more expensive than those you could get at your destination.,4,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Erich Koller,Switzerland,My impression of BKK was positive compared to 1 year ago. We had only short queues on both arrival and departure including customs and security checks. Restrooms were clean - however we might just have been lucky this time.,4,0
bangor-airport,K Ashley,United States,There was one person in the whole airport who knew what was going on. The rest of them were rude and clue less. We missed our flight because they had 2 people working a very thorough security screening for a line of at least 120 passengers. It took them so long that we missed our flight along with about 6 other people. They are incredibly understaffed. They ended up costing us nearly $300 extra to rebook our flight and didn't offer to pay for a hotel or anything. Be thorough at security but have the staff to handle the passengers. They also claim they called everyone's names over the intercom. Not a single person heard their name. They said at first that we would not be able to leave until Monday (two days later) and that all flights were booked. Luckily two people cancelled on a flight for the next day and we were able to board. It was a nightmare to say the least.,2,0
bangor-airport,R Sincursey,United States,Pretty good airport. Nice restaurant shops and post security amenities. They recently finished a terminal expansion project which I must say looks very nice. Not many cheap airlines though. Overall good airport.,4,0
banjul-airport,N Stacey,United Kingdom,I have been travelling to the Gambia for a number of years now and the airport has declined in over the years. The airport used to be a very friendly place to travel through but now major problems with long queues at check in especially. What makes matters worse is they now charge you £18 for the privilege of it all when you leave the country and there were a lot of unhappy passengers on my last visit. It can take between 1-2 hours just to pay the money check in and go through security in utter chaos. The trouble is some of the flights are now to close together and this is a contributing factor.,2,0
banjul-airport,Nigel Stacey,United Kingdom,I have been travelling to the Gambia for six years now and have seen alot of changes at the airport over the years. Security are very friendly people. You can even sit out in the open and have a drink and a bite to eat and watch your plane land.,4,0
banjul-airport,Paul Harvey,,Just back from the Gambia again most things at the airport have not changed. However new check in procedure for your homeward flight now includes a thorough search of hand luggage and once you enter the check in area you are not allowed out again so you cannot use any airport facilities other than the departure lounge. This does of course mean you can spend longer at Luigi's !,3,0
banjul-airport,B Lakin,,"A very basic airport. Arrival reasonably speedy - agree with previous reviewer that porters can be a little overzealous with ""offering"" to help. Departures poor. Fairly quick processing of passengers through queues - but horrified that security consisted of a metal detector arch and a very cursory hand inspection of carry-on bag. Totally inadequate amount and quality of seating and dreadful toilet facilities with charter flights [predictably] departing around the same time.",2,0
banjul-airport,P Wilson,,For a west african country it is quite good with reasonable if basic facilities. The biggest problem here is the baggage reclaim for inbound passengers and the porters who do not seem to understand that some people can carry their own bags and do not require their services. The runway is one of the longest in Africa but sections of it are fairly bumpy I have landed several times here with more than a few bounces !,3,0
banjul-airport,Dave Stanley,,By African standards this is a very good airport. The building appears to be about 20 years old. Because of the tourists it caters for a lot of people. Arriving on a large aircraft will mean long queues for immigration but they do move quite quickly. Baggage claim is also a bit chaotic because the luggage carousels are not big enough. Bags are xrayed on the way out but they will give up when the queue gets too long. Most people will then be taken to a couch by their tour company. Departure procedures are OK. There might be queues at check in but no worse than any other airport. The departure lounge is OK with a few shops/bar and there is a basic business lounge on the top floor. None of the staff asked for money and were quite helpful. Overall a good experience.,3,0
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,Chris Penfold,United Kingdom,Arrived on the Virgin flight right behind the BA flight from Gatwick therefore some three hundred or so passengers going into immigration together. Queue kept moving and through within 15 minutes with all desks open. Baggage waiting once we arrived in the terminal all in all a very good arrival. On return check in fine and security efficient. This is a great airport good food and drink outlets and the usual shopping stores which I steer clear of. Used the Virgin executive lounge which was very good. Only complaint is that the windows are masked with pictures which means you have no view outside.,9,1
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,S Taylor,United Kingdom,The Queue created by immigration is a joke only 6 staff dealing with 350 people at a time. No wonder it took 1.5 hrs to get through. Must say not looking forward to departure. Tip to you all avoid this airport if you can.,,0
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,R Tomlinson,United Kingdom,We have travelled through many airports in the world this one is one of the best. Both arriving and departing were hassle free. Check ins security and passport control were quick and professional. We particularly liked being able to sit and watch the planes arrive and depart from very comfortable seating in the departure lounge nor could we fault the excellent range of facilities on offer (the washrooms very 1st class).,10,1
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,John Comissiong,Germany,The airport is pleasantly spacious breezy and clean. The departure check-in is a disaster though and waiting times on luggage in the arrivals hall very long. The currency exchange counter was un-manned even though the counter was open. So I had to return to Germany with a lot of Barbados dollars. This is quite up-setting. The queues for immigration were quite okay. Customs officers were pleasant and courteous. The immigration staff were also pleasant and friendly. Parking was no problem. The grounds are well kept & the airport is just short of beautiful to be honest. Get the service aspects in order and it could be one of the nicest in the region!,2,1
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,B Crompton,United Kingdom,Brantley Adams Barbados is now really nice airport to arrive at and depart from. We were thru customs and immigration and waiting for our taxi in 45 mins from touchdown 35 mins from leaving the plane. On our return flight we had a seat in the executive lounge which was pretty full but the general departure area on shops were very quiet with plenty of places to sit despite both BA and VIRGIN flights departing at the same time.,10,1
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,Richard Hodges,United Kingdom,Flew into BGI on 18 March on VS029 - no other planes in so about 3rd in line at immigration! Consequently quickly through luggage arrived promptly and at our West Coast accommodation within 1.5 hours. I have been there before however when Virgin BA Air Canada and American Airways have all deplaned at once. Not so much fun then. Return Flight VS030 on 1 April (Easter Monday) - no queues at check in. Didn't bother with the Airport Bars (although the bar before you go through to airside is quite nice). Once though security it is reasonably pleasant - a few souvenir and Duty Free Shops and plenty of seats. Nothing special but comfortable enough and certainly better than the 'old' BGI. Aircon could do with beefing up a bit. Oh and it's not quite a question of recommending BGI - more a question of having to use the airport as there isn't another one on Barbados!,7,1
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,Pat Marwick,United Kingdom,"The worst airport I have ever been in. Check-in was a disaster. The luggage belts weren't working because "" 'there are too many flights to deal with'. Going through passport control was a nightmare. My husband lost the little departure paper out of his passport and we were sent to fill in another one then when we tried to go to the front of the queue they made us go back. The business class lounge was heaving with people and they were having to sit on any surface available. Drinks and very poor snacks available. Then we had to queue at the gate for our British Airways flight. A lady from Air Canada got very hot and bothered because we were standing in the Air Canada 'area'. She asked us all to move and she got a lot of grief understandably - there was no Air Canada flight and nobody needed the space. Extremely poor treatment of passengers. Will avoid in future.",,0
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,Trevor R Banks,United States,"Travelled from Miami to St Vincent so had to change aircraft at Barbados. Not a lot of problems as there was an airport member at the line for immigration pointing out ""Transit this way"". You are sent to a separate immigration booth specifically for transit people. Didn't really make a lot of sense because you still had to collect your luggage and do exactly what everyone else does. If you don't have luggage then its 100% as you just leave the arrivals area and go straight to check in for your onward flight. Departure lounge area was pretty efficient with shops a bar and eats for all. If you are flying with LIAT don't believe the times on the departure board. Grab something to and drink and go straight to the departure gate. LIAT will leave when they want to.",5,1
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,Chris Stewart,United States,The airport is a good airport for what it is. The lines after you get off the plane can be long depending on when your flight gets there. The first time I visited we waited for 15 minutes as 2 other jets got there when we did. This last time we went we were late on an AA flight and we did not have to wait long. We walked right up but then waited on our luggage. Whole process took about 20 minutes. The airport is nice and clean. There is not a lot to do but I think they have Wi-Fi.,9,1
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,N Ashton,United Kingdom,I travel once a year to St Vincent via Barbados. I found the airport staff to be very rude and surly. They have no idea how to be polite to travellers. The point is if it wasn't for travellers they would not have a job. Another thing is they take your duty free away from you even when you are in transit. If you travel from England (for instance) and you are in transit you have to collect your luggage and book in with LIAT or what other airline you are travelling with and then when you check-in at customs they take your duty free that you have with you. Surely people are entitled to take their duty free to their destination. I think the airport should have a transit lounge so that travellers don't have to go outside and back in again. Its very frustrating and tiring after travelling for over 8 hours to be queuing to get your luggage then queuing again to send it to its final destination.,3,0
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,F Earl,United Kingdom,On arrival we had to queue for almost two hours to clear immigration as officials scrutinised each passenger's immigration form closely before allowing them through. Our plane carried 360 passengers and there were only six officers on duty. The forms are pointless they give you the blue copy back but then at customs another official collects them in at random. Totally pointless this looks like a job creation scheme. What a terrible first impression for visitors - I am dreading my return flight to find out what other horrors lie in store.,1,0
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,S Bond,United Kingdom,Barbados is dependant on tourism but offers a shabby welcome with unfriendly staff. I had to use the airport December 2011 to transit to Mustique. It was dirty and smelly. The premier lounge was unclean with furniture in need of repair. No fresh food two opened bottles of white wine a very unpleasant place to rest in.,1,0
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,John Jemmott,Canada,I have experienced both the old and new BGI and the new one is certainly an improvement. I have to admit I miss those little huts in a garden that used to house the duty free shopping in the landside departure area but they have a nice new sunken bar area with vegetation and I do believe a water feature. I do seem to remember long lineups at immigration before but they don't seem very bad at all now. I don't mind the lack of jetways because for me part of the whole experience is stepping off the plane and getting hit by that blast of hot air. I do however understand that it may be somewhat unpleasant if you arrive/depart in poor weather conditions. Reading through the comments I saw someone claim that one crosses a runway to get to one's plane. This is a fallacy. I also noticed a pattern that transit travellers seem to be decidedly unsatisfied with their experience. Travelling with connecting flight is generally unpleasant and often stressful and their bad experience may be more a reflection of that than a reflection of the quality of the airport. I think it is terribly unfair of them to judge an airport let alone a whole nation due to one bad experience.,5,0
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,Cristiano Miro,,I was pleasantly surprised with Grantley Adams International. Although it has no jet-ways one going up and down the stairs on the aircraft; this is an impressive facility for the Caribbean. Floors marble with drawings and mosaics. The ceilings are all but large structures of white tents. This creates a relaxed elegant atmosphere. BGI is clean (including the restrooms!). On boarding the international duty-free area is luxurious. Airport staff is pleasant and attentive including immigration agents. To round-it-up there are several good options for dining before and after security. Abundant and reliable taxi service make this a positive first and last impression; for the fortunate visitors to this beautiful island.,4,0
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,A Morris,,Travelling through Barbados airport on my way to and from St Vincent & The Grenadines ruins the start and finish of every holiday. The staff are surly and bombastic all Liat flights to SVG I am booked on are delayed with absolutely no information given out by the staff. at least one piece of hold luggage will always not be put onto your connecting flight. Now we send all our luggage by sea and just carry hand luggage. Also why can't anyone speak clearly over the tannoy?,1,0
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,Ian Norris,,BGI is a good airport to get through quickly especially given the two flights that came through at the same time. Only problem is lack of trolleys if you've a large number of bags to carry although you can get the trolley guys to help you (at a cost). On the way out there were no queues at all for BA and the security staff are actually friendly and not jobsworths (helping us with out two year old) - take note UK staff. A few shops to spend your last Bajan if need be and lots of space and seating.,4,0
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,Rob Horrell,,Be very cautious when considering a holiday or flight in/out of Barbados airport. The staff break open suitcases even when locked padlocked and a locking strap around them. We flew back from there last Sunday evening to the UK - to find two of our suitcases damaged. Missing electrical items including camera with holiday pictures.,1,0
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,Charles Smith,,"Arrival into Barbados 16th June 2007 from London Gatwick with Virgin Atlantic. This being my 7th time to this airport I have grown used to its ""unique experience"" however I was in for a pleasant surprise as this was the first time I had been here since the overhaul of the arrivals and departures facilities. These were immediately visable as were were taxied iinto the gate. Still no jetways in sight. Passengers use steps to board/disembark. The new air conditioned immigration facilities mean one fast moving queueing system to all immigration booths as opposed to individual queues of varying lengths to each immigration booth. A new air conditioned reclaim area with working belts is a breath of fresh air for weary air travellers. Licenced airport taxis are available at the outdoor meeting point immediately after customs clearance. We were approached by several touts who tried to coax us over to their cars in the car park however we insisted on a licenced cab which advertise their rates to all the main points on the island in BDS$ and US$ at the meeting point. The overall impression to arriving passengers is now one of a well run and efficient airport. Departure back to Gatwick on 30th June 2007 also a pleasant improvement over the old. Extended check in facilities run the length on one half of the departures area and then run as far into the terminal itself. Departure tax is now collected at the time of purchasing your ticket so no need to keep $25 in cash handy for leaving the island. The only downside to the revamped departures area is that there isn't a great deal of seating before going through security. The new immigration and security screening point is also air conditioned and queues were managed well to allow 4 wide bodied jet loads of passengers to pass through seamlessly without too much delay. New retail outlets are positioned after security which all passengers have to walk past in order to approach the gate areas. All jet departures board from this gate area where there are plenty of seats. There is also a small VIP lounge airside which allows you to buy access on the day (subject to availability) for BD$40 per person. Regional prop flights board from their original ""open air"" gates however regional passengers still wait in the same area as international passengers. There are also extension ""remote"" gates with shuttle busses to/from the aircraft for when the airport gets really busy. Toilet facilities clean however sparse in number. In summary a thoroughly pleasant experience only let down by by a few niggles. a complete change in experience from my expectation. It now feels like an efficient airport facility.",4,0
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,Clare Doyle,,I have never been to such a chaotic airport with so little customer service and following our experiences on 16th December 2006 we hope never to have to travel to/via Barbados again. Late arriving connection flights are a standard issue in today's travel world but to find no transit facility and an hour-long immigration queue when you only have an hour left to departure following the delay is beyond frustration. Why does an airport that has so many transit passengers not provide a transit facility. Many people on our incoming flight from Grenada/Tobago missed their connections and we only caught ours due to persistent nagging of the Information Desk staff one of whom was charming the other disinterested and the goodwill of Virgin Atlantic possibly enhanced by the fact that we had checked in online from Grenada in the morning. I will recommend to everyone I meet that they do not travel to/via Barbados in future. I can understand congestion and extenuating circumstances but the complete lack of interest from the majority of staff was incomprehensible and totally adverse to tourist relations. The stress caused by this experience at the end of our holiday to the beautiful island of Grenada almost totally destroyed the benefits of a relaxing Caribbean holiday. The fact that no-one can be bothered to reply to my emails requesting an explanation of the issues only compounds the issue.,,0
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,Mark Williams,,"The new expansion really in an improvement - as are the new luggage belts - if only people would leave bags that don't belong to them on the belt! I eventually found our second bag amongst a pile of others that had been removed and dumped! There are a lot of improvements that could be made such as a single queue for immigration services by all the desks rather than the current shambles where you pick the queue you think will be the best - I'm able to use the locals queue but it's regularly a source of annoyance amongst other passengers! I've not had a problem with check in but we normally check in early and either visit friends or go for a drink. It can be hard after 8 hours in a plane from the UK to remember that you have arrived in a country where ""western"" ideas of timeliness and service aren't really going to fit in - my experience is that the airport staff have two speeds and if you don't like the one they are working at now you are going to hate the other one! My only major gripe is customs - why is there always one really unhelpful rude and ill mannered woman trying to see to a whole line which often contains passengers from several big planes all at once!",,0
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,Jim Thomson,,"I have been through Grantley Adams twice in the last month. It looks as though it will have a very nice landside terminal when the the work is finished and once through security the (I hope) temporary shopping arrangements will improve once the new units are finished. Things must have moved on quite a bit since October because the airside waiting areas at the gates seemed adequate with four wide-bodies on the stands and no sign of overcrowding. Improvements could be made in the way that check-in queues are managed with handling agent staff positioned at the entry to the queues rather than down at the desk end. On the second occasion I used the airport the signage above the desks clashed with airline information displayed on the monitors above them and resulted in some annoyance among people in the wrong queues - hence the comment about need for agents at the tail end of a queue. The public address system could also be improved (they REALLY need a good sound engineer to sort out the audio). There also seems to be a problem with the way airlines access the PA system. It would be better if there was a single person making all the announcements. That would reduce the variation in announcement ""styles"" (some barely decipherable) and techniques (some too close to the microphone and some to far away) and would ensure that all announcements were aired. One last improvement would be the change of access to the business lounge so that it was from airside rather than landside. That would make it a much more relaxing place because users would already be through security and not have to judge when to join the security queue so that they would be on time for boarding. I suppose the down side of that would be that the lounge would need to be bigger to accommodate a greater number of users. Overall a fairly average airport experience that will improve once the building is completed.",,0
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,Kim Moore,,I use the Grantley Adams airport regularly and it is as efficient as any other airport in the Caribbean. It is bigger and more organized than other island airports. I have encountered problems and long waits but I have learnt to check-in a couple of hours before hand. I have encountered similar problems at JFK but that to me does not reflect on the island as a whole. It is an airport so there will be delays and crowds. All in all Barbados is a great place one of the best islands in the Caribbean and a great get away spot.,,0
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,Claus Heins,,Mr Dabney you are right when they opened Grantly Adams it might have been one of the best in the Caribbean. I have been in and out the Caribbean for 15 years now. Since my first arrival a lot of other airports in the area have been upgraded: Port of Spain Fort-de-France Point-a-Pitre Santo Domingo. They all can handle more planes than BGI. Today BGI is crowded staff is not the friendliest almost no shops and the departure area is an overcrowded nightmare if you have to handle more than 747 back to LON at the same time (The problem is that all flights to Europe leave around the same hour and you can have 5 of them at a time!). Same counts for baggage handling for incoming flights from Europe. The two or three belts (with one under repair most of the time) are a joke.,,0
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,Jeremy Gray,,Grantley Adams Airport has had the necessary upgrade - pity that they could not improve the quality of the announcements (still very echoey!) - distinct lack of fresh water available and finally why are the prices of alcohol in the duty free departure area significantly higher than the prices in the duty free area in arrivals?,,0
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,Jeanne Miller,,Horrific! A mass of people in one line for 3 hours in 90+ degree heat just waiting to check in only to join another 25 minute line to get through security. No air conditioning no water anywhere no seating absolutely no airport personnel visible. Why a single line for several airline ticket counters? USAir had slips of paper tacked up to indicate their counter space. Ticket agents were rude and slow. Be advised you may have a long walk to the airplane (across the runway) carrying your child & your carry on luggage - and will have yet another security checkpoint to pass. The plane was so late taking off that people were told to just run to their connecting flights and forget their luggage - it would be delivered the next day. So much for Barbados. Never again.,,0
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,Robert Dabney,,"I have been traveling in and out of Barbados since 1960. In the intervening forty plus years I have arrived and departed from the old Sewell International Airport and since 1979 Grantley Adams International Airport. Since the opening of GAIA I have transited the facility more than 30 times. Have I had any unpleasant experiences? Of course. I cannot name ANY international airport or cruise terminal where I have not encountered problems on at least one visit. However I am compelled to say that the Barbados facility is one of the best most modern facilities in the Caribbean. There are few airports in the region with the capability both in terms of terminal and runway to handle all components of major airline fleets from the B747 to until recently Concorde. The current expansion programme brings to mind renovations at many international facilities worldwide. Yes there are inconveniences that must be endured. But these must be seen in the light of ""temporary setbacks for permanent improvement."" My personal pet peeve with GAIA has been the lengthy walk from planeside upon arrival to the immigration and customs areas. But when put up against the walk to immigration when arriving in San Juan Puerto Rico on American Eagle Airline I'll take Barbados any day. I applaud the comment from Mr. St. John of the airport authority that one of the conditions to be attached to the letting of new vending contracts at the completed airport will be the requirement that restaurants be open as long as there are passengers in the terminal. This has long been a problem as pointed out by other posters to this forum. I would urge passengers arriving at GAIA to remember that you are not in New York or London or Frankfurt. You are arriving in the Caribbean! The lifestyle is slower (not a BAD thing!!) and the people friendly. Enjoy your visit to the airport. Take in the lush vegetation that is all around you. Enjoy the sounds sights and smells. And let your arrival be the harbinger of a wonderful visit to follow.",,0
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,Mark Hatton,,Barbados Airport isn't too bad if you realise that you are in the Caribbean and you have to appreciate the fact that the pace of life is very slow rushing is one word that does not exist here - unlike our western sociteies. Therefore it is wise to come prepared and be patient when i got there the bags took over 1 hour to come through off the plane which is irritating but hey relax! The airport is undergoing some major re-vamping yet this is very slow going and I do not know when this will finish! A really bad point is the fact there is no flight information once you get through immigration its hard to see if you are delayed or if your flight is cancelled (like what happened to me trying to get to Port-of-Spain in Trinidad). Highly frustrating are two words that come to mind. Like I said though generally speaking if you come prepared it isnt all that bad.,,0
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,Bruce Doyle,,I've vacationed in Barbados sixteen times and have never had a problem at the airport in any capacity. I find the airport quite adequate and with the current terminal construction which is ongoing the facilities can only improve. My first experience was in 1969 when the terminal was the now cargo facility. Since then much improvement has taken place. I think people have to realise that they're in the Caribbean and learn to ease up and relax.,,0
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,Sian Williams,,Barbados airport is appalling. The check in staff are rude the shops are non existent. We were travelling business class with BWIA and the check in staff told us the business lounge was through departures - having gone through we were told that this was not true and the lounge was in the main terminal and we could not go back!!! Our flight was delayed by 3 hours so had to sit in grotty plastic seats for nearly 6 hours with nothing to eat or drink as the shops had shut - we would never go back!,,0
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,Matthew Clarkson,,This airport is absolutely dreadful. The facilities are basically non-existent both in the arrivals and departure areas. It was not even possible to buy a bottle of water when we arrived at 10:45pm. On departing after security there is a small seating area that should really be demolished. All shops had closed by 10:00pm. To be fair they are obviously renovating the entire facility but the basic amenities should still be provided.,,0
barcelona-airport,C Rogers,Ireland,Have travelled extensively all over the world and this was the worst airport experience I've had. Completely out of control queues for passport control. No staff assisting with these passengers starting arguments with each other due to stress. Missed my flight due to these queues. First time in my life to miss a flight. Arrived in reasonable time. Feel it was due to poor staffing and organisation of airport that this happened. I am sure a lot of people missed flights today. When this happens (missed flight) they only want you to get out with no assistance offered.,,0
barcelona-airport,V Adams,United Kingdom,We have had very bad experiences at Barcelona airport. When we arrived we had problems with the help desk when querying our transfer. They were nothing short of unhelpful and actually quite rude. When departing our flight was cancelled due to an air traffic control strike and our treatment in the airport by airport staff and Ryanair staff was appalling. We were made to wait there all night in a queue without anyone coming to speak to us or offer us so much as a drink of water. All catering facilities shut and the airport help desk could not be more unhelpful and were incredibly rude. Even the security guard was rude when I reported a crime being committed that I had witnessed. The staff couldn't care less they may as well not be there. As the first people I met when I entered the country they created an appalling impression of Spanish hospitality.,,0
barcelona-airport,R DeFrutos,United States,Excellent Airport great food and places to shop. Much better than most airports of the same size. Rather to connect in BCN than LHR.,9,1
barcelona-airport,Juanjo Pinol,Spain,I fly quite often for business and as I live in Barcelona always fly from BCN airport so I'm really surprised by some of the reviews with such bad marks. I love BCN airport easy to fly from here lot of shops places to eat modern very clear - so much better than other airports in Europe or USA. For those who fly from gates E & D it's a very clear sign before customs that from that point you can't go backwards and they invite you to go downstairs to shopping area before so easy to see the signs. Staff as friendly as in other airports. My only complaint is that lately luggage delivery takes too long (they need to improve that).,8,1
barcelona-airport,Carl Lachmann,Sweden,Electricity and internet - air and water in 2015. Come on wake up. In 2015 any airport should offer easy to access free wifi and many places to charge your phone pad pc. Sad to see Barcelona lingering - shape up!,,0
barcelona-airport,N Gupta,United Kingdom,Travelling from Barcelona to London Heathrow we were sent to Passport Control as we are non Shengen and then on to Gate D and E area. It is very sad that there is absolutely nothing to do there except stare into the shops and restaurants below. The airport should have some way for D and E gate passengers to go downstairs. Usually D and E gates are catering to non Schengen area / international passengers with more to spend! Surely Spain Airport Authorities should wake up and realise this potential! Overall the airport is bright and airy and nice just like any other but the lack of food and drink opportunities or shopping opportunities is a shame.,2,0
barcelona-airport,R Power,United Kingdom,I have never encountered such rudeness! Quite unbelievable how they think it is fine to shout at you. I was trying to take my things out of the tray at customs and the female member of staff was shouting loudly at me in Spanish - I explained that I didn't understand. Her response was to shout: 'Take it to the table - I'm speaking English Do you understand now?' Other staff were all generally very unhelpful/rude on both arriving and leaving the airport. It really has put me off going again.,,0
barcelona-airport,N Walker,United Kingdom,Have to agree with all the other annoyed and frustrated Gates D and E passengers. Yes the airport is light and airy and modern - yes check-in and security is quick and easy - and yes getting to and from the airport on the Aerobus is efficient. But from then on it falls down - poor signage leads you into airport hell. After security there is nothing to indicate that you need to go down the escalators to reach all the gorgeous glamorous shops they are so proud of - if you follow signs through passport control into your zone (D or E) you'll be trapped with nothing but a McD's and an expensive coffee bar for comfort while you watch everyone else enjoying themselves downstairs in freedom-land from your glass box.,3,1
barcelona-airport,T Harvey,Canada,Landing in BCN's T2 and spending 1 hour before a connecting flight was a very smooth experience. The high ceilings brightness of the place and the spacious shops and food outlets added to the positive experience. The only negative thing was the lack of maps about the terminal and a listing of shops/services and the location of gates. Even one of the information stands didn't have this visible in a brochure format.,8,1
barcelona-airport,Kevin Halouska,Spain,Terminal 1. Arrived on Swiss from Zurich at 22.30 on 25th October. Barcelona airport ground handling is near the worst in Europe! Once again on arriving the checked in bags took well over 45 minutes to arrive. Unfortunately this is standard for this airport in the past 3 years I have used it.,5,1
barcelona-airport,A Boyes,United Kingdom,Worst airport experience. On arrival checked in and followed directions to gate D which directed us straight through security which seemed normal only to find that we ended up on a 1st floor offering small duty free shop a McDonalds and a small cafe. Looking down below there was huge amount of shops and restaurants which we had so looked forward to exploring to find that we could not get access to because we had cleared security and passport control. Needless to say we were really annoyed as this was a part of our holiday that we looked forward to and taking advantage of duty free shops that we should have been entitled to. On asking we where told that sorry but nothing can be done. I explained the set up directed gate D passengers straight through passport control and after this it was too late. I watched the following 30 minutes (as I tried to accept the situation) the huge amount of people that frantically tried to find there way down to the shops with no success and feel that this was a huge disappointment to us and other travellers and think that this airport has no respect for the people travelling through this airport.,,0
barcelona-airport,Helen Devries,Costa Rica,On a recent trip to Spain I used Terminals 1 and 2. Terminal 1 check-in area could do with considerably more seating but apart from that it gave a good experience - security was fast operated by pleasant staff signage was good and all went well both on arrival and departure. Terminal 2 likewise - all in all an easy airport to negotiate with pleasant staff.,10,1
barcelona-airport,Tony Quinn,United Kingdom,Nice airport that we have been using for over 40 years. We used T1 for the first time and whilst the terminal was fine the Shuttle bus between T1 and T2 was hair raising. I think the driver thought he was Fernando Alonso. Fast driving and hard braking was the order of the day together with what felt like cornering on two wheels. The quicker they finish the Metro link the better. If you're using the shuttle hold on tight because it could be a rough ride.,7,1
barcelona-airport,Tony McGregor,United Kingdom,This airport makes you glad to be leaving. What a disaster zone D and E are. No information telling you once you enter here that you can do nothing else. All the shops are downstairs which you cannot get to once entering here. Nobody cares enjoy your 3 hours with nothing to do in a holding pen.,4,0
barcelona-airport,M Needs,United Kingdom,Flew from Terminal last week and found that contrary to previous Post the Airport works very well and is clean. No problems at Security and BA departure from the D Gates was easy to find. All in all a good experience.,9,1
barcelona-airport,Peter Dori,United States,Classical demonstration of the Spanish failure. So much money spent on this airport and yet one of the most disorganized and annoying places on earth. Signs are pointing in different directions. If you were sent to gates e or d you are doomed. No access to any store and 2 restaurants. A small bottle of coke is 3 euros - such a poor experience.,,0
barcelona-airport,A Yardley,United Kingdom,Beware of pickpockets working in the airport particularly when getting the Aerobus. We had all our money stolen as we got onto the bus. A man and women work together one distracts you while the other steals your possessions. There are no signs warning you so please take care! We saw no security staff working near this area although the airport officials must be aware or the problem.,3,0
barcelona-airport,S Knight,United Kingdom,Terminal 2 - A most pleasant experience. I had assistance and found the staff very professional and helpful. In fact I couldn't fault them at all. Wifi was free for 15 minutes.,10,1
barcelona-airport,C Jordan,Argentina,Terminal 1. Very fast and efficient immigration and customs on arrival. Good signage easy to get around with helpful information desks throughout. Fast track for security at departures and good business lounge though stocked only for short stays short selection of drinks and even smaller for food. Wifi: dodgy at best. Overall impression: clean bright pleasant.,10,1
barcelona-airport,J Tung,United Kingdom,Overall a good/clean airport with plenty of shopping. The business lounge was spacious and nice with plenty of seating. The biggest problem with this airport is the traffic to city centre. If you are flying low cost airlines there is a direct train (not as frequent and does feel like an airport express although for the price one shouldn't complain). However for all other airlines (if you are using the better and new terminal) you will have to get a free bus outside terminal 2 to terminal 1 and then a short walk to the train station.,6,1
barcelona-airport,J LaDuke,United States,I'm staying here for 24 hours waiting for the next flight to the US and all I can say is where are the power outlets. There are no convenient ways to charge your electronics the only outlets I could find were in the bathrooms and an open slot between two soda machines. Also the food selection isn't very good. I got a sandwich that seemed to have just raw bacon and tomatoes on it for 5 euros.,3,0
barcelona-airport,L Besso,Switzerland,business lounge is nice. However I sincerely regret that they are no fast track for business or first passengers. Queues for the security are to long and the dispatching team absolutely not friendly.,7,1
barcelona-airport,J Lendain,France,Bright and modern airport with good bus connections to downtown Barcelona. Very good experience.,9,1
barcelona-airport,Nicolas Simonis,Greece,In reading some of the reviews I simply wonder if these pax have ever visited this lovely airport one of the nicest airports I have ever seen. Huge well designed signs everywhere very willing personnel excellent shopping area in fact I find no reason to complain apart from my pre-booked pre-paid taxi service (Aerocity) who had instructed me to proceed to their office on the lower lever their office however was closed and they never bothered to phone me. Wasted two hours trying to obtain their disappointing service whilst on our departure date they never showed up! BCN airport is simply great with moving walkways (something they missed when building Athens airport) fantastic shopping ideas and shops. Check in on Vueling was very fast. One thing I did not like is the fact that boarding gate was not given until an hour after check in.,8,1
barcelona-airport,D O'Hara,Ireland,In my opinion airports should be user friendly with architecture and design a secondary feature. I never noticed its architecture - just the distances between locations lack of signage and generally unhelpful rude staff. Arrived this week with 2 elderly passengers to pick up pre-booked car. Nobody could direct me to the car-hire desk - not even the airport information desk - just a general wave of the hand in the direction of a bus shelter uttering 'shuttle bus'. Several shuttle buses arrived - red/yellow/white/blue which one/confusion/frustration - eventually 2 hours after arrival car sorted. No consideration for elderly passengers - shrugging shoulders/not my issue type of attitude. On departure a few days later much the same with sparse signage which led to more frustration and time wasting. Staff giving different directions - downstairs - then upstairs - to the right - to the left. At the top of the escalator - two signs in two completely different directions saying 'Security/Departures' - no one to advise which route to take. Doesn't help when time is of the essence and elderly passengers trying to walk as quickly as possible. Would have to compliment an assistant who worked at a perfume counter at duty free who directed my party through a 'short-cut' to the boarding gate - without her help we would have missed our flight. Caters for young agile Spanish speaking community - not elderly friendly. BCN is definitely off my list of airports I will never use it again.,2,0
barcelona-airport,M Jelmorini,Netherlands,Terminal 2. They opened only two counters for check-in for our flight 2 hours before departure. There was a very long queue of passengers. The lady at our counter was working very slowy it took her about 5-10 minutes per customer to complete the procedure. All the time she was staring at her computer screen. The check-in of a lady in wheelchair lasted about 20 minutes. A couple with a kid in a buggy also took a lot of time. We had to wait an hour to check-in. Behind us there were dozens of people still waiting. There was no supply of information. When we arrived at our gate already past boarding time because the check-in took so long we saw that the plane hadn't yet arrived. But on the information boards there was no sign of delay. I went to the ladies room and it was the most horrible toilet I've seen. Personnel (at the counter at the coffee corner at the security) was very unfriendly and seemed very unhappy working there.,3,0
barcelona-airport,S Hanna,United Kingdom,Terminal 2. Horrible experience. Poor information service staff very rude everybody gives different information. Me and my husband checked in and got our tickets stamped and were sent upstairs for control and to boarding gate. It all took a while because of an enormous queue. Than we get to the boarding gate and gave our tickets to stewardesses. They returned our tickets and said it is too late all passengers went to the plane already (plane was due to depart in 10 mins) and we have to buy another tickets to another city. Shocked because we'd gone through so many checks and didn't hear any call from megaphones nothing that mentioned our destination. We have been told that they do not call passengers. We ended up loosing our tickets. Very stressful and upsetting experience.,,0
barcelona-airport,T Morton,Spain,Its ironic that Barcelona with its reputation for good food should have the poorest airport food offering of anywhere in Spain or just about anywhere I know of. Some lucky cheap sandwich supplier clearly has the monopoly on food supply since no matter which bar you head for they have the same grotty selection of sandwiches and dry bocadillos.,2,0
barcelona-airport,Patrick Tan,Malaysia,Arriving from Rome with Vueling.com into Barcelona I have to admit that I really love this airport. It was huge and modern plus the atmosphere was really nice. It was really easy to get around to the city with the bus and train services available. It was a little inconvenient though to travel from Terminal 1 to 3 which I seriously think they have to do something about it quickly. Workers here are all fine except a little slow at the check-in counters. Overall very satisfied with the airport.,6,1
barcelona-airport,Aaron Jones,Australia,Terrible service by all staff who were rude and obviously unhappy about working there. Security was a complete shambles. Avoid this airport.,1,0
barcelona-airport,Magdalene Chin,Singapore,Terminal 1 is frankly a modern well-designed airport with the usual features of a good international airport. The check-in was smooth was opened exactly 3hrs before boarding time. However this being the 2nd time I'm flying out of this airport I have to downgrade my rating of 7.5 to a rating of 3 for extremely poor service all round in particular by the service staff manning the Information Counters and the personnel handling the Tax Free counters. I was especially disconcerted by the way the personnel treated tourists who needed help understanding the tax free process. On both occasions when I used this service the staff were downright rude and gruff when politely asked about next steps in the process. A modern fine airport marred by unprofessional staff. My entire experience of Barcelona was affected by this last stop at the airport.,3,0
barcelona-airport,O Jones,United Kingdom,Dreadful poor information and having to travel by shuttle bus to different terminals was a nightmare we had to rely on fellow travellers to help us due to no info supplied by airport.,2,0
barcelona-airport,Sahil Muliyil,United States,This airport is horrible. There are no power outlets anywhere very little options for food and people seem to not know where anything is or how anything works.,1,0
barcelona-airport,J Knack,United States,We arrived in Barcelona from JFK in New York. The difference in the airport is stunning. JFK is dark dirty and unappealing. Barcelona is clean bright and an welcoming place to begin your time in the city. Customs and immigration very smooth. Many US airports could take a lesson.,10,1
barcelona-airport,A Lane,United States,I concur with the other reviews of Terminal 2 that say it is a horrible terminal it surely is. The walk is quite long to get to the baggage arrivals area. Worse are the security staff who acted in an unprofessional manner checking us whilst laughing. Nothing at all is funny about security checks so these clowns should be sacked. The immigration official on duty was disinterested and frankly acted very inconvenienced that passengers had actually disturbed her from reading her novel. Terminal 2 is a disaster. It had many closed shops and restaurants. There was but one place to buy a few items like water and reading material. The dining choices were so poor we had to settle for an overpriced meal at the one establishment that passed for an okay type of cafe but had very little menu offerings.,1,0
barcelona-airport,T Hess,United States,Terminal 1 is possibly the cleanest and most relaxing international airport I have ever had the pleasure to fly through. The Terminal is open and clean. Announcements are kept to a minimum in the Terminal which contributes to a nice relaxing experience. From deplaning it is a pleasant walk through some nice shopping areas to baggage claim and onward. Speaking of baggage claim the area is large and open which prevents much of the clustering and crowding you will find at other airports. Signage is adequate and there are numerous Information Kiosks should you have a question. Note airport hotels are not marked as well but a simple stop by the Information Kiosk will reveal easy to follow directions. Note: all of my arrivals were from Schegen Countries so I cannot attest to incoming the Customs experience. The range of food selection isn't spectacular but you should be able to find something. Locating the Terminal connection bus was not difficult. Locating the Train station was easy. Be aware that Terminal 2 is like an airport in a third world country and takes about 10 or so minutes to reach by shuttle bus. Departing from Terminal 1 is easy although I do not prefer the separation of Terminal areas because you are then limited to food/shopping choices once you pass through Customs. This is however fairly common so it shouldn't come as a surprise. Finding your check in gate is simple enough (check monitors) and the security screening was a moderate wait. It was a pleasure passing through this airport on a few occasions recently.,10,1
barcelona-airport,Cesar Alonso,Spain,I use Barcelona airport quite often and the new T1 I think is a very good concept. Easy to reach everywhere very good shopping areas and restaurants no long distances to/from boarding gates and parkings-taxis etc.,10,1
barcelona-airport,Dmitry Kuzin,Russian Federation,BCN Terminal 1 is comfortable and looks modern. Everything is organised the signs are easy to notice. The line for immigration was so short and quick the security were efficient. Baggage claim took minutes upon arrival and the check-in was real quick before departure. I liked spacious waiting areas and plenty of shops with reasonable prices. I can recommend El Prat for trips to Barcelona and as a transit airport to go somewhere else.,8,1
barcelona-airport,I Correll,United States,BCN. Notified of the departure gate 15 minutes before the scheduled flight departure and with no planes at the terminal all passengers were forced to scurry down a two story circular staircase with carry on luggage in hand. We were then crammed onto a bus that took us out to the plane where we had to climb the ladder up to the plane door. The overall service is pathetic. BCN is functioning in the past as far as service is concerned. You would do well to avoid this airport if at all possible.,,0
barcelona-airport,E Crookston,United Kingdom,T2 at Barcelona airport is one of the worst terminals I have ever flown from  it is badly sign posted the security staff were rude most of the shops have closed down  we were charged 60 euros for a meal that was pretty much inedible and to top it off my flight was delayed for 4 hours so endured a 6 hour stay in this awful terminal.,1,0
barcelona-airport,Gerry McGrath,Ireland,Terminal 2 is an absolute dump - a depressing way to leave Spain. Very little seating so no consideration shown for elderly disabled pregnant women families with small children or worn-out travellers of any age or condition. We were a family travelling with elderly grandparents and while the special assistance staff were prompt and helpful everything else about the experience was tiresome and miserable. They have acres of space and just a handful of seats/benches. The coffee bar we used was a rip-off and overpriced coffee served in cardboard. Tables and chairs packed so tight there was no room to manoeuvre baggage. Outside temperatures were around 34C that day but AirCon was barely functioning. I can't speak about Terminal 1 as I haven't passed through it for at least 5 or 6 years but I doubt that the service standards are much higher. It pains me to say that while I love Spain and its clever charming people generally speaking they don't do customer service well compared to other nations. Travelling as we do every year through Barcelona 2 however we have met some of the rudest snarling staff.,1,0
barcelona-airport,E Mullen,Ireland,Arrived into and departed from Terminal 2. Arrival was relatively OK although trying to locate car hire desk when you arrive in through Section A wasn't easy as they're located in Section C and signage is non existent. Departure through Terminal 2 is awful. Over 100 check in desks to service 50 departing flights but only 42 were in operation. Many of the shops both landside and airside were closed up. I first used BCN when there was only one terminal - this one. I feel that this terminal has suffered since Iberia relocated to new terminal.,5,0
barcelona-airport,A Cheung,China,"As mentioned by others (which unfortunately I did not read earlier) departure from Terminal 1 gates D and E puts you on an upper floor with a lot of empty space and hardly any facilities and there was no warning except a sign at passport control that says something like ""point of no return"". So if you want a bite to eat or do some last minute shopping before boarding follow the signs to Gates A B and C after security check instead before passing passport control to go to gates D or E. By the way passport control is manned by the rudest people who badly need some basic training in manners. It was as if they were there to ensure visitors leave Spain with a bad impression and not to return for future visits. Seriously they ought to travel around the world a bit and maybe they will learn something. Otherwise BCN Airport is like many airports of big cities. It is clean modern but a very boring place. If you want free wifi you can get 15 min use if you sign up for the service but it is not worth the trouble.",2,0
barcelona-airport,C Ong,Singapore,Beautiful and clean. Amazing architecture and so pleasant to be in after a long flight.,10,1
barcelona-airport,D Daley,United Kingdom,I arrived through Terminal 1 at Barcelona and it was a pleasant experience but departing through Terminal 2 was a complete nightmare. For starters airport cleaners were on strike so there was rubbish and rotting food on almost every surface and the toilets clearly had not been cleaned in days (wash hand basins full of plastic sacks with nappies in etc). Security was good but when I finally got airside I realised that as many airlines had moved to the new terminal 1 most of the shops and restaurants had closed down airside. In fact my walk to the M5 non Schengen boarding area which used to involve a pleasant walk down a shop and cafe lined street now involved walking down a dingy alley of boarded up shops. I used to enjoy using this airport but now it is a very unpleasant and depressing experience.,3,0
barcelona-airport,Y Ren,Australia,Arrived at BCN new terminal from SVO. Very new and modern building very easy to go through immigration. Luggage arrived a little bit late after we landed. Skybus is the best way to get into city centre for a reasonable price. Departure is also very easy. Check-in was smooth security check was pretty easy staff friendly and helpful. All in all a great experience to go through BCN.,9,1
barcelona-airport,Adrian Williams,Switzerland,Just plain awful. I wish I'd found this website sooner. Drive take a train travel by boat do anything except depart from Barcelona T1 gates D or E. Once through passport control you cannot access any of the shops restaurants or any other facilities available to people flying from gates A B or C. There is nothing to warn you of this (April 2012) and there is no way back. Staff unhelpful police aggressive. Nothing at gates D and E except a McDonalds the usual duty free a newsagent and a cafe serving awful sandwiches. Avoid.,2,0
barcelona-airport,Paul Van Alsten,France,"Arrived and departed intra-Schengen from terminal T1. Bright and modern airport with good bus connections to downtown Barcelona - one-way ticket costs €5.30 buses run frequently. Note that the train station is across terminal T2 thus requiring a shuttle ride between T1 and T2. Upon departure check-in was hassle-free - using self-service machines. Main security checkpoint in the centre of the terminal is often overcrowded. It is more pleasant to use the secondary checkpoint leading to boarding area C which is usually empty (Just follow the ""Regional flights"" sign). Extensive seating areas at the boarding gates. Lavatories spotlessly clean. Major downside is the quite long walking distance from piers A and C to the main building.",8,1
barcelona-airport,Paul Kazan,United Kingdom,Can only echo what other reviewers are saying. You check-in your bags go through passport control - as in all other airports around the world - and find that Duty Free/Restaurants and 99% of facilities are blocked off as they are downstairs but before passport control. Don't expect anything but rudeness from airport staff although they must be sick of the system themselves.,6,0
barcelona-airport,Gerome Mortelecque,Brazil,For the first time I arrived and left from Barcelona for an intercontinental flight and I was impressed by T1 in BCN. At customs a couple (French + Brazilian passports) went through rapidly without having to line up. Baggage started to be delivered when we arrived to the carrousel and our flight arrived 30 min earlier. On our return flight checking in was without problem and fast. Customs and security were all open and facilitating a fast process. Enough seats at the waiting areas a lot of shops and coffee shop/restaurants. I don't know if it is like this every day but if so congratulations.,5,0
barcelona-airport,A Bernard,United Kingdom,Terminal 1 is large bright and airy with plenty of staff. However the really crazy arrangements of Gates D and E mean that once through passport control you cannot take advantage of the excellent range of shops - only a duty free and newsagent! There is a sign inviting you to take advantage of shopping but it does not point out the significance.,2,0
barcelona-airport,J Watkins,United Kingdom,Barcelona Airport was one of my favourite airports in Europe what is now terminal 2 had some of the best shops cafe's bars duty free. In fact it had the lot in a very large area and was clean and very efficient. Now most of the shops are closed areas are blocked off some staff are clearly unhappy especially in the over priced coffee shops and are quite rude to customers. There is a sign that tells you that you cannot go back through passport control in one area but it tells you when you are already through There were crowds of people trying to get in so the duty fee closed before they could get to them do not travel from terminal 2.,1,0
barcelona-airport,L Frederic,Germany,Terminal 1 is wonderful. Very bright a lot of glass and a huge sensation of space everywhere. You could eat from the floor as it's very clean. Great selection of food outlets and shops. Transiting is very easy as you would not need to clear security unless you travel from a non Schengen flight. Good public transportation options to downtown. Free Shuttle to Terminal . Definitely my preferred airport in Spain.,5,0
barcelona-airport,Nick Nasev,United Kingdom,Went through Terminal 1 a month ago and glad to report that the airport has staff waiting before you enter passport control for Section D to warn you that there is no going back to the rest of the airport and that there is only a McDonalds airside.,5,0
barcelona-airport,S Osborne,Australia,Beautiful modern clean light. Long Hangar style which results in easy navigation. However be careful with Gate D! We went through then couldn't visit the wonderful shops.,5,0
barcelona-airport,Albert Chan,Hong Kong,I had the same problem as many other travelers while departing. I was flying to Singapore and the boarding pass said Gate D. I found out that once you enter gate D you can't go to the shopping area one floor bellow and you are stuck on the floor with nothing but a McDonalds. But otherwise it is a good airport.,4,0
barcelona-airport,R Handelman,New Zealand,The new T1 is immaculate and clean. Plenty of shops in the Schengen area and no shortage of seats on this early morning flight. Security and Check-in was very quick as well.,5,0
barcelona-airport,F Bounajm,Canada,"If you're travelling outside the euro area make sure not to go through passport control area until you have purchased everything you're going to need for the trip. Otherwise you'll just end up watching all the shops from upstairs while having access to nothing other than a Mcdonald's and a duty free shop. We just wanted to buy a book or magazine for our 8-hour flight but no we couldn't do it because 95% of the shops weren't accessible. We tried to go back but they kep telling us it's ""impossible"". We tried to complain to info desk and security but they were completely unhelpful and dismissive.",1,0
barcelona-airport,A Williams,Spain,I reviewed Barcelona airport back in December 2009 and commented then that there was a stark difference between terminals 1 and 2 in terms of facilities and shops etc. Almost a year later and some things have changed but not so much as you may think. Terminal 1 remains the main terminal for major airlines and medium to long haul flights. While the overall facilities have not changed those flying from sections D and E of this terminal will thankfully notice that catering facilities are now available. These two sections were previously cordoned off from the remainder of the terminal and once in you cannot leave. Incredibly both sections offered nothing in the way if refreshments or shopping until very recently. It's in terminal T2 however where most has changed. In an attempt to fill this white elephant with passengers the airport has sought to attract several new airlines with extremely low fees. There is no better example than the recent arrival of Ryanair; a quick look at their fees would indicate that they are operating from the airport free of charge! The result then is that T2 is now teeming with activity. On passing through today almost all checkin desks were open and the place was almost full to capacity. Unfortunately however the decline in passenger numbers in 2009 has had a drastic effect on retail outlets operating from mthis terminal. Of the around 100 or so retail and catering outlets I would guess that 80 are now in a permanent state of closure. It is quite depressing passing through the hoards at security to be greeted by row after row of boarded up shops and cafeterias. With the exception of one or two specialist outlets a couple of coffee shops and one restaurant there is literally nothing else to occupy the time. Another unusual aspect is that arrivals and checkin at terminal T2A are also now closed; all entry and exit is now via T2B. Ultimately then while it's good to see the airport attempting to increase it's passenger numbers but maybe it's a case of too little too late. If you are flying through T1 you are still going to experience a pleasant enough journey T2 on the other hand remains soulless and boring.,4,0
barcelona-airport,Jonathan Beard,Canada,This is an outstanding airport. Clean efficient excellent toilets good climate control with a large variety of stops and eating places. Be prepared however for long walks to distant gates and somewhat confusing signage especially for first time arriving passengers.,5,0
barcelona-airport,Y Kahanovych,,I used the new T1 on arrival and departure for both Schengen and non-Schengen flights. My overall impression is great. The new terminal is airy bright functional and looks beautiful. There are lots of places to sit down and relax the air is always fresh and signage is simple and clear. I was also happy to find spacious check-in area with no queues at all. Bus connection to Catalunya works perfectly taxi ride was also simple with no hassle. Immigration took just seconds to pass through. This new terminal echoes Hong Kong architecturally and in terms of overall experience quality. The only minus was baggage delivery. It took 30 minutes. Not good.,5,0
barcelona-airport,R Mendoza,,Terminal 2 is undergoing renovation so many shops and restaurants closed. There are a few but they are limited. We found the security agents to be low class bordering on unprofessional (e.g. snickering not well-trained at all in handling international visitors). Passport control agents are dour like robots. What's the problem in giving a hint of humanity? The female passport control agent was more interested in reading her novel. We apparently disturbed her leisure. I suppose that was the reason for the dour/sour appearance to us. We flew Easyjet and it seems like BCN awarded the budget airlines the parking spaces at the most removed part of the terminal. The long walk to baggage reclaim took about 20 minutes at moderate speed. There should be an escalator walkway to help but there isn't. For the mobility impaired good luck. And toilets? None are apparent on this walkway. They are behind the shops or downstairs at baggage reclaim. I don't rate BCN high for these issues.,2,0
barcelona-airport,A Williams,,Barcelona airport has had quite a few makeovers in the last few years - the last being the opening of what is now terminal 1 a few months ago. Given the fact that navigating the roads leading toward the airport is difficult and unintuitive actually getting to terminal 1 is fairly easy however they now no longer allow you to drop off outside the terminal - you must park in the multi-storey (first few minutes are free). The new terminal is infinitely better that the old one - more spacious and easier to navigate and with much better eating and shopping options. However the prices are not attractive so unless you have some spare euros to get rid of then I would stick to window shopping. One bonus is the ability to shop when you arrive as well as when you depart - though when I came through a few weeks ago at around 10pm everything was closed. The old terminal (previously terminals A B and C) are now renamed Terminal 2 A B  and C an though it is large it is now all but deserted reserved almost exclusively for charter flights and budget airlines. Passing through there only this morning I noted that while Terminal 1 has around 20 flights an hour Terminal 2 has less than that a day! Of the 90 or so check-in desks we saw less than 5 open and it was clear that the shops and cafes are all running on minimum empty. Only a few weeks ago this place was still teaming with people. One good aspect of this is that parking is no longer an issue and queues are non existent. Unfortunately the biggest airline in terminal 2 - Easyjet - has relocated to terminal 2C which is itself a separate building a good 5 to 10 minute walk from terminal 2B. Our tickets still indicated terminal 2B so we joined several other passengers wandering aimlessly trying to find where Easyjet had moved to and of course with the reduction in passengers in this terminal there were no information points - or even any staff available. Terminal 2 C then was the busiest but has no facilities other than 4 vending machines and a cafe which is now closed. All in all the the distinct differences between the 2 terminals are very evident. If you are in terminal 1 you should have a nice smooth relaxing if expensive time. In terminal 2 however you may as well be in a ghost town - remember to bring your own coffee!,4,0
barcelona-airport,Rick Crowley,,On October 10th we had exactly the same problem. We saw that out tickets said go to D passport control which we did. Then we were stuck! Below us were all the shops and nice looking restaurants but on our level was a 3rd rate McDonalds and a tea shop that sold cold potato sandwiches. I went back to passport control and they would not let anyone back through. In the end there were about 10 of us all having two hours to waste and Euros to spend. The escalators only come up. One couple tried to run down it but were stopped. The lifts only go down if you have a security pass. Why is this is it because we were flying to London HR and we have such a bad reputation abroad? I hope not but why were we treated in such a bad way?,4,0
barcelona-airport,A Wolff,,I had the same problem as the last reviewer. If you depart from Gate D and E do not pass through passport control until boarding is about to commence. Instead follow signs to gates A B and C where you can enjoy the shops and eateries. Gates D and E trap you with only a McDonalds and a coffee shop and a surly teenager to serve you. We spent almost 2 hours in this cage looking at the lovely shops from the glass walls and sharing our grumbles with the other frustrated travellers. Absolutely ridiculous system and not something you'd expect from a major European airport.,1,0
barcelona-airport,Margaret Burford,,"Terminal 1 - after checking in we were given boarding passes for Gate D. We then proceeded through the security search and saw that gates A B and C were down the escalator and that gate D was to our left and gate E to the right. We could see passports were being checked at D so we proceeded forward. Wrong. Don't go through passport control until you are ready to board your plane. Once through the security check go straight down the escalator to the shops and restaurants. The big glass balcony that houses the security check area and Gates D and E give you the impression that once you have passed through passport control you can still proceed downstairs to the shops and restaurants - you can't. Once we realised our mistake I felt such a fool that I thought I would not be telling anyone until I realised that the balcony had loads of people wandering around wondering how they could now get down to the shopping area. Although the passport booth had a sign saying you cannot return back once having passed through this just conveyed the message to most people that you could not leave the airport. We did not realise it meant you would no longer have access to the shopping/restaurant area! Note to the Barcelona airport authorities: Please get the signage at the check in desks and through security to read ""Don't go through passport control until you are ready to board your plane."" You are losing revenue with all those people stuck up on the balcony with boarding passes for gates D and E!",3,0
barcelona-airport,Eddie Buckle,,I find Barcelona airport somewhat confusing. Coming in from Berlin we followed the sign from the gate for Schengen arrivals only to walk up to a locked door so it was back the other way to wave passports at somewhat bemused passport officers. Then you discover there are signs to three possible baggage delivery areas in Terminal 2 and have to peer at small screens to discover where yours will end up. Driving back to the airport we found ourselves going round in a circle after filling up the hire car - you get to a crossroads and have to guess and we guessed wrong. Once inside check-in was quick enough though there seem to be only very small departure screens to work out which desks you have to go to. Food is extortionate in the departure lounge.,3,0
barcelona-airport,J Mills,,The access to the airport is good but the signage from the motorway is terrible. The check out through arrivals is tortuous and the baggage and passport control very very slow. Coming back through to leave Spain the same problems with the motorway signs but the check in desk was quick. Don't bother with priority boarding as you all get on the same bus to the plane and its an absolute scramble for seats. The food in the departure lounge is extortionately priced and even a simple sandwich will cost you about £5. No simple food and we went hungry until we got back to the UK and bought some good old fish and chips. A burger at Barcelona Airport was £10. Half the shops were shut and the others so expensive we didn't use them.,1,0
bari-palese-airport,Pawel Litwinski,Poland,Arrival was perfect. Departure - a different story: chaotic queues people crowding everywhere. Was given wrong boarding passes (for my wife while my wife got hers) had to come back and queue again. Security did not find a 1.5 litre bottle of water in my carry on luggage. Just one bathroom in service for the whole departure hall.,1,0
bari-palese-airport,J Taverner,,Very pleasant modern local airport. good snack bar and drinks airside. 30 minute queue for check with BA to LGW spoilt it a bit. Many irate Italians wondering whether they would get home as Alitalia was on the verge of going bust.,4,0
bari-palese-airport,Ingvar Backéus,,We arrived recently to Bari in the middle of the night. Everything worked without problems until we came to the empty taxi stand. It was past 1am and we were about ten people waiting for taxi without knowing how to inform any taxi company about our existence. When one car finally arrived the driver refused to call the station but at least he gave us the number. After a long while we managed to leave the airport. Our departure was in the early morning. Check-in queues were long in spite of four open counters but I think this is a common phenomenon for early morning flights when most people tend to be late and arrive at the same time. Otherwise no problems. I know nothing about the shops because of the odd hours we were there.,,0
barnaul-airport,David Pryer,,The terminal is Soviet-style and a little big for just 2 or 3 flights a day to Moscow and the occasional charter. Check-in was slow with initially only one desk open but the service was friendly and efficient when eventually obtained. With a blizzard on the tarmac it was unsafe for the bus to drive out to the plane. Stumbling across the whipped up snow and ice is not something for the fainthearted. The early offer of an onboard drink was appreciated.,3,0
barra-eoligarry-airport,Matthew Ross,,"Tiny. But stunning location. Barra Aiport sits on the edge of a wide beach on the Scottish Island of Barra. Twice a day (once in winter) flights from Glasgow and Benbencula land on one of the three runways. But these are no ordinary tarmac runways. These are marked out on the sand of the beach - and only when the tide is out! The flights are the only British Airways flights where the timetable is marked ""subject to tide"". The terminal a proper little toy-town terminal complete with tiny terminal control tower big burly firemen and one check-in desk. No compromise though on safety checks and procedures. Be sure to be here in good time to watch the incoming Twin Otter fly in and land on the beach. The tiny cafe sells lovely home made organic snacks and the whole experiences is a joy if you have only been used to the hustle and bustle and chaos of some large well known international terminals. If a glorious sunny day check-in good and early and take time to stroll three hundred yards up over the dunes to see the other stunning beach close to this amazing little airport.",,0
basel-mulhouse-airport,F Monacense,Germany,"The worst airport I have seen in years. We arrived from Barcelona and wanted to continue our trip to Munich.

We were very surprised when we followed the ""Transfer"" signs that suddenly there was a security check. We tried to communicate in English and in German with the staff there and it turned out they spoke only French. BSL is a French airport. If you expect Swiss excellence then avoid this airport.",1,0

The best in the terminal is the Lounge its one of the best lounge worldwide and the architecture is great.,9,1
basel-mulhouse-airport,Mark Bates,United Kingdom,Most disappointing airport in Europe I have used. Despite it being quite busy there were only two lines for security so this took us an age to get through. However the biggest disappointment was the lack of facilities after security (we were in gates 22-32). After passport control on the part of the airport we were in there were no shops and just one very expensive place selling a small selection of food. At the very minimum I would expect a couple of shops including somewhere to but a drink at a soft drink at a reasonable price (there were vending machines and that was it)!,3,0
basel-mulhouse-airport,P Baer,Switzerland,Beware the surly Swissport employees who are not so nice and usually not so helpful. I travel to and from this airport frequently and have never had a nice encounter with a Swissport employee. Furthermore at times the security check for BSL can be incredibly long and slow. If there is a line be prepared to wait up to 30 minutes. For such a small airport it seems counter intuitive to have such long queues for security.,5,1
basel-mulhouse-airport,P Smith,Switzerland,Using Basel airport with British Airways. The airport is situated in France and run by French staff most of which are impolite or not bothered to say the least do not speak any foreign language (i.e. German or English - bearing in mind that they work on the Swiss side of the airport and should at least have some rudimentary understanding that they may have to converse in German at Basel or the lingua franca which is English and not French) and have a 'cannot do' attitude to customers. The security staff simply do not understand that BA's Club Europe is Business Class and try to refuse entry to fast track. This is even more surprising given that only Turkish Airlines Swiss Lufthansa Air France and BA operate from and to Basel as proper international airlines and surely it cannot be that hard to learn their business class products. This has been happening for the last three - four months now. The airport facilities are extremely poor. The duty free shopping offers prices anyone can get on the high street and the food & beverage facilities are not clean extremely expensive for what they offer and offer very limited choice. The public toilets are dirty beyond belief.,2,0
basel-mulhouse-airport,Kurt Zingg,Australia,Basel is a compact airport where you don't get lost or have to walk for miles to the departure gate. Luggage is delivered quickly. Hire cars are available close to the terminal. The trip to Basel city can take as little as 15 minutes by taxi or a bit longer by public bus.,9,1
basel-mulhouse-airport,Mark Barber,United Kingdom,Small compact airport run in a lazy manner. At busy times its not unusual to wait 45 minutes or more to check-in at the Swiss desks due to limited staff. There is almost no use of jet ways (despite there being plenty on the apron) and anyone with walking difficulties will be frustrated by the poor gate design which fails to consider access (lots of stairs) and the attitude of indifferent staff who meet requests for assistance with shrugged shoulders. There is an extremely limited choice of duty free shops and cafe's in the airport. Getting to and from the airport is via the number 50 bus which runs at regular intervals to the city or by taxi which are among the most expensive in the world - more than double the rates of London cabs.,2,0
basel-mulhouse-airport,Paul Van Alsten,,Basel-Mulhouse is a pleasant and convenient airport. Luggage delivery usually quick. Baggage claim area has two distinct exits - to France and to Switzerland. On the Swiss side very helpful and friendly public transportation desk. Bus line 50 connects the airport to Basel central station every 10 mins - reliable service at CHF5.80 one-way travel time around 20 mins. On the French side more limited service - no direct connection to Mulhouse: a shuttle bus brings you first to Saint-Louis railway station from there you can catch a regional train to Mulhouse. Upon departure check-in at the self-service machines hassle-free. No queue at security but staff prefers speaking French than English. In the public area large terrace with nice views on the apron. The restaurant on the Swiss side is truly delicious with decent prices; but I would rather avoid the bistro on the French side - gloomy with only basic food. Boarding gates are lacking proper airconditioning so that it can quickly become very warm there. French domestic flights are cheaper when entering MLH Mulhouse as destination - on the opposite international flights are cheaper with BSL Basel as destination.,4,0
basel-mulhouse-airport,Gyorgy Szeibert,,Looks/feels like an oversized airport & if you're in hurry not so fine to see advertisement or something like that on the flight info screens.

Well worth.,4,0
basel-mulhouse-airport,David Griffiths,,Excellent airport although it seems rather under-utilised (or unnecessarily big if you prefer). Arrival with LH was easy and pleasant with quick baggage and laid-back passport control. Departing a few days later with BA was the same although I wouldn't fancy going through security if the airport was very busy - few channels and slightly officious French staff with little or no English.

On arrival from Liverpool we were off the plane within one or two minutes of the plane coming to a halt. Similar efficiency on the way back. Very quiet today (a Sunday) with many of the shops and catering facilities shut.

Duty Free shops are plentiful and well stocked!,,0
basel-mulhouse-airport,P Travis,,"For it's small size a difficult airport to navigate due to the EU / non-EU (Swiss) division. Arrived and exited through French side for Germany bus; no Forex counter so had to re-enter Baggage Claim ""unofficially"" to get Forex since the only Forex counter upon arrival is in Baggage Claim. Exiting baggage claim caused a problem since the ""computer"" showed my passport as having been scanned a few minutes back. Upon departure entered on French side (came from Germany) had to exit France and enter Switzerland because British Airways check-in counter is *only* on the Swiss side. After check-in had to exit Switzerland and enter France since BA gate is on the French side. And yes my US passport is scrutizined and scanned for each of these exits and entries. In the gate area upstairs there is an interesting collection of ""beach sands of the world"". About fifty or so each specimen is on a saucer the whole thing looks like someone's private hobby. Fun nonetheless. P.S. There is no ""smoking area"" by the French gates but there is one by the Swiss gates; however you cannot cross to the Swiss side from the gate area.",,0
basel-mulhouse-airport,Alexander Eichener,,A little almost tiny airport bordering on cosy yet quite modern and unassuming. Access via bus and individual car parking are both very convenient.

basel-mulhouse-airport,Matthew Eden,,It is a sad fact of modern economics that after having spent a fortune upgrading the capacity and facilities of BSL (Euroairport) that Swiss has decided to leave the airport from the end of March 2004 leaving many slots to the UK and within Europe unused and with no obvious competitor waiting in the wings to pass them on. There are very few scheduled airlines using the airport and it seems that the main users will be holiday charters and freight. What a pity - if only one could bring back Crossair (or a new 'post-Swiss takeover' reincarnation) which was an airline with honest fares a reliable fleet run by efficient and caring crew and well- used and appreciated by the flying public.,,0

beauvais-airport,J O'Neill,Ireland,I have flown with Ryanair into BVA twice now from DUB and SNN. The airport is not great.

beauvais-airport,C Kenny,Ireland,"Be warned when getting the shuttle from Beauvais to Paris. Firstly it is a full five or six minute walk from exit door of new terminal building to the bus point (not just outside door). Secondly despite some websites saying buses leave 20 minutes after each flight arrives it was about 50 minutes after my flight with no busses leaving at two departure times shown on the display board during that period. This meant that I missed a train connection in Paris by two minutes. Also one should always assume that the bus will take up to 90 minutes to get to Porte Maillot from the time it actually starts to drive at Beauvais. On a good day it might do it in 60 minutes. Then at Porte Maillot allow full 15 minutes to get suitcase out of bus compartment (no facility for airline ""carry on"" inside bus) plus walk to Metro buying metro ticket and finding platform for metro train.",3,0
beauvais-airport,B Currie,United Kingdom,I am fairly well travelled but I can say with confidence that this is the worst airport I have ever been to. I was on time for my flight and queued with the rest to get my boarding card scanned before proceeding through to security. There was only one staff member scanning so the queue moved very slowly. Considering there were 4 flights leaving within an hour of each other one would have expected more staff given the volume of passengers. I was concerned that it was getting closer and closer to the time for the gates to close but at no point was my flight called to the front nor was there a warning on the TV screen so I continued to wait patiently. When I finally got to the front of the queue at 10.02 (the gates officially closed at 10.00 and flight was due to leave at 10.30) I was refused entry. I tried to explain that I had been waiting but was ignored. Knowing how small this airport is and the fact that all the gates are in the same area it would have taken me only a couple of minutes to walk through and make my way onto the plane with my hand luggage but absolutely no regard was given to my situation and not a single staff member even attempted to try and assist me. After speaking to my friend who lived in France for some time she told me that the same thing happened when she took a flight late last year. 10 or so passengers missed their flight the same way that I did so clearly there are real issues with how they manage things at Beauvais. I have used Ryanair and this airport many times but after that experience I vow never to again. Worst customer service I have ever experienced.,,0
beauvais-airport,L Ryan,France,Incredibly it's getting worse. Our flight lost its take-off slot because of insufficient security personnel. After a decade still no bus link to Rouen Dieppe or Amiens. Seething queues milling in all directions including passengers for Poland lost in the wrong terminal. Even the staff admit to being ashamed of the whole hideous mess. This airport has now been used by Ryanair for a quarter of a century - how long does it take to get it up to par? Why doesn't Ryanair move to Rouen-Boos airport which is just as near to Paris (ie an hour) and currently empty?,1,0
beauvais-airport,D Barrett,Portugal,I use this airport (Terminal 2) on a monthly basis because of the cost of flying. The shuttle service from Paris is good but allow extra time during peak season. Seating in the departure lounge is very limited so I tend to delay my entry there to the minimum. If you have children then you have a problem as there is nothing here for them worse still if your flight is delayed. I've not really had a problem here as I travel solo but this weekend gone I was refused a beer at the bar inside the departures area as I did not want food this is a first for me not just at this airport but anywhere in the world. I obviously was not aware of this before going through. I agree with previous comments on here that it is expensive to buy food snacks and drinks also consider the seating area at the bar/restaurant is cramped.,5,0
beauvais-airport,J O'Brien,Ireland,I would have to agree with D Parent 's comments on this airport. I have travelled Ryanair a lot but I have never set foot in what must be the worst airport they fly into. We fly out of Terminal 1. The airport is well sign posted from the road. We took the bus and it dropped us beside it. The check-in area was basic but efficient. My tip to anyone is do not go though security until about an hour before your flight is due to leave as once you get though security there is nothing there. Only enough seats for around 50 people in the departure lounge. We stupidly thought that maybe there would be better food in the departure lounge. All there is is a small Illy cafe which cost us 12 euros for 2 bags of crisps and 2 cokes. I know airport prices are bad but that took the biscuit. The departure lounge is so small and there was around 600 people there with only seats for 50 of them. One other poster said this airport reminded him of a barn I'd agree with that. If you can use Orly or De Gaule. The toilets were filthy too my wife refused to use them when she saw them.,2,0
beauvais-airport,D Parent,Canada,One of the worst airport I have been to. Too small for the amount of travellers landing there via cheap airline companies. Queuing for the doors to open to go into the passport area queuing for passport queuing for the bus to Paris and then on the return trip queuing for check-in queuing for security queuing for passport. I am not talking small amount of queuing! But I guess these are the type of things to expect when you travel cheap.,2,0
beauvais-airport,Mark Wadham,France,Since my last review the security queues have not improved - if anything they are worse. I stood in line for 1 hour! Consequently I did not have time to visit the airport shops so the airport is in fact losing money by not increasing security facilities. On the bright side there are now private car park operators off-site which brings welcome competition.,2,0
beauvais-airport,David Nassau,United States,This airport is pretty far from Paris (one hour by bus) so give yourself plenty of time. There is a dedicated bus service which is nice. The computer ticket machine would not accept my debit card since it is an American card not European so I had to wait until the teller showed up to buy a ticket with cash. Besides that bus service was fine. When I got to the airport I had to wait for the screen to tell which counter to go to for my flight then wait for an airline representative to show up. The line for passport control/security was quite long so I was nervous about missing my flight. Once I got through the terminal was quite small and the gate was right there. All in all a perfectly reasonable experience.,7,1
beauvais-airport,N Gagnebin,France,BVA-TSR. The shuttle bus in Paris are something organised but when I arrived there I had to queue and so many people were waiting there that I feared not being able to get in. At 10 AM no bus were at the starting point but at 10.15 AM 13 buses had arrived. In Beauvais low cost companies have this tiny box where you have to put your luggage to be able to get in the plane. There are people who check and ask every passenger to fit their hand luggage in the box and if it doesn't send you back to the company. The security people are nice and welcoming it's just a pain to queue for 100 meters going along bags' check identity check and security check. The airport is small but with the new terminal there are more space and room for passengers waiting in the departure gate.,3,0
beauvais-airport,Paul Cam,Ireland,"Dublin from Beauvais airport 4 yrs after my last experience but that was a nightmare I will not use this airport again and will continue flying from CDG with either Aer Lingus or Air France. Staff are not polite and not welcoming. Check in started 10 mins late no information given when staff arrived they didn't apologise no ""hello"" or smile they don't even look at you when talking to you. Once check in is finished you have to queue for passport check's (they check your passport 4 times in 10 meters). Waiting area is awful along with boarding the plane. They are making people queue for ages whereas staff on plane where waiving at the 2 airport staff (that are suppose to allow people board the plane but where to busy talking to each other). There were 2 accesses to the plane (at the front and at the back) one plane hostess was shouting for 10 mins to let the people board at back of plane as the front of the plane was too busy. I have flown from so many airports in the world and many French airports but I couldn't believe what I was experiencing. So many passengers also where shocked with the level of incompetence from staff. So folks just be prepared when flying from Beauvais and it is really not worth any longer.",1,0
beauvais-airport,G Watts,Ireland,Terrible - will not use this airport ever again no matter how cheap the flight! Our flight was at 3pm and we were at the airport before 1.15pm but nearly missed it. They do not seem to be able to cope and why do they have to check your passport 4 times before you even get on the plane. No queues just people herded together for 1 man to take 5 minutes to look at each passport with no regard to the mounting mass of people or that flights were waiting to take off. Chaos and stressed out passengers. It was a relief to get home and this is not what you need after a lovely holiday in Paris. Be warned too because the shuttle buses only operate at set times. We got to the collection point for 12 noon to be told that there would not be another bus until 1.15pm which would mean we and a load of other passengers who arrived at the same time and after us would not make it for our flights. Had to share a taxi to the airport with other passengers and it cost every passenger EU35 and no refund if you had bought a return ticket for the shuttle. You are not told this when you buy the return ticket and you miss the signs when you arrive as you head across the car park to get the metro or train to your destination. A lot of unhappy people so don't get caught out with the shuttle bus.,1,0
beauvais-airport,Liz Ryan,France,There is now a second terminal which has eased the overcrowding. It's a very short walk from the long-term car park which is great - except that the cost of parking for my next trip is treble the air fare. Still no bus to Beauvais from Rouen hardly surprising since I've only been lobbying for one for nine years. You know how things move in France - Rouen tourism office says 'we have enough tourists we don't need a bus to Beauvais' (an hour away!) The cost of Beauvais parking is now driving me back to flying Aer Lingus from CDG when possible which is more cheaply accessible by train + bus.,3,0
beauvais-airport,K Setton,United States,The wait area for check in seemed more like a cafeteria with dirty iron chairs than an airport. Maybe I'm spoiled because I'm used to airports having wifi decent and enough places to sit and a heating system? It was freezing. When we could finally check in and proceed to security people were so crowded together into the unorganized mob inching toward the boarding pass checker I could feel breath on my head. It took 40 minutes to get through security - only 3 lanes were open to accommodate the herd of cattle pushing and standing uncomfortably close to each other. The other side of security was not much better with no place to plug in a laptop and only one cafe and a duty free store. Flight was delayed an hour and a half. No tunnels to get into the plane so we were freezing waiting in the line. Hugely uncomfortable. Return trip to Beauvais was more bearable because we were just passing through but my luggage came onto the conveyor belt soaked through from the rain.,2,0
beauvais-airport,Liz Ryan,,Used to be a great airport - even had the free parking that makes so many French airports a joy - but now Beauvais is a victim of its own success. Chaotically overcrowded expensive confrontational and stressful. The staff do their best but the overcrowding simply frazzles everyone. Parking often costs more than airfare. There's still no bus to Rouen Dieppe or anywhere bar Paris. Seating is inadequate and even with the new extension + pre-printed boarding cards the check-in queues are a nightmare. Rows with Ryanair over baggage are never- ending and it's not uncommon to see passengers in tears. I've started to use CDG in preference - getting there is cheaper than parking at Beauvais for any trip of more than a few days' duration and Aer Lingus is a far more restful option than Ryanair. Sad to say all this - used to love using this airport but now dread it. Wonder if management cares about passenger comments?,2,0
beauvais-airport,D Jones,,Beauvais was utter chaos when I travelled from there to Dublin. We arrived 2 and a half hours before departure and still almost missed the flight. Security were so slow it seemed like it was intentional. Why do the bag checkers need to look at everyone's passport when its already been checked by immigration. Loads of people missed the flight. Chaos.,1,0
beauvais-airport,John O Meara,,From Beauvais Airport you can take one of the shuttle buses to Paris. The journey takes between 45 minutes and an hour depending on traffic. If you arrive on a busy day make sure you have your ticket bought before you land or you might have to wait for a later bus. To get to Disney it can take up to 3 hours!Take an airport transfer service.,4,0
beauvais-airport,Mark Wadham,,This once great little airport has outgrown itself. When there were just 2 or 3 flights a day this airport was a pleasure to use. The problem is that there are now many flights and further expansion is planned. This would be fine if the facilities were developed in parallel. I arrived one hour before my flight having checked-in online to find the car parks at near saturation point. A helpful attendant invited me to leave my car at the end of a row but outside a normal parking space. In the terminal there was a very long queue to go through passport control & security. This was because insufficient staff were on duty for the number of passengers. This is inexcusable as surely the authorities must know the number of passengers expected beforehand. it also represents a loss for the airport as many passengers - myself included no longer had time to visit the shops. Although at the airport one hour before the flight I only boarded 10 minutes before departure due to these inadequacies. The other major problem at this airport is access. If your destination/departure point is Paris there's no problem. If it's anywhere else there is virtually no other choice than to use a car and be subjected to the monopolistic practices of using the airport car parks. There is a bus to Beauvais but its infrequency is as good as to render it useless. This airport needs to invest fast in additional parking quicker security and larger departure lounges. The bus service to Beauvais needs to be increased to at least one bus per hour to allow the surrounding communities to benefit from what is after all Beauvais airport rather than Paris airport.,2,0
beauvais-airport,Beverley Davidson,,We travelled to Paris from Dublin I use a wheelchair and this was my first time to travel in a plane as you can imagine I was very apprehensive on how I would manage. I have only commendation for the staff at Beauvais Airport and for the staff on the airport bus they were fantastic from the moment we came of the plane they were there to help my husband and I and when we got to the bus the guys there were just as helpful I would say from them all I got 5 star treatment. The bus was great the driver and staff made sure that I was able to get on the bus and that I was comfortable on both journeys to and from the airport. I would have no hesitation in flying to Beauvais Airport or using the airport bus.,5,0
beauvais-airport,Joe Bailey,,Do not go there when there are more than 5 flights going out in any one hour as there are only 4 gates. Departure Hall is a health and safety case. The volumes of passengers and the airport at peak times are incompatible with even the most basic service levels or safety. Surely these places have to undergo some basic inspections and approval. As for the bus to and from Port Maillot. They take only a little longer than some of the transfers to Orly or CDG though frequency can be an issue. They work fine but are best booked on line. Here's the rub if you save on the Ryaniar flight consider the cost together with the bus fare you may find flying with another carrier to Orly and CDG cheaper all told!,1,0
beauvais-airport,N Hughes,,A mixed experience. Fog meant that we didn't use BVA inbound the flight was diverted to Lille. On our return we utilised the connecting bus service which worked well though there was an argument about our tickets which we hadn't used when we arrived due to the diversion. Best idea is to purchase them at the time - you don't save anything by buying them online and could be lumbered with them if your plans have to change. Our flight departed at 22:50. Unfortunately four other flights were also departing at round about the same time and Beauvais struggled to cope. The space available airside is limited and staff struggled to inject some order into those passing through security and passport control. The other side was just a seething mass of humanity with people sat on the floor or milling about waiting for their flight to be called. There was a duty free shop and a cafe but these could not provide respite from the hundreds of passengers awaiting departure. If you are lucky enough to be there at a less busy time I am sure that Beauvais will be a perfectly good little airport but it certainly could do with some sort of expansion to cope with increasing demand.,2,0
beauvais-airport,Cairns Stanners,,We found the airport excellent both when we arrived and departed. Staff were helpful and there were no delays. Do not use Paris Shuttle Services as we had a terrible experience. We waited an hour for our shuttle then managed to get someone in their office to be told he didn't know what had happened to our shuttle but would get another one of their drivers to speak to us at the airport. Eventually he found us to be told that our driver had forgotten us and that he would give us our money back then we would have to catch a bus going to Paris. With the hours wait then on the bus to bus park walk to the metro which was 1 mile away then change twice to get to our hotel. It took us 3 hours to get to our hotel after landing at Beauvais. On our return journey we waited just over an hour for the shuttle and were told by the hotel that as the shuttle company are obviously unreliable we will book you a taxi so that you will catch your flight. Just as we were waiting on a taxi the shuttle arrived at the hotel entrance. We cancelled the taxi as we had paid up front for the shuttle. The driver never even apologised and got us to airport 1 hour before the flight but it was a hair raising experience as he broke the speed limit most of the journey. So I would advise people not to book up and pay in advance for a shuttle.,4,0
beauvais-airport,M Miles,,Airport was wonderful - comfortable and easy access to your luggage after disembarking. BUT do not use ATA Beauvais shuttle service - it is uncomfortable unsafe and took much longer than just using the Ryanair bus. Simply the best transport out of the airport is to take the bus - the other options are either very expensive (private taxi) or a waste of time/money.,4,0
beauvais-airport,Colin McLean,,Be wary when paying up front for advertised pre-booked shuttle service such as parisshuttleservice.com. If they fail to appear then you are left with an expensive option of a private taxi plus the problem of getting your money back.,3,0
beauvais-airport,Georg Zechner,,Arrived at Beauvais from Rome - great experience luggage was there in a matter of 10 minutes and we boarded the bus to Paris within 15 minutes of debarking the aircraft- great. On the flight back check-in was fast (we arrived 90 minutes early and they had 2 lines open). Security was also fast. But then came a nightmare- they have 4 gates and there are no screens that tell you where your flight will be. They are all very close together so that in our cast there were about 400 people wondering where they have to line up. Shortly before boarding they tell you where to go but you are squeezed in all the time- very unpleasant and stupid because they could change that easily. Also the bard at the gates take advantage of the new security measures and sell a 05 l bottle of water at 3€. More than next to the Eiffel tower! ALL employees we met were very friendly though.,3,0
beauvais-airport,Morag McLean,,There is now a ticket office in the bus park (can't quite call it a bus station yet) at Porte Maillot. You must buy your tickets there - they don't sell them on the bus anymore. So if you have to buy a ticket to Beauvais I'd recommend getting to Porte Maillot 15 minutes earlier. There is a good map of the Porte Maillot area and directions of how to get to the Metro station at www.hotelsreviewed.com/paris-porte-maillot- bus-metro.html,1,0
beauvais-airport,G McDonagh,,"As a family we have used Beauvais a number ot times during the past few years and have seen the changes that this airport has had over this time frame. When we used it first I thought that it was a great airport with the fact that the plane comes right up to the door and the luggage was there as soon as you arrived at the pickup point and you were away within 20 mins of arriving. The departure check in was also a dream and you could live with the ""tent"". Having just arrived back from our most recent trip I have now changed my mind. The airport is now a lot busier with more flights arriving and departing and quite frankly it is not geared up to handle the situation it finds itself in. The problem starts as soon as you arrive. The arrival area is quite small and the luggage conveyor is also quite small. Flights are nearly full and 100-150 people trying to get in to get their bags makes it quite tight. The conveyor soon fills up and with the short distance of travel before bags start to come around again leads to a lot of stopping and starting of the belt. On this occasion it did not effect us as we were in no hurry out of the airport as we were were staying in a local hotel (which was prebooked) for the night before heading on in the morning. The car hire pick up point is fine and we had no problems. This is the third or fourth time that we have picked up a hire car and have never had any problem. One point could be that all the car hire offices with the exception of Hertz close before the last flights arrive so you are limited to which company you can use if you arrive late. The departure hall is also very small with no information as to which check in gate that your flight will be at apart from the screens that are behind each desk which do not display any info until the flight is actually checking in. With the lines of passengers checking in for other flights this leads to mad scrambles from where you may have managed to find a seat (Which are not exactually in plentiful supply for the amount of people) to where your flight eventually checks in. The problem is the depth of the actual hall. The distance from the desk to the window means that the queue tends to turn down along the hall where it gets caugh up with the queue from the desk beside it. After you have checked in you need join the queue to go through the security check. This you may feel is the same at every airport and is quite necessary and I do not have a problem with the check in itself. The problem is that at Beauvais there are not enough machines for the volumn of people passing through and also the area in which these checks are carried out is also quite small which leads to the large queue forming behind this. Having got through this you arrive in to the ""new departure gates"". This area still has no information regarding the particular gate that you will eventually board your plane until it actually opens for boarding. People start to queue where the think the flight will board only to find that they are at the wrong gate and another mad rust starts to get to the correct gate . Seeing as the gates are so close and when pass through the gate you walk to the plane how difficult would it be to put the information up at the gate before the flight arrives so people as least have a chance of being in the right area. If you are traveling with Ryanair book the priority boarding option. It cuts out any messing around as you do not have to join the mad scramble to try to get near the front of the queue for getting on the plane. Ok if you are traveling alone but with children you want to get seats together. Familys with children no longer get priority when boarding the flights so you could end up being split up if you are unluckly to be further down the queue for boarding. The facilities in this ""new area"" leave a lot to be desired. The gents toilet was in need of a good clean to the point that I would be reluctant to let the children use it. The cost at the ""cafe"" inside the departure area is a complete rip off and now that you cannot bring any thing through the security gate you are at their mercy. €3:90 for a small bottle of coke and not much cheaper for a ""large coffee"" which is in fact a slightly bigger then normal paper cut which is not even full. ( I would hate to see a small cup). Pretty negative feed back you may feel. In saying all above I would still use Beauvais again as it is a means to an end and the flights are quite cheap compared to other carriers but be prepared for what you get when you arrive.",,0
beauvais-airport,Alan McLaughlin,,I make the trip to Beauvais and Prestwick most weekends and I have never had a problem with the facilities. The airport authority are clearly investing in and upgrading the buildings with the income from increased flights and staff are always courteous and efficient and board the flights by sequence number. The airport is a bit far out like all Ryanair destinations but just try getting to CDG at peak times and you will soon appreciate the drive through the French countryside from Beauvais. For car rentals returns I suggest going into Beauvais centre to fill up your tank as all the petrol stations around the airport close by 7:00pm and the machines only seem to accept French Visa cards. Instead of turning right at the airport road traffic lights turn left past McDonalds and follow the signs for Beauvais centre / Cathedral - which is a straight road. Just at the town centre traffic lights turn right and you will see a Total petrol station open until 10:00pm.,,0
beauvais-airport,Anne Simpson,,We were a family of two adults and two kids travelling from Prestwick to Disneyland Paris. As Beauvais airport is about 117kms from Disneyland and relatively expensive for four to get there and back we decided the cheapest way was to hire a car and print out a route planner from the A.A. to make our destination easier to find. Getting there was not a problem and took just over an hour but coming back on the Sunday evening heading in the direction of Paris was a different story. The traffic was heavier and we got lost a few times which might not have happened had we taken a decent map with us. The car was due back at the Hertz Rental by 7pm and as we were running a bit late we decided to wait till we got to Beauvais before topping up the fuel. There was a gas station 2kms from the airport but unfortunately it was closed . As we didn't have the time to start looking about for another we took the car back and was charged 57euros for the half tank of diesel we used. Make sure you top up en route when you find a station otherwise it could end up being a very costly car hire. Otherwise Hertz were very reasonable at £73 for the 3 days hire and we were given a brand new Peugeot which let us get about and discover some good designer outlets very close to the Parks and a big shopping centre at the junction of the A104 9kms from Disneyland. It had a big Carrefour supermarket. We were able to purchase fruit salad cold meat and rolls to do us while in the Parks as what they offer in the Parks is total junk food and very costly. The other good thing with hiring a car is you can then choose a cheaper hotel to stay at a bit further away from the parks and if you have the yearly pass for the parks you can park at the parks for free otherwise it is 8 euros each day you park there. It would probably work out even cheaper to take our own car and drive all the way there but we were limited for time and we did get exceptionally cheap tickets with Ryan Air having booked well in advance. I hope this information will be useful to future travellers with kids and on a limited budget.,,0
beauvais-airport,Grant Russell,,I've flown into Beauvais twice now from Prestwick and encountered no problems. The departure 'lounge' is a tent but the rest of the airport looks up to scratch and is more than sufficient for what you pay for. As said before bus services to Paris are very punctual and although it can take up to 90 minutes to get into town depending on the time of day it is still a good service. The bus then drops off at Porte Maillot next to the Palais which has access to Metro Line 1 in its basement or you can access the metro just across the road. All the main 'city centre' areas of Paris are located on this line such as Champs Elysees Arc de Triomphe Louvré Concorde and Gare de Lyon train station. A good few of the stops on this line also connect to the areas where most of the cheaper hotels are located so it's a simple process as long as you're not trying to navigate the metro with all your luggage during a busy time.,,0
beauvais-airport,Gilbert Jones,,Bus connection to Paris is very efficient. This airport has very few shops. The shops that are here are very expensive but in general everywhere in Paris is expensive. The duty free shop here is very expensive and you will save very little buying here if you are flying between EU countries. Would not recommend Paris for a weekend break. The people in Paris are very boring and have no sense of humour. They need to learn how to smile but I suppose that is very difficult with the cost of living here. Coming from Ireland I am glad to be home.,,0
beauvais-airport,Susan Henshaw,,Took a four day break in Paris . We found service at Beauvais airport brilliant the staff were so good.

beauvais-airport,Chris Maverley,,I'm just back from a week break in Paris. I found BVA airport amusing but considering the cost of the flight the efficiency of the airport and friendliness of the staff everything worked out well. Our bus to Paris departed not long after we landed and collecting baggage was a breeze. I travelled from CDG before and found it more stressful than the BVA route. I enjoyed seeing the countryside during the trip to Paris on the bus and I thought the bus itself was good. I think some people are expecting too much for the price they have paid. I agree about the prices of the snack bar and I will be sure not to be hungry next time I am there and I will travel this route again. On arriving at Porte Maillot Metro 1 is across the road and from there it's plain sailing. Be careful about booking early flights home as you have to get the bus 3 hours before your flight departure time in some cases it can mean getting up at 4am and Ryan Air charge a hefty fee for changing flights.,,0
beijing-capital-airport,Jason Martin,United States,"Recently arrived and departed through Beijing Capital Airport Terminal 3, and it was not a good experience. To point out the only positive, I am sure everyone agrees the architecture and terminal structure is very modern and nice. Other than that there are no positives. I arrived from Hong Kong and waited over an hour in the immigration line. There were only three passport control agents for hundreds of passengers. While waiting in line there were Chinese Security guards yelling at passengers in Chinese, leaving Non-Chinese speaking passengers very confused. After you clear immigration you take a train to the main terminal. Going through baggage claim was a hassle and customs checks everyone's bags. I waited over 45 minutes in a taxi line. Then the fun started. On departures, do not use a mobile boarding pass. You have to scan your boarding pass in order to go on the the train. Then you arrive at the satellite terminal and wait in a long line to go through passport control. After they check your boarding pass and passport, you have to wait in another long line for another official to check your boarding pass and passport and to go through security. The space is really small and people were pushing. I was flying Business Class and had to beg the Security Official to let me use the fast track lane, while people were cutting it with no explanation. Once they check your boarding pass and passport again, they make you take out iPads. I went to the Air China Business Class Lounge, and needed to use Wifi (which you would expect they would have at the lounge) - they have a machine where you have to scan your passport and it gives you a number. The WiFi didn't even work, so it was a waste of time. IF you are going to the US they search for liquids right by the boarding gate and will take away your water (will make you depend on the rations by the flight attendants), even through they had several checkpoints before hand. All in all, this is a very disorganized and a passenger unfriendly airport. I will not be traveling back to Beijing anytime soon because going throughout this airport was extremely stressful.",1,0
beijing-capital-airport,L Chen,China,"Security lines are a mess, worst I've experienced of any significant hub worldwide.

beijing-capital-airport,Johnson Beary,Canada,"The worst airport! If you arrive at Terminal 2, it will be extremely hard to transfer to terminal 3. Unnecessary security checks again and again.

beijing-capital-airport,P Niskanen,United States,A handsome airport spoiled by poor immigration and security procedures. We arrived late from Hong Kong en route to San Francisco. Once we found the transfer point for international flights there was quite a line. There were only two officials to process the passports for 30-50 people waiting in line. About 30 minutes. Next came security with another 40-60 minute wait in line and somewhere in the process there was a second line for checking passports. There was no provision for those with short connections. Had we not been in business class (with its own security area) we would not have made a connection with a 1 hour and 40 minute transfer. The airport is handsome and offers good facilities but the understaffed immigration and security procedures make we want to avoid a return trip through Beijing.,4,0
beijing-capital-airport,C Zhu,United States,International transfer at T3 terminal in 4 April 2015: Positive impression: New spacious (once inside terminal past security check) good shopping and eating choices. Negative impression - mainly about security check: (1) the space reserved for security check queuing is simply too small for handling large amounts of passenger traffic thus creating chaos and confusion and long waiting time (2) do not understand why passengers with rolling carry- on luggage must be sorted and asked to take a separate line seemly adding more chaos (3) security personnel directing traffic only give orders in Chinese leaving non-Chinese passengers confused (4) many security personnel are impolite non-smiling and at times rude. Suggestions for improvement: First and foremost please increase (at least double) the space for security check queuing; Security personnel should be more helpful polite and warm.,5,0
beijing-capital-airport,H Vuong,Vietnam,"Terminal 3. Transfer at PEK is time-consuming. It took me forever to queue and go through security. However it is not a big point. I purchased bottles of water after all the security checks and then was not allowed to take those bottles on board. Why? Bottles of water sealed or unsealed were asked to left behind. Yet later I saw some people with their ""unsealed"" (already opened and half full) bottles with them on the plane. Security checks at gate is a joke Beijing International Airport! I departed LAX SFO TPE and bought water bottles airside and were allowed to take them on board.",5,1
beijing-capital-airport,Robert Walbeek,China,Do they know in Beijing what Priority luggage means? Obviously not. On the many occasions I arrive in Beijing my bag is always last on the belt. So who is to blame the airline or the airport. Complaining does not help.,3,1
beijing-capital-airport,J Gold,United States,A caution to Air China passengers travelling to the USA (and potentially other international destinations) that security staff in the boarding area will confiscate any liquids even though you will by then have been through 2 prior security checks. So after you drop US$6 on a bottle of Evian (since there are no other options) you will have it taken away from you. Worse the security staff blames the TSA who (falsely) insist that they are forced to do this. Bring good running shoes if you are transiting from domestic to international! If the positive reviews note that PEK is superior to most US airports that is a pretty low bar!,2,0
beijing-capital-airport,J Wright,United Kingdom,Transited through T3 on Air China from LHR to BKK. Modern and clean with good facilities and retail. Friendly staff. Most restaurants bars and cafes open 06.00 to 24.00 with a few including Duty Free shops open 24 hrs. All accept Visa or Mastercard even the local ones so there's no need for cash. Outbound arrived transfered and departed all within T3-E but warning: there is no smoking room in T3-E so on return I got the free 72 hr transit visa and headed to T3-C via the monorail. This was easy and probably didn't take any longer than just going through security in T3-E as the queues were much shorter. T3-C is the main check-in area with more choice of restaurants and retail and where you can go outside to smoke! I then just returned through security and caught the monorail back to T3-E for departure. T3-E was quite cold though as it was December so make sure you have some warm clothes!,8,1
beijing-capital-airport,Jordan Ng,Singapore,I transited at this airport and my onward flight was the last flight departing Beijing at 00.10 with Air China to Singapore. The next departing flight was hours later. There were hardly any shops in operation except F&B outlets such as Pizza Hut. Since it is the last flight queues for security checks were short. Toilets were located quite far and I have to walk quite a distance. There is Wi-Fi service but to connect to it I need to go to the customer service counter to collect a slip containing a code to use the Wi-Fi service - very troublesome as I hardly have to do this at other major airports.,6,1
beijing-capital-airport,J Liu,United States,If you fly a Skyteam airline through PEK you are out of luck in that you won't get to experience Beijing's world- class Terminal 3. Instead you must transit through dusty tired old Terminal 2 with very limited food and shopping choices. Lounge areas for premium passengers are equally drab with old furniture and lacklustre food. The good part is that T2 is uncrowded most of the time since most all other airlines except Skyteam have moved to T3. Hence there are almost no lines for check-in security and customs and baggage claim is speedy. Departing international flights out of T2 will often get to enjoy a virtually deserted concourse with the fellow passengers on your flight the only others in the building.,5,0
beijing-capital-airport,B Olson,Canada,I thought Beijing airport was excellent. I speak very little Mandarin but had no problem arriving and departing the airport. Everything is in English. Had some questions and they were answered them very well. the only concern would be the Wifi. I could not get it to work. Line up for arriving was quite long at immigration but they had all wickets open and did move the passengers through quickly. Very quick departing. Thus no concerns. I thought Beijing was much better than most North American airports especially American airports customs can be very slow.,9,1
beijing-capital-airport,Henry Li,China,An excellent airport with excellent services. Beautiful T3. Security is good and the queues are not too long. The air is fresh and toilets clean. Immigration had more than 10 counters in use. The first/business class lounges are clean and quiet. The airport free WiFi is fast - you need to verify using you phone number.,10,1
beijing-capital-airport,F Martin,United States,A very nice airport especially for international travel. It's huge clean with the times as it was built for the Olympic Games in 2008. Signs are in Chinese English etc. Staff is OK and lines to check in can be long but security is prompt. Trains to and from terminals are on time and clean. For the most part everything works well and gets you to where you need to go on time and in the most simple way. I've never really eaten there or bought items from the stores so I have no opinion of those features.,9,1
beijing-capital-airport,Ted Zimmerman,Canada,Flew from YVR to PER via PEK and back. On the southbound leg we spent 7 long cold hours at T3 in the middle of the night waiting for our connection after navigating through an unnecessarily complicated transiting process. We took advantage of the 72 hour visa-free pass to Beijing on the northbound leg and found immigration was generally efficient and staff did their best to answer our questions and guide us through the process. Security was the standard fare and lines moved reasonably quickly. T3 is visually stunning but there are few shops and fewer restaurants contained in its cavernous halls. Despite having been built for the Olympics this airport still invokes 70s era thinking in its design. No mass transit to or from the airport. Travellers need to take a train to access the gates. And amazingly we had to take a bus from the gate to the tarmac to board our Air China flight despite numerous empty gates and unused bridges. Each of these links reduces efficiency and adds to travel wait times. Unacceptable for a supposedly world class airport built in the last ten years.,3,0
beijing-capital-airport,Thomas Riddle,United States,The worst airport experience in almost 50 years of travel around the world. Arrived at 0200 in the morning no food no safe water nobody to tell us where we were to go to catch the aircraft to the Philippines. No heat in the terminal while it was snowing outside the ladies washroom was filthy approx. 40 seats in a huge terminal if you wanted to sit you sat on the cold floor. All terminal personnel claimed that they did not understand English. Had to offload our own luggage and finally when we found out that we were to wait for a bus to terminal 2 we had to load our own luggage onto the bus. Finally when the restaurants opened at about 0800 my wife and two other ladies ordered an egg omelette and tea waitress took $20 up front and offered no change.,,0
beijing-capital-airport,D Freed,United States,One of the least convenient international airports in the world. Enjoy the bus ride transfer from Terminals 1-3. Everyone is rude and the security is slow. Immigration is inevitably backed up too. If you can fly through Hong Kong or Shanghai or Guangzhou or Seoul.,,0
beijing-capital-airport,John Kou,United States,Overall it doesn't seem to be as bad as the reviews say. Though it's not Hong Kong or Changi terminal 3 is large and clean. When comparing this experience to my international arrivals experiences in Newark and Chicago Beijing takes the win. The staff seem friendlier and more organized than in the United States when it comes to immigration and security. Plus the building and facilities are a lot cleaner than most U.S. airports.,8,1
beijing-capital-airport,Steven Cao,China,Worst airport I've been to! T2 is very old and dirty really needs to be refurbished restaurants are all overpriced. T3 is big mess very long walk to the boarding gate dirty toilets extremely rude security staff they are just busy talking and chatting with each other never seem to care about the long queue of passengers.,2,0
beijing-capital-airport,Fiona Fu,Australia,Not too bad perhaps the big crowds cause it to be a bit chaotic now and again. I have been in Beijing airport more than 20 times in and out it's quite reasonable. To be honest it's better than Australia and UK.,8,1
beijing-capital-airport,Mel Smith,United Kingdom,We only had an hour to transit on an Air China flight and it was a total nightmare. The queues were massive to get through immigration for transit. In fact on the way we left the airport which was far easier than transiting. Our flight was on final call and we still had not got through immigration. A staff member was shouting our flight number and got everyone running to the other side of the airport where we were left and later told to rejoin the queue that we had just left! This delayed us further! We did make it in the end after we ran to get on the flight. It was total chaos and it is very strange that you even need to go through immigration (twice) when just transiting. The staff were very unhelpful. The airport needs some serious reorganisation and more than 2 counters open!,,0
beijing-capital-airport,N Raven,Canada,Passed through on YVR-PEK-SIN Air China flights. This place is huge dreary inefficient and wreathed in a toxic smog. Had a 3-hour connection window which was almost not enough. As an international transit passenger I had to queue for a passport check and transit visa then I got dumped into the general security screening which was chaos. This happened on the way back too. Both flights out of PEK were loaded using buses out to the tarmac. This when several terminal gates were available. So a big plane loaded via one stairway in the cold and smog. Not nice and unacceptable for a big newish airport and its national carrier. Even the Air China lounge to which I managed to get access on a 6-hour layover another time is dreary and makeshift. Avoid this place.,1,0
beijing-capital-airport,L Moulton,Indonesia,I chose to fly Air China outbound from Singapore to London Heathrow and then LHR to Bangkok. What a disgrace of an airport to a country such as China. Terminal 3 is a modern building but transiting here is a nightmare at the best of times. Immigration staff stamp transit passengers' passports even if they're not entering China yet when I got off my flight from LHR a large Boeing 777-300ER at least another large aircraft arrived at the same time containing many transit passengers. Despite there being at least 400 passengers only TWO immigration counters were open. Luckily I didn't have a 1 hour connection time and wasn't one of the last passengers. Worse still there was no queue guidance systems such as 'snake' lines that have rapidly improved the situation at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi. On top of that facilities aren't great and sign-posting for facilities like money changers are poor at the best of times. Also on my flight from SIN to LHR via PEK I had a 6 hour transit so I paid for lounge access but on the whole it was a waste of money with no western food save for tasteless sandwiches and biscuits. To sum up China's government really needs to improve this airport and make it more foreigner friendly if it is to improve its image. Until that day comes do not transit here unless you have a long connection time of over 2 hours and even then its only worthwhile if the cost-saving is substantial.,,0
beijing-capital-airport,Andre Elyanov,Germany,Terminal 3: Huge modern building everything is new and expensive. The Immigration transfer counters are overcrowded only 2 counters open to serve all transit passengers. Line of 30 meters long with people waiting even if you do not intend to visit the country you have to come through immigration and get a red stamp in your pass. Unnecessary. Immigration officers are unfriendly putting their stamp right in the middle of the empty passport page making it not usable any more. WiFi is only available if you have a Chinese SIM card. Very bad in other airports your flight ticket and the passport are already enough for getting 1 hour of free WiFi but not in Beijing. Huge Halls with many shops but only selling in Chinese currency and nowhere to see a single money exchange. Using your credit card for buying a sandwich? No thanks!,,0
beijing-capital-airport,Timo Hessling,Germany,First trip to the new airport very clean lots of toilets and also charging stations for electronic devices. Because I arrived early in the morning (6am) and at night (11pm) most of the shops and bars had been closed only Starbucks was open. Not a lot of bars or cafes but a lot of shops. I can't understand why the shops and bars are closed when passengers still arrive or depart. I had two transfers flights no long queues at transfer counter customs and security control. All went very fluently. If you are arriving or depart in winter from this airport please wear warm clothes most parts of the airport are not heated very well also the gangways the to the plane are freezing cold. Overall a good airport.,7,1
beijing-capital-airport,Mcqueen Delaney,Singapore,Horrible experience a long walking time needed to reach gates and still have to waste time to take the train in the departure lounge to gate. Check in counter staff were extremely rude and condescending - they banged my passport on the table impatient as there was a long queue behind me. Took exactly 1.5 hrs just for check in and customs - way too long due to long queues and inefficient lousy staff. Duty free shopping in Terminal 3 was nonsense few shops and few benches for waiting. Also airport security is so poor for a capital international hub like Beijing airport! There was no security trying to stop these illegal sales people trying to sell you luggage straps in the terminal itself before checking in. Airport is practically lifeless after 10pm - shops close cafes shut down for the night - what kind of International airport is this?,1,0
beijing-capital-airport,Rita Sandoval,United States,"First trip to China and I enjoyed novelty of everything including the airport. However I went in the summer so the cold described by others wasn't a problem. The shops were ok and airport staff were pleasant. I was surprised on the way back that after going through security etc. there was a female security officer on the actual tunnel leading a few yards away from the plane door. She searched purses etc. of people about to board. I said ""Chinese security is very good!"" and the stern faced young guard broke into a wide smile. Part of casual travel is just taking in the moment. I will be going back in January. Will be interested in comparing the experiences.",10,1
beijing-capital-airport,J Jensen,United States,An airport to be avoided for transit. A completely unnecessary (and long) immigrations queue for all transit passengers then two security checks. We were among the first to arrive at the checkpoints at which all bags were thoroughly hand-searched. Long queues formed behind us. Our checked bags clearly marked Priority didn't make it to our connecting flight even though there was plenty of time - more security issues? Will choose a less paranoid airport for international transit in the future.,3,0
beijing-capital-airport,Kelly Watt,Canada,"Nice looking airport but no air conditioning and no heat. I sat for 10 hours on layover in zero degree temperatures freezing ""inside"" this airport in a t-shirt/jeans while all my warm clothing was transferred through to Canada via my flight from Thailand. The people are rude the money changers charge a $10 service fee (changed $30 for lunch and I got only $20 back after fee) and overall the staff is not willing to help. I will do whatever I can to never travel through this airport again!",2,0
beijing-capital-airport,Andy Lin,Canada,Good airport but they do not have enough elevators for passengers who need to transit from the arrival floor to departure floor. The train is very crowded the international flight arrival hall is too small and crowded. Overall it is not a good airport but not bad.,5,1
beijing-capital-airport,J Shen,Canada,I landed at night through PEK T3 from PVG. Airport is clean and modern. It has a huge space but seems lifeless after 10pm. Not much to do at all. Some shops like Starbucks are outside the check-in hall. Airport staff are knowledgeable and willing to help.,5,1
beijing-capital-airport,K Yoshida,China,I am working in Beijing but never liked Beijing Capital airport especially T3. It is a modern huge facility managed by fewer-than-necessary and inefficient staff. Many seemingly impressive facilities are simply unstaffed and unused. Long queuing is a must for check-in (even with E-ticket have to line up with paper-ticket passengers just to check luggage) no airline staff available to help you auto-check-in though more than half of the ticket- issuing machines are out of order or accept only Chinese national's ID not passports. Security check is time- consuming and what I hate most is the long walk from the departure lobby to the gate. Souvenir shops all sell same things and priced 3-5 times more expensive than in the city. T1 and T2 are much smaller and quicker to go through but the airlines using T1 and T2 are somewhat penalized for longer taxing time. Baggage handling is very slow (at least 30 minutes) and misleading (they put wrong flight number at a wrong counter I have encountered this problem at least 3 times). During Summer the airport often closes due to rain or other natural causes and their dealing with passengers is just horrible. We are left to wait without any sound update for more than 4 hours. I try to avoid using T3 or flying in China at all as much as possible.,2,0
beijing-capital-airport,B Poon,Hong Kong,I'd say the only plus is about terminal cleanliness - toilet is very clean compared to most attractions in Beijing. Talking about queuing time all pax had to pass through two security checks. The first one before check- in was fine but it took a VERY LONG time queuing for passing through Immigration and the second security check. PEK also lacks a wide variety of shops - all shops are duty-free or shops selling luxurious goods. But I was disappointed that my plane had to queue up for over 40 mins after taxi for taking-off!,5,0
beijing-capital-airport,A Alorro,United States,I don't understand why as a transit passenger you still have to pass through immigration and customs. I can understand one security check before you board the plane but 3? That is just ridiculous and this adds to the stress level of catching your connecting flight to your final destination. And to top it all off they charge you $20 per head to transport you from one gate to the next. What a rip-off this airport is.,4,0
beijing-capital-airport,E Wong,Hong Kong,"Just returned from a trip from HKG to CDG via PEK. Probably one of the worst airports I've been to. I was on a transfer flight and was not leaving the airport just going from gate to gate yet I need to get my passport stamped and go through security again. I proceed through customs. I pass through the scanner fine without it going off but was still stopped and checked. Inside the airport the air-conditioning is so weak that the whole airport is so stuffy. On my flight to Paris we got onto the plane fine and it left the gate as scheduled then we had to wait an hour next to the runway while the plane waited for clearance from the ATC. On the return flight to HKG again we got on the flight fine but then ""apparently"" due to weather we were delayed 4 hours. We did not get to deplane so passengers just sat inside a small stuffy plane with little news on when we can depart. 4 hours passes then captain gives us good news that we leave. Then we once again move out to runway and wait here for at least another hour! I will never book another connecting flight at this airport again.",,0
beijing-capital-airport,Mary Butcher,United Kingdom,I travelled through Beijing Airport on 21st April this year. It is freezing cold so if you are travelling now take a warm jacket as all the airport staff were wearing big coats. Whether it's normally like that I don't know but it is very cold. When on my stopover to Australia I had a shower in the hotel by gate E10 - it costs £15 150 Yen. I nearly fell backwards but I was ready for a shower so agreed to have one. I have to say it wasn't all that good or hot but I felt better for it. Coming back on my journey I saw some free showers near one of the pagodas/temple behind Costa Coffee. As I'd only taken a small amount of money with me the cost of the shower took half of my allowance which meant on the way back by the time I'd bought a coffee (it's so expensive) I didn't have enough money left for some food. I was in a freezing cold airport for 6 and a half hours and ready for a meal on the plane home. The airport is spotlessly clean immigration and shop staff all need to smile a bit more though. I would recommend this airport because of the cleanliness but would say be warm and take plenty of funds with you if you are spending quite a while there. There are lounge chairs in certain areas where you can relax and watch the planes taking off and landing.,5,1
beijing-capital-airport,A Newton,United Kingdom,The most bizarre large airport I have ever transited through. on all 4 flights I had in and out of PEK we did not use the airbridges and were transferred by buses. Security and immigration for transit is insane only one member of staff on the transit immigration desk for 2 full plane loads of passengers. The staff manning these points I found to be rude and abrupt. The airport was freezing cold I saw many people walking around with big coats to try and warm up. Good thing is there was free wifi but as a non Chinese citizen you need to take your passport to the information desk to get wifi passwords. The airport has so much potential I do not see it as world class yet.,3,0
beijing-capital-airport,P Vanelli,Italy,I often fly in and out of Beijing mostly through T3 and I find this terminal to be most annoying. The terminal is very poorly designed with unnecessarily long distances. What really drives me crazy is that when you arrive you end up in a hall which is not located at the same level of ground transportation so you must take either an elevator (there are just two of them!) or an escalator to reach the taxis / buses or the parking lot. If you have a large piece of luggage this can be quite difficult to manage. On the plus side I have never waited too long for immigration. Baggage collection on the other hand is variable (up to 1 hour once for a flight from Europe). Food choices are really limited considering the size of this airport. I definitely prefer T2 even though it's more crowded.,3,0
beijing-capital-airport,J Isaksen,Finland,The only plus here is the open space and lack of lines when arriving early morning at least. Passed through twice. Very limited places to eat. Too many empty high end stores and looking for a bottle of water was a challenge. Not aimed at International traveller needs. No co-operation between Air China staff. Speciality lines handling irregular visa travellers were there but not handled very well.,5,1
beijing-capital-airport,A Syed,Australia,Good airport but staff not very efficient especially with their level of English very poor. Check-in staff had to call about 3 or 4 members to translate from Mandarin to English which is still not great! But other than that great facilities very clean and spacious. Another problem encountered is no connection to social media in fact very limited usage of the internet. Will still visit Beijing again regardless.,5,1
beijing-capital-airport,Michael Pobjoy,United Kingdom,Big big airport but for a modern airport disappointing. With so many docking points why should people get off planes and face winter conditions and sardine cramped busses? Also whilst in transit why do passengers have to go through immigration and back again and subject them to excessive baggage and body searches? Airside there was a lack of money exchanges was unable to get any money the potential of this airport is enormous.,2,0
beijing-capital-airport,G Scott,China,For allegedly the 2nd busiest airport in the world it is probably the worst large airport I've ever been to. While there are times when check in and security queues are really short there are other times when they are ridiculously long. The constantly use buses to take you to and from the planes which is fairly outrageous for such a modern airport. The worst thing is there is such a tiny selection of shops and restaurants and they are all vastly overpriced. I've been through Beijing Capital airport at least 30 times since T3 opened and every time end up disappointed.,3,0
beijing-capital-airport,B Marcus,United States,I arrived from Hangzhou and arrived at T3. It did Not take that long to claim my bad but the taxi line was ridiculous and I waited almost 45 minutes. For a modern airport they need a better system for their taxis. I departed T3 for my United flight to Newark. I was very surprised that there was No Fast track line for Business Class passengers. Going through immigration took over 30 minutes and the line through security took another 25 minutes. There was Not a large selection of restaurants and shops. I much prefer Hong Kong Kuala Lumpur Singapore and Seoul airports than Beijing T3.,5,0
beijing-capital-airport,W Hammond,Singapore,"Perhaps the worst and most disappointing ""new"" airport in the world! Landed at T3 gates took 30 mins to get through immigration then you inexplicably have to jump on a train for 5-6 mins to get to the main terminal. The extremely few shops were closed and it was 11pm. Then stuck in an awful taxi queue for 1 hour. Overall it took me nearly 2 hours to get out of the airport then you can add another 40 mins to the city. By the time I checked in to the hotel it was 1.30am - 2.5 hrs after touchdown! Flying out was just as bad T3 is huge biggest terminal I have ever seen and completely empty of anything bar check-in desks - there's nothing to do no shops or bars or anywhere to relax and everywhere is closed by 10pm. The satellite terminal where all the departure gates are is even more desolate and so dark you can't even read a book to pass the time.",1,0
beijing-capital-airport,J Sung,China,I live in Beijing and dread going to the airport and I travel 3 times a month on average. Taxi queues are messy (up till recently) and can be extremely long especially late night. Lounge has limited service offering. Immigration line for foreigners (inbound) are extremely slow (but this is the same for almost all Chinese immigration). Baggage claim is slow. T3 is huge but there is nothing much in it (restaurants shops services etc) especially at further gates. Flights are often delayed.,2,0
beijing-capital-airport,Josef Sonntag,Israel,PEK-PVG Xian-PEK SVO-PEK PEK-SVO. Arrivel at PEK very efficient clean with good information good ground services very efficient ground service (electronic self check-in) and good restaurants.,9,1
beijing-capital-airport,Y Ren,Australia,I think PEK has improved. Landed at Terminal 2 with China Southern from Hanoi and departure from Terminal 3 to Singapore. Immigration and security staff are friendly and efficient luggage arrived quickly. Airport express train is easy to access and only takes 20 minutes to get to city. More shops opened at terminal 3 staff are friendly and helpful. Airport business lounge has plenty of food choice. Check-in and boarding are smooth free wifi available through PEK.,9,1
beijing-capital-airport,D Scott,United States,Agree with the comments on cleanliness. Disagree on some signage - not clear where you transition from domestic to international - there is a sign but you have to be looking for it. Staff English skills are hit and miss if you ask them the same question they hear many times a day they can handle it but the slightest deviation and they struggle but they are friendly. There is lots of walking security is long and laborious. Had a long layover outbound and a short one on the return my opinion is 2.5 hrs between flights is the minimum.,6,1
beijing-capital-airport,F Harvey,United Arab Emirates,We had a 3hr 30mins stopover in T3 and were very impressed by this terminal. Signage was good terminal was immaculately clean shops were decent and there were several relaxing areas with long chairs two 'Temples' with a small pond and a few benches. Finding an ATM was hard but there were several Bureaux de Change. The only annoyance was that we had to go through a separate immigration queue on arrival even though we had an international connecting flight outside of China.,4,0
beijing-capital-airport,L Charpentier,France,Very good impression on arrival less than 30 mins from aircraft to taxi. Unfortunately taxi drivers don't speak English. On departure check in counter open 3 hrs before flight very good no queue at security checks or customs. duty free area - not enough shops. Quiet airport.,5,0
beijing-capital-airport,Micke Akesson,Sweden,Newly built and looks pretty good. If you have to stay in the airport for more than an hour you will quickly become bored. Very limited in both shopping and eating. Staff are not very friendly and security is a hassle even in transit. English speaking personnel is rare.,2,0
beijing-capital-airport,M Gill,Canada,We flew through Beijing on our way to Delhi and then back to YVR. The new terminal is big and clean. You have to walk a lot. The airport seemed deserted even at 8 pm. Limited eating facilities close to gates with no international flavour and choices. There was a small tea shop near our gate and it had one piece of cheese cake and had just ran out of milk/cream for coffee. The map showed the restaurants were 10 mins walk from my gates. I tried to use the automated phone using my credit card but the instructions were not clear and I just gave up. The terminal was cold so were the personnel working there. Take note: I was advised at a duty free shop at YVR not to buy any alcohol because it will not be allowed to go through Beijing. It is best to buy liquor there if you are in transit. But the choice is limited shops don't operate 24 hrs a day.,3,0
beijing-capital-airport,B Ngan,Hong Kong,So many vehicles were blocking the drop-off area at the entrance of the terminal which was a mess. The airport offers no directory of shops and restaurants. Food selections are so limited and none of the restaurants are charging a reasonable price. The train transferring passengers to terminal 3E shakes at departure and arrival is like a roller coaster.,2,0
beijing-capital-airport,C Craemer,Germany,The duty free shopping is ridiculous. Were there at 8 pm and none of the shops were open. The food was okay but most of the staff don't speak English. Airport was clean but was very cold at night. At arrival very uncoordinated queues with Chinese staff shouting at people who were Europeans in Chinese - so that no one understood anything. If you asked them to speak English they became very rude.,2,0
beijing-capital-airport,David Gartside,United Kingdom,T2 - the 'old terminal' as our guide described it - if that's old  I'll settle for it. Clean and efficient lots of shops for those who want such things enough quiet corners for those who don't.,5,0
beijing-capital-airport,Joseph Schmitt,United States,I can't believe that no one has mentioned how cold it is. My wife and I had a 9 hour layover on March 21. The temperature in Beijing was about 32 degrees F and the airport did not seem much warmer. Another annoying thing is that they make you go through customs even though you are in transit and only connecting to another flight. The signage for the transit customs seemed a little lacking - customs officials were terse. Other than the coldness and redundant customs the airport is not too bad. The best and cheapest place to get food is the Chinese Fast Food place (the name escapes me). I think that if you want western food you are going to pay more for it than the Chinese food. They have lounge chairs that are good for catching some ZZZs. Just follow the signs. I've never seen these in other airports. Good Idea. They also have hot water spickets in certain locations. If you really want to eat on the cheap they sell those Ramen type noodles in heat able containers - just add the hot water. I am giving an overall Poor rating because of the cold temperature.,2,0
beijing-capital-airport,J Singh,United States,I arrived in Beijing for a connecting flight to Delhi India. I was amazed in the new Terminal 3! Very clean modern and great staff. It was a big walk from gate to gate but they did have people movers and some small cars operating.,5,0
beijing-capital-airport,Y Ren,Australia,Immigration process was smooth both for landing and departure officers friendly and efficient - some officers also prioritised passengers with small kids go through special lane. Luggage arrived ahead of me. Airport express train was great no queue for taxi either. Air China business lounge was good - the suggestion for PEK is shopping staff are not that helpful and very limited choice.,5,0
beijing-capital-airport,Michael McNeel,Canada,T3 is just massive. Inside the passenger terminal there is no Starbucks Dunkin Donuts or other western franchise. Instead a Chinese coffee shop where they sell a tiny cup of Americano for 5 dollars. Duty free shopping was a nightmare too - poorest service I've ever had. Airport immigration? Slowest ever! I simply have no idea why this airport received 4 stars.,1,0
beijing-capital-airport,A Clemonsky,Canada,The design and structure of the airport is very similar to that of Hong Kong's Chep Lap Ko airport. The staff are quite cold and indifferent whenever they are asked a question. After immigration more international stores (Starbucks MacDonalds etc) should be opened.,3,0
beijing-capital-airport,V Bhar,India,T3 is massive possibly the largest terminal I have been in. Given its size the distances are large and time consuming. The terminal itself is very clean airy and well designed. Some English signage missing or confusing. Immigration both ways was fast and efficient. Luggage wait negligible. Wireless internet didn't seem to work. The retail and food options need improvement. More taxi bays required - we had to wait almost 30mins in subzero temperature to arrive at the head of the taxi queue.,4,0
beijing-capital-airport,J Drolet,Canada,T3 is huge beautiful clean and new although a shocking lack of amenities airside compared to HKIA for example. Getting through Immigration & Customs was smooth & officials are friendly & pleasant. I used T1 for a domestic flight to Xi'an. While it is older & smaller it is still very clean & the staff are friendly enough. Many domestic flights board from a bus that takes you from the terminal to the plane on the tarmac so that feels like a bit of a throwback to an earlier era.,4,0
beijing-capital-airport,Peter Goldsbury,Japan,For my flight from Hiroshima via Dalian there were two pick-up areas for the baggage one for Hiroshima and one for Dalian but there were no signs in English for the Hiroshima baggage so I had to go back into the immigration / customs area and start again. There was no problem with this so I suspect that it often happens. Given the huge size of this airport I cannot understand why planes are still parked away from the terminal and buses used to convey passengers with the inevitable free-for-all. For the return trip I was accompanied by a Chinese guide so the check-in procedure was very smooth. It took about five minutes so there was no sense in having to arrive three hours before departure. I flew Business Class so the ratings are higher.,3,0
beijing-capital-airport,F Runcie,Canada,This airport is huge and airy with a wealth of shops in the area near the gates. Despite the presence of people movers some distances are unnecessarily long. The hairpin turn before immigration services is a case in point and Transfer passengers desk needs to be more clearly signposted. Perhaps most problematic about this airport is the lack of wireless internet service. It is advertised in a number of places but never available. The information desk staff seem unable to provide assistance with this matter. One good thing about this airport is the presence of showers for use for a nominal price.,2,0
beijing-capital-airport,R Ducker,United Kingdom,We used Terminal 3 flying in from Helsinki and had no problems at all - short queues at customs and immigration a bit of a long ride on the train to collect your luggage but a lot better then having to walk that distance. On leaving set off from hotel nearly 4 hours before the flight but taxi journey only took 35 minutes check-in took 10 minutes so we had a lot of time to kill for our 10:55 flight. Terminal 3 could do with some more western food outlets the one we used (a famous country & western singers eatery) the staff had a very poor command of English - apart from that a very good airport.,5,0
beijing-capital-airport,Anders Tham,Sweden,I was in transit at the Beijing Capital Airport. First impression was the airport is huge and clean. However there is only 1 Chinese restaurant operating there. And their service is on- par or lower than the fast-food restaurant. Before getting into the main transit hall transit passangers (even does not entry the country) are subject to the queue of the immigration control. After that yet another baggage scanning. First many didn't understand what was needed of them (look at the web-cam for photo shoot) and this makes the officer angry. Probably those who work there has very little interest to speak English to the international transit passengers. I like the fact the airport provides power terminal for laptop and etc.,2,0
beijing-capital-airport,B Fruin,China,International Check in is not bad. They need bigger notice boards to say where your flights are checking in. A long way to go to the aircraft via a train which doesn't hold near enough people. Returning to Beijing is a absolute shambles. Clearing customs can take a long time as they don't have enough customs windows open and you can wait forever if 3-4 flights arrive at once. Then there is the train to the baggage collection. If you have any oversize baggage you have to go miles to find it.,1,0
beijing-capital-airport,J Creasman,Singapore,Dim lighting and a cold feel. No interesting shops - only designer shops and duty free shops. No magazine or electronics or toys. Choice of eating is dismal - sushi or a bar or a coffee shop. Not a pleasant way to spend a few hours.,1,0
beijing-capital-airport,Simon Maguire,United Arab Emirates,Arrived in Terminal 3 international flight. Nice bright and airy had to wait a bit as security lines were slow train to main terminal area where bags arrived fairly promptly on the belt. Return was great no queues at check in for Qatar flight which is the last to leave at 2am. Terminal was fairly deserted no queues at security either. disappointed that the duty free and most shops were already closed even though we were there at midnight. nice terminal only criticism is there is plenty of walking to be done to get from check in to gate.,4,0
beijing-capital-airport,K Lim,Singapore,This review is for Terminal 3 the international terminal. Beijing Airport is a pleasant and modern airport albeit one that feels a bit like a huge empty cavern. Free WiFi is available. However you need to register in person at the Business Center or a few other airport locations to get a user ID and PIN code that you then need to submit via a rather user- unfriendly web page. Apart from the cumbersome activation procedure I have no complaints about the WiFi service. The staff are generally polite and efficient despite their limited command of English. However there need to be more dining options within T3; currently there is little else aside from a Chinese  Pizza Hut and a bunch of cafes. Overall it's a nice place for catching a flight but definitely not somewhere you'd want to linger for long at.,4,0
beijing-capital-airport,G Davis,United States,T3 - Lots of great shops and places to eat. The Air China Business Class lounge is the best lounge I have been in. There is a little hotel at gate E-10 (all the gates for international flights are the E gates in this terminal). It has mini rooms with no windows that you can rent by the hour or even overnight. Caution - when you arrive if you are connecting internationally and already have your boarding pass or want to go rest in the hotel do not follow the crowd down the escalator after customs. This leads you out of the terminal and to baggage claim via a train. If you do accidentally get to the train just take it to the main terminal and then don't get off. It will take you back to the E terminal where you will have to clear a new set of customs and security to get back into the gate area.,5,0
beijing-capital-airport,H Bond,China,"Disorganized sprawling airport that is too big to be practical. Like C Neumann experienced twice the ineptness of airport information staff. There are no floor plans showing which row and number of stall holds which airline check-in desk. Aimlessly wandered in the airport looking for Continental desk. Found Info desk gave info staff airline flight number and time of flight. She told me ""this flight does not exist"" multiple times and on the third try searching on her computer found said flight to exist and directed me to the correct row--in row E (it is not alphabetical order which would be the intuitive thing). Second time found airport staff and asked again where is check-in desk and she did not know despite working on the check-in floor aiding travelers. She had to radio the info desk. After multiple tries info desk did not respond. Had to walk to info desk who did not know either and had to look on his computer (they should really know this without resorting to looking it up). She ended up directing me to the wrong check-in desk. From check-in to gate is much too far. Besides walking long distances it requires a shuttle ride to the gates where you must walk long distances again. Security was terrible no organisation. People cutting lines drifting in and out of lines. No one spoke English. Was in danger like some other travelers of missing flight due to excessive security delays. Every once in a while an airport security worker would walk by. If I had not asked in Chinese for help because my flight was leaving soon I would have missed my flight altogether (worker removed me from the line and brought to the front cutting all the people behind me.) Was late for flight and no one bothered to radio ahead. Allot yourself at least half an hour from check-in to gate plus more for security. Airport staff has none to minimal English skills. Bad service from shop assistants prior to gate.",1,0
beijing-capital-airport,Y Ren,Australia,T3 is fantastic T2 is a little bit dated but services are good. Immigration staff are friendly and efficient. heaps of shops and cafes. The only is internet there is no free wifi services at PEK.,4,0
beijing-capital-airport,Bill Jones,France,Beijing Airport has a lot of superlatives and is fantastic when everything goes smoothly. I was delayed coming on Air China from Hangzhou (bad weather in Beijing will probably appear later in the statistics as pollution-free day) and had to catch Air China flight to Frankfurt. This flight departed just when we landed. Transfer desk is useless: they send you to ticketing in ticketing you have to wait in queue (whereby Chinese people do not queue they just push you away) and when you are done with ticketing you wait in queue (same style as before) to get accommodation. The whole procedure took almost 3 hours.,2,0
beijing-capital-airport,Kostas Sapountzis,,It has a good and cheap connection with the city and although huge it's very well organized and you can find your way easily. But due to its size you have to leave enough time for check in gate transition etc. Among his disadvantages was the luck of proper services for disable people. If it wasn't the polite and helpful personnel I don't know how easily we could have made it. Another big disadvantage it was that the very expensive restaurants and cafe facilities. We paid 30RMB~3Eu for a plain and small sandwich and 27RMB for a small glass of juice!,4,0
beijing-capital-airport,C Neuman,,Had a connecting International flight in Beijing and could not get proper directions. Airport personnel were indifferent and unhelpful with one person even asking for money just to tell me where the Continental Airlines counter was. My son and I had a miserable and tiring time filled a ton of forms had to go through immigration and in again!,1,0
beijing-capital-airport,A Lee,,Terminal 3 is enormous but seem a bit under-used. Had a domestic transfer with Air China from YVR to SHA via PEK and was a smooth process. Had many stops and stamps to my passport and tickets but I can honestly tell you that I had no idea what I was getting stamped or checked. Still a fairly smooth process and lot's of walking involved. I felt like I walked the whole airport just to get to my next flight! Unlike many North American airports there are not a lot of opportunities to purchase snacks or water after security. If you want food I recommend eating before proceeding through security since there is not much in the departure area. Also found it odd that for such a large airport I had to be shuttled to the plane for both of my flights. Overall a pleasant experience!,5,0
beijing-capital-airport,Steve Conroy,,PEK Terminal 3 is a truly remarkable building - the sheer size of the place can be quite overwhelming. For this reason it can take a while to get from one side to the other. In my case I took nearly 30 minutes to make my way from my Dragonair flight to immigration - and this was on a quiet Sunday morning. You will never experience overcrowding! Check-in areas are adequately signed and customs staff are efficient if not a bit dismissive. Previous comments are correct: there is not a lot in the way of eating facilities once you clear immigration for an outbound flight. Most of the shopping is for high-end duty free. However this airport gets full marks for cleanliness ambiance and efficiency. Overall a very good airport.,5,0
beijing-capital-airport,R Pontida,,Transportation to/from the airport is cheap both by bus express train and taxi. Terminal 2 seems like a low-cost terminal and waiting lines are usually long for those flying economy. And a lot of flights depart a bit late. But Terminal 3 is a piece of art. It's huge and from the inside it's really beautiful. As stated by P Smith it's also vastly underused which means I never had to wait was it for immigration security check or anything else. You have free power outlets for your laptop with free Wi-Fi like in Incheon for example but in my opinion with better natural lighting (although with no signs).,4,0
beijing-capital-airport,P Smith,,Beijing Capital is the most ridiculously oversized airport I have every seen. It is a political monument more than an airport. On the positive side you will never feel crowded out. On the negative side there is almost nowhere to eat (including the airline lounges which are sub par) and you better leave 20 minutes to get to your gate.,3,0
beijing-capital-airport,M Bates,,The new Beijing Capital Terminal 3 is architecturally fantastic especially from the air. The check-in area is huge and not too crowded and generally easy to navigate and I have always found the check-in process to be reasonably smooth whether for domestic or international flights. However things go downhill from there. Although the check-in area is huge all the passengers are congregated into one smallish area for access to the gates. Domestic passengers have it easy in that once through the security check the gates are right there in the same building as the ground side area. But as in the old terminals at this airport it seems like the airport authority likes to bus as many passengers as possible to remote stands which is simply ridiculous in a modern airport. It is even more ridiculous when you are on the bus looking at the airport with most of the gates unoccupied and all the planes parked a mile or so away on remote stands. I have travelled on domestic flights through this terminal eight times since it opened last year and only once have been to a proper gate. As for the international passengers all have to go down two escalators to a train that is often broken. You then get transported out to the furthest of the three buildings at the end of the dragon (the intermediate building is not in operation yet) where you then immediately go into the passport control and tiny queuing areas for security. Once through into the airside terminal be sure to have a jacket as it is always about 10C in that building. There are lots of glitzy shops to spend money in but almost nowhere to eat. For such a grand project there are so many small problems with this airport that could have been fixed with just a little thought. Regardless of this it is still 100 times better than the two other decrepit terminals at this airport.,3,0
beijing-capital-airport,Mark Bickerton,,T3 is fantastic! Huge beautiful and well organised it puts many other major airports to shame. There are places where you can sit quietly and relax which is actually what I prefer to do at an airport rather than eating or shopping.,5,0
beijing-capital-airport,S Manniex,,This review is for Beijing Capital Airport's Terminal 3. The new and ultra modern terminal 3 would be much better if it had free wifi internet access. It is possible to access a hot spot however it isn't free it requires a Chinese mobile phone number and the login page is displayed only in Mandarin. The information desk staff need to speak and understand decent English (because it's an international airport after all) and also need to know exactly which facilities are available in which locations. A better selection of shops that cater to those of us on a budget is required - for example convenience stores stocking everyday items at everyday prices not just expensive tourist junk. Travellers from western countries like to eat things other than McDonalds KFC and Burger King. Please provide some healthy western options.,3,0
beijing-capital-airport,C Tin,,T3 basically a newer chinese version of HK int'l. HUGE airport long walks to gates though. But everything clearly labeled in English. Immigration a breeze no lines both times and they actually are nice at the airport. Quite a shock. Train a little inconvenient and it doesn't come that often but all in all very impressive for China as I've flown into a bunch of chinese airports.,5,0
beirut-airport,M Dalton,Switzerland,"You queue for a long time to go through the first security. I had only carry-on bags so I did not need to approach the check-in desks. Then you make your way to the ""Ticket Check"" counter where two desks were available and the queues were long. Then you discover that they do not accept online check-in printed boarding cards. So, you return to the check-in counter and push to the front to get a boarding card, a business line was non-existent. Then back to the ""Ticket Check"" counter, push to the front. Then join the throng at passport control. Processing was slow. Then to the gate, but no! Another security check. I will try to avoid this airport in the future.",1,0
beirut-airport,S Fedorak,Lebanon,Something has to be done about the inefficiencies and nonsense at Beirut airport. We absolutely dread going through it and can hardly wait until we leave next year. There are endless security lines which wouldn't be so bad if they were orderly. Then there's the Passport Control line. My husband and I have flown into and out of dozens and dozens of airports around the world and never have we endured such slow lines. What on earth are they doing that takes so long? And again Lebanese cut in front so by the time we are through these lines we are so annoyed that we refuse to even consider looking or shopping in any of the stores. As far as food services its almost non-existent.,,0
beirut-airport,A Milossavlyevich,Serbia,The best airport in my opinion or at least my favourite. The terminal building is wide and spacious divided into two wings. The personnel are professional helpful eloquent and proficient in foreign languages. Unlike many airports in the world the duty-free area is not an aggressive maze you're virtually forced to enter on your way to the gates it is a very discreet area but that offers an extensive choice of virtually everything. A seamless experience. There is also a small Arabian sweets stand at the entrance of the duty free area after the passport-exit control. Classical music is played inside the terminal. Security? Was so quick that I don't remember passing it which in the other airports makes you not to want to travel by plane again in the next few months. (Same for immigration on arrival can only remember the friendly officers.) There is Wi-Fi around the terminal although it wasn't completely functional the last time i travelled. Finally the gates area is a delight with carpets comfortable seating and windows offering complete view of the apron and the runways. Again the indirect lightning is so pleasant! Another small but important detail you could find electrical sockets everywhere (which are virtually non-existent in places such as Istanbul Ataturk). All in all there can't be a better way to enter/depart Lebanon.,9,1
beirut-airport,S Robert,United Kingdom,DXB-BEY. Small airport. Limited facilities. Rude attendants and airport stuff. Bad impression of Lebanon. Boarding screens out of service. Check-in queue was very slow. Boarding chaotic on Emirates A345 they could have use double airbridge but only used one. Very disappointed. Damascus Airport is much better.,1,0
beirut-airport,S Markoff,Serbia,Arriving from SHJ BEY was a very pleasant surprise. Clean and very well organized polite staff with excellent level of foreign languages. I highly appreciated the presence of old trolleys not requiring a handle to be pushed for moving them considering the latest innovation present at most airports today everything but useful.,5,0
beirut-airport,Peter Thackray,United Kingdom,Arrived in late evening from LHR. Immigration a smooth operation and bags came relatively quickly. Arrivals Hall no obvious sign of a Bank to change money which was in fact up stairs in the Departure Lounge. Similar story on the way back with very little delay in being processed. Airport has recently been modernized and upgraded to allow for most flights to depart from a pier rather than a remote terminal. A reasonable range of Duty Free shops with the usual collection of watches and alcohol and a couple of small souvenir shops. Much smaller than a lot of other Middle Eastern Airports but good all the same.,4,0
beirut-airport,Dave Stanley,,Clean and modern airport. The duty free is OK and the business lounge good with a decent selection of snacks. Wifi is available in most areas.,4,0
beirut-airport,David Allan,,Very clean and modern airport with adequate shopping and F&B facilities. Fast throughput and friendly staff (except security). Only criticism would be that immigration is exceedingly slow.,4,0
beirut-airport,N Vanian,,Beirut International Airport is more than capable of handling the influx of visitors this summer. With the recent opening of the western wing of the airport it now has a total of 24 gates which means it can accommodate 24 planes at a time. The opening of this wing has increased to 40 the number of passport security counters. Obstacles in the air transport sector had been lifted in an effort to boost tourism and as of this year private charter airlines are allowed to operate from Beirut. The Lebanese government has licensed 11 Lebanese-based companies as passenger charter carriers. These new charters will work with Lebanese tour operators but will fly routes on which MEA does not operate. I am sure the industry can carry the weight of competition. A total of 45 airlines now operate out of the BIA the newest one from the Gulf including Oman Air. The fact that most visitors can buy a tourist visa on arrival at the airport is added incentive to travel to Lebanon. Visas are granted for up to a year and a return ticket is now no longer needed to enter.,4,0
belem-airport,A Hijmans,Brazil,Medium-sized modern airport; clean and easy to navigate around. Easy public transport to and from city centre.,8,1
belem-airport,S Koenig,Brazil,Small for a supposedly international airport but the only international flights I saw listed were to Suriname. Terminal building was clean and modern albeit somewhat sparse. Plenty of small shops and places for snacks. There is one larger restaurant/bar with a view of the tarmac. Taxis appeared to be plentiful.,4,0
belfast-airport,M Higgins,United Kingdom,"I visited this airport with my sister for a flight back to London Gatwick on Friday 15th May and the staff in all the shops and bars were absolutely fantastic and had a friendly and welcoming nature but my good feeling was shattered when we went through security. The lady whose queue we were in was barking out orders relating to phones ipads etc at all the customers and throwing around the plastic trays as if she was ""throwing her toys out of the pram"". We placed our luggage in the trays only to be told/growled at that ""You don't need to put your cases in the trays"". We said that this was procedure at Gatwick but she just didn't listen. She picked my case up and hurled it face down on the conveyor belt. It was a good job I didn't have an iPad otherwise it would have been smashed. She then barked at me ""Is this your bag?"" which actually wasn't as the owner had already gone through the screening arch. She then decided to pick on my sister by shouting that the plastic bag with the toiletries in was not acceptable she replied that it was OK at Gatwick so why not here? There was no response to this other than a tiny plastic bag being thrown at her with the result of her having to put some items in my toiletries bag or throw them away. We both went through the screening arch and I got stopped screened and searched but at least the young lady there was sympathetic when I asked her to be careful as I'd had a hip operation and was still in recovery. I think that overall the Security staff have a difficult job to perform which is very important to all our safety and security but when you are met with a surly rude arrogant condescending ""Rottweiler"" it is not a very good advertisement for the Airport or Northern Ireland in general.",5,0
belfast-airport,B Bradley,United Kingdom,On outward journey before going through security the first cafe on left only managed a stone cold cooked breakfast that had to be returned. Had to leave without anything to eat. On return passengers have to climb flights of stairs with hand luggage no lift for senior citizens. Security is fine by me we all need to feel safe travelling so read the rules get the right size of plastic bag wear the right shoes etc. It is annoying but necessary in all airports so why do people take it personally if stopped for any reason? Having listened to some moaners in my queue they are usually latecomers from the bar or are ignorant of protocol. In both cases a lesson in their own courtesy wouldn't go astray. Since we are all in the same boat or plane in this case shouldn't people lighten up as so as we can all have a more pleasant experience in the airport? Security staff have a job to do and as far as I am concerned when my children and grandchildren are travelling through continents there are few jobs as important. As for loos and like every other airport not enough loos for ladies!,4,0
belfast-airport,R Mccammond,,I think Belfast international is a lovely place to arrive and depart from. All airport staff are friendly and always willing to help if you have any questions. People complain about security if passengers followed instructions and not pack unsuitable items in hand luggage it would be much quicker. You cannot blame the staff there and I have witnessed some very rude passengers with their attitude to staff in general. BIA is a credit to Northern Ireland and gives a good impression to visitors and local people as well.,9,1
belfast-airport,A Doherty,United Kingdom,Security staff overbearing but not that clued in. Made much fuss about plastic bags android tablet etc. Totally ignored my electric toothbrush when the brush head is pulled off there is a sharp 3 inch steel spike. On return journey after a 5 hour flight we had to climb a long stairway. Many old people on our flight were gasping for breath at the top. Luggage reclaim area looked like something from the 1950's. Despite our flight arriving 20 minutes early we had to wait 45 minutes for the luggage.,1,0
belfast-airport,S McCaul,United Kingdom,"Arrived on Sunday from Amsterdam with 2 Dutch visitors. First thing that amazed them was having to walk across the tarmac in pouring rain and then having to carry their hand luggage up a steep flight of stairs to enter the terminal building. They really cracked up when they had to negotiate a ""Slippery Floor"" warning sign with a bucket behind it catching drips from a leaking ceiling. They were finally accosted by a member of staff at passport control who would need a few lessons in manners. Belfast Intl airport is a disgrace to Northern Ireland. With so many golfers expected to enter the country over the next year or so I shudder to thing what their first impressions are of our country is.",,0
belfast-airport,B Fielding,Netherlands,I've been to lost of airports but the fanatical way the security is behaving towards liquids in hand luggage reeks like a rip-off scheme. I brought my liquids in a slightly blue transparent plastic bag. According to the security people it had the wrong color and I had to buy a new plastic bag for £1. I have never experienced this in any airport in the world. It somehow felt that the security guards were in on the scheme and could divide the plastic bag earnings at the end of the day by themselves. I loved travelling in Northern Ireland and loved the friendliness of the people but the experience with the security guards left a bad aftertaste.,1,0
belfast-airport,Joe Park,United Kingdom,Travel through BFS in June No shopping except Duty Free just eating places. Arrived back 1 week later with 2 flights arriving within 10 mins of each other and we had to queue for 45 mins to get through Passport control! You wonder why they are not attracting new international flights! They just don't have the facilities or manpower.,,0
belfast-airport,C McAlin,United Kingdom,I travelled through Belfast International Airport last week and my overall experience was good. I found the Airport to be small and quiet which was nice as airports these days are a bit chaotic at times. I went through security with no issues although the large scanning machine is a bit intimidating seems like something out of a sci-fi movie. (Is this thing really necessary?) The Security Staff were very friendly and processed my items in a timely manner. I didn't have much time to shop which was good because the selection was not great. That being said I did see all the usual places Coffee Shop Newspaper Shop Duty Free etc.. A clothing shop within the airport would be nice though. There was no public address announcement to go to the gate which kind of spoiled things as I had to constantly look at the Flight Monitor for information. Staff at the boarding gates were friendly and the walk outside to the aircraft was short. I had no issues upon my return although the baggage hall in the arrivals area would need some paint soon. Overall I was satisfied with the service I received in Belfast International Airport and will be using the airport again.,7,1
belfast-airport,Gareth Ferguson,Australia,Terrible dirty outdated airport! This airport needs a serious upgrade failing that it need demolished and rebuilt! There are hardly any air bridges for planes to dock so we had to walk around 300 meters in the winter wind and rain to get inside to airport arrivals area. I felt sorry for elderly people on board our flight who got soaked! The baggage reclaim area is dirty and for an international airport only has 2 baggage carousels! Toilets are dirty and outdated! One other thing about this airport I really noticed around the terminal entrance was the sheer amount of discarded chewing gum that was caked into the pavement directly outside this is absolutely disgusting and not a good impression for first time visitors. The road to the airport from Belfast is terrible which takes you in single lane traffic from the motorway to the airport which means getting stuck behind slow moving commercial vehicles once again I have seen better airport roads in the third world! No train link at airport even though there is a station pretty much beside it! No under cover car parking at airport so be prepared for another soaking!,,0
belfast-airport,S Smith,United Kingdom,Like other reviewers I was told my plastic bag was too large after it had passed through the x-ray machine though it had been acceptable at Gatwick. I had to leave my liquids with security because I wasn't prepared to participate in the plastic bag scam. A very unpleasant experience. I will avoid flying out of Aldergrove again if I can.,1,0
belfast-airport,G Raper,United Kingdom,Security staff at this airport are horrendous. Have a stoma passport but official refused to even consider looking at it. This contains information regarding my condition and what can be done in public and when there should be a private 'frisking'. Have never been treated like this at any other airport. And as for the search this too was far too personal. No one got through without being searched whether the machine bleeped or not. Officials were surly and very aggressive and do not give Belfast airport a good recommendation. It spoilt what was a great visit to a beautiful city.,,0
belfast-airport,Andrew Wilson,Ireland,My wife and I have used this dreadful airport twice in the last month. Fortunately we will never have to again. The security staff are not only aggressive and rude they are ignorant of even the most basic hygiene. I had liquids in a sealable plastic sandwich bag which I have used to go through airports on several continents including Belfast but on the last occasion the woman at security decided after it had been through the scanner that it was too big and would have to buy two smaller ones from their machine. She wouldn't allow me to put my goods in the new bags and tried to do it herself. When I objected to her handling it her boss snarled at me and insisted on doing it himself with bare hands. I then put it back in my original bag while he watched and said nothing. In other airports security staff are not only reasonably pleasant but wear gloves to handle personal possessions. They also provide plastic socks for people who have been required to remove their footwear. At Belfast they just assert that the floor is clean despite have been walked on by hundreds of pairs of outdoor shoes!,,0
belfast-airport,J Cun,United Kingdom,"I thought I was the only one who had complaints about Belfast International airport. The normal staff were helpful but the security staff were atrocious ignorant and nasty. Two experiences I had: My elderly mother was asked to remove a gold chain from her neck the chain was put carefully in the tray went through the x-ray machine but did not appear the other side. It was taken to the notice of security staff who basically said the necklace was not put on in the first place and there was nothing could be done. I refused to move until they got a member of management and the necklace turned up under the machine. Secondly an antique pocket watch was swab tested even though the watch passed through the x-ray machine without a problem. From one security extreme to another. Arriving from Amsterdam late one night there was a telephone on the ""goods to declare desk"" along with a notice saying that there was a staff shortage and if anyone had anything to declare please lift the phone and advise a staff member. One final complaint the smell of urine from a toilet behind the first restaurant as you go in was very strong one urinal bowl was leaking from the outlet and had a bucket under it. When I got back from holiday I emailed the airport and was told it would be taken care of. 2 months later I was back at the airport and the same bucket was still in place. Visitors must think they are entering a 3rd world country.",,0
belfast-airport,A Gilchrist,Spain,Unfortunately I have to travel out and into this abysmal airport for business purposes ever other week. I have read a lot of comments here and I now see in the news that it has been voted 4th worst airport in the UK. I'm surprised that it is not first. The staff at the security are ignorant! The queues are always long and totally mismanaged. Even if you clear the security scanner ready for the wander round the shops they will take a part of your luggage ie your phone and do a swab on it. Don't expect any early morning newspapers either as they wont pay the staff to come in to put them out. Get them before you go through security if you are lucky. I travel over 100 times per year out of various airports. I detest going through this one. Perhaps its a good thing that the security is so slow. Means you dont have to spend as much money at their shops if they are even open!,,0
belfast-airport,Michael Preston,South Africa,I have used this airport both inbound and outbound about 6 times November last year. Perhaps I have been lucky as when I've passed the airport it has been very quiet no long queues for check in or and everybody has been polite and pleasant. Facilities are a little limited but adequate. The seating areas at the are uncomfortable and sometimes cramped but overall it's a friendly airport and staff are pleasant helpful.,9,1
belfast-airport,C Lawrence,United Kingdom,I flew from Alicante to Belfast at short notice on account of a family funeral. Disembarkation was frosty on account of the very surly and rude immigration and security staff. The transport links to Belfast are expensive. Facilities at the airport are functional. I was frisked by their security people and asked questions about my destination and purpose of visit. I was insulted as I am an EU citizen. This airport does not give a very good impression of Belfast.,5,0
belfast-airport,S Dillon,United Kingdom,Every time I have used this airport over the last 20 years security staff have been rude and overbearing. On my most recent trip this weekend I was frisked despite not setting off any alarms it is a pain but no big deal. This time however they decided to stand my 10 year old son to one side to wait in line with grown men to be frisked I was informed by a right battle-axe to step away from the boy. Meanwhile all our bags have been opened and the security man speaking to my wife asked about wrapped gifts in one of the bags. My wife explained they were presents for the children. Unfortunately for me and my family it's the only airport we can use for the journey we do and I'd love to know what staff training has been provided over the 20 years I've been using it as nothing has changed.,,0
belfast-airport,H Wheeler,United Kingdom,"Rude overbearing and overly jobsworth security staff! The plastic bag used to fly out of Gatwick airport was now 2"" too long for the return flight. Staff treated passengers like criminals and in the short time we were there saw more than 10 people treated very rudely. Will never use again!",2,0
belfast-airport,Norman Alexander,United Kingdom,Flew from Belfast International to Alicante recently Check-in staff ok. Security staff atrocious. We were made to feel very ill at ease. They were very rude and abrupt to everyone in general. The only reason we suspect the public take this treatment is the fear of repercussions i.e. missing their flight. They should be sent to Alicante airport to take lessons.,2,0
belfast-airport,Ian Robinson,United Kingdom,The security staff have actually improved over the last couple of visits but are still far more surly and domineering than most other UK airports. My real gripe here is the drop off charge - I get whoever is dropping me off to leave me at the roundabout beside the only Hotel at the airport its a quick two minute walk from there to the entrance.,5,0
belfast-airport,Alan Jones,United Kingdom,I found the security area to be fast and without issue I had no problem with any personnel as a lot of people who have left reviews already seem to mention. In other areas of the Airport I found the food to be expensive in the cafe adjoining the security area and in the fed and watered bar but apart from that everything else was fine including check-in which was quick and straightforward.,2,1
belfast-airport,T Ward,United Kingdom,I no longer use this airport as they consistently squeeze every last pound they can. Smokers - £1 trolley users - £1 plus £1 pp each time per passenger for set down and pick up. As for the food gourmet prices for greasy spoon quality just about sums it up. But what you should really ask yourself before using this facility is - given the extended time frame over which scores of other reviewers have lambasted the surly security staff attitude why have management not addressed the issue?,3,0
belfast-airport,C Webb,United Kingdom,I dislike travelling through this airport. They revamped the security area yet still have minimal numbers of scanners open and you still have to lug your bags across a wooden table to get them on the belt. Security staff are shouty and in common with many other reviews complete jobsworths. There is a real lack of seating in the departure lounge. It's like to get a seat you have to buy something. Free seating is also really uncomfortable - metal with no cushions. And you have to pay for wee plastic bags for liquids. This airport really is about squeezing every last penny out of travellers.,2,0
belfast-airport,A Magowan,United Kingdom,What a shame. Belfast International used to be a lovely airport a real pleasure to travel out of. These days however the feeling you get as you walk through the door is that they want to squeeze every penny they can out of you. For a start most of the seating has disappeared only to re appear in the food outlet area so now to sit down you either have to be at the airport first thing or buy overpriced food. Add to this a £1 charge to pick up or set down £1 for a trolley and £1 to use a smoking room. I found security to be ok not as friendly as Heathrow but certainly not as bad as Newark. I found that the servisair people were quite rude I stood at the servisair booth for 10 mins before one of them acknowledged me and asked me to wait. Overall this is an airport that used to be pleasant to fly out of but now it really is a chore.,2,0
belfast-airport,C O'Neill,United Kingdom,Small changes (yet again) from my last trip through. There is a new food area called 'fed and watered’ where 'Rankins' used to be (nice but usual airport high prices). Also after leaving security you are deposited into the recently refurbished original food court area looks nicer but is still over-priced. My personal impression of security (see previous reviews) was a little better than usual on this trip but only just and from observing interaction with other travellers it's still poor. The term 'officious' in previous reviews reflects my experience of security well in general. The web site shows that the current round of investment has now finished so that unlike the last few years the airport probably won't change layout every couple of months. Finally I have neglected to mention before my experience on return. UK boarder control has been excellent and the baggage hits the carrousel very quickly. However in stark contract to the departure experience this part of the airport hasn't changed in a long time and now feels old worn and tatty it really needs a lick of paint.,4,0
belfast-airport,R McCullough,United States,I recently travelled via Belfast International. I wanted to see if I was the only one with this poor experience. I wasn't and Mr Davis's review sums it up - The security staff at the Belfast International Airport obviously mistake officiousness for efficiency and really seem to enjoy the little power they have. I travel a fair bit 50k flight miles a year and I find Dublin and London security staff generally friendly and good and equally the TSA have really upped their game not Belfast Intl. Even to the point of making me unpack my backpack after it had been through the machine and being asked why did I have so many electronic devices. They'd already been rude and inefficient throughout the process to myself and others. It was a toss-up for me between flying to Heathrow from Belfast to get a direct flight from there to get home and a 2 hour train ride to Dublin for a direct flight and clearing US immigration in Dublin. Belfast Intl airport security have made that choice easy for me its Dublin for me from now on. One customer you have chased away and travelling is hassle enough.,3,0
belfast-airport,John Davis,United Kingdom,I've have the misfortune to travel via this airport 3 times this year for business. The security staff at the Belfast International Airport obviously mistake officiousness for efficiency and really seem to enjoy the little power they have. As a country that relies heavily on tourism someone should realise that although they are doing an important function they are customer facing.,3,0
belfast-airport,G Dalton,United Kingdom,Arrived at Belfast Int. airport Easyjet check-in. Stood in queue for over 30mins. Only one girl on check-in desk. Off-loaded suitcases and went straight to security check with intentions of eating/ shopping once through. One item of hand luggage was targeted for searching items were scrutinised in detail. In total well over 10 mins must have passed from opening of this single bag to leaving security. By this stage we all had to make a dash for the departure lounge as boarding was commencing. As yet no drinks or food for the kids. And usual story with Belfast Int - passengers are despatched from the seating bay into the stairwell where they have to remain standing before being released (about 10+ mins). In past flights we've had to stand for even longer periods in these conditions. Total time to get through airport with no breaks: over 70 mins. It would seem many passengers are opting to make the short trip down to Dublin.,2,0
belfast-airport,A Jones,United Kingdom,Travelled through the airport recently for the first time in 2 years was pleasantly surprised by the new layout the security staff couldn't have been nicer despite all the seemingly negative reviews here. Lots of space in the departures area though the strangford eating area is very over-priced with simple meals averaging £10.There is however a burger king and a nice bar and a few shops such as WH smith and boots as well as the duty free area of course. I used the business lounge but it was my first and last time in it as it simply isn't worth the money there are plenty of quiet areas to sit around in whilst waiting for your flight and the large window in starbucks lets you see out over the airfield.,3,0
belfast-airport,Tony McLaughlin,United Kingdom,New improved security area and the terminal is being re-furbished again. A lot of the comments about the security staff are true and this is the only downside of this airport.,4,0
belfast-airport,J Richards,United Kingdom,I travel through this airport around 10 times per year. I would describe the overall facilities and cleanliness as average. The security queues are generally long. Following the recent refurbishment there is very little seating in the departures area although there is customer- only seating at cafes.,3,0
belfast-airport,P Cairnduff,United Kingdom,Being my local airport I have used Belfast International many times watched it develop and be refurbished over the years. The relocation of security was a good move as the search area is so much bigger now but it's a real shame that the staff can be so unpleasant when dealing with passengers I have had to have my bags searched the last two times I have travelled out and they didn't even give me a reason why they were doing it and seemed annoyed when I had to ask them. That aside the other services and facilities remain of a high standard and the modern departures concourse makes a pleasant start to your trip. Really pleased as well that easyJet and more recently Aer Lingus are continuing to expand their routes and you can now fly to a great range of European destinations without having to make a connection elsewhere.,4,0
belfast-airport,C O'Neill,United Kingdom,My first trip through Belfast International since November and it's changed again. Just a little this time although thankfully for the better overall. Check-in was a breeze despite there being a number or flights checking in at the same time. Security however was the usual story. The officials that check documents before entering the main security area are polite friendly and efficient. However after this the lines in the main security section despite being short were painfully slow. Only 1 male and 1 female member present at the scanners meaning that if anyone set off the detector the queue was held up for people of the same gender for some time with chaotic reorganising of the line to sort it out. Staff were also as abrupt and surly as ever. After this though the latest reconfiguration of the departure lounge was actually quite good. The old duty free area is now opened up into seating for starbucks and other outlets giving a more light and space for travellers.,4,0
belfast-airport,David Graham,United Kingdom,I have to say that the security queues and security staff at Belfast International airport compare very unfavourably with other airports. Queues are long and move at a snail’s pace (in spite of the fact that this was the smallest and least busy of the airports I used recently). Security staff rude and even abusive to passengers in the way they talk to them. They seem to treat everyone like some kind of criminal.,2,0
belfast-airport,Z Wilde,United Kingdom,The most horrendous airport. Security over zealous and jobsworths. They make travelling by air the most unpleasant experience imaginable. Before they made changes to security I had never come across such a disorganised and unacceptable processing times - now it is quicker but equally ridiculous. Removing the landside retail outlets has taken away any remaining character it had although the food outlets were very poor quality. The only good thing there is Starbucks but that is looking shabby now and needs a clean/facelift.,1,0
belfast-airport,F Griffiths,United Kingdom,Unbelievable experience with security. Do they really think a 60 something granny flying to Newcastle is a threat? They tested my creams - don't know what for or what it achieved body searched me twice etc. Place was empty - maybe they were bored. Then through to the one cash machine which never works. Poor selection of food. Poor seating - wire mesh.,2,0
belfast-airport,C O'Neill,United Kingdom,Since my last trip earlier this year it has changed again. The long stay car park cost me about £25 for one week earlier this year - now £40. There is also now a £1 drop off fee for anyone getting a lift to the airport once you have turned off the main road in to the airport grounds it is a 1 way system and you are committed to driving through the system with no way of avoiding a charge of some description! Once inside the terminal the landside is the same as it has been since the changes started to be made. After the security check the airside has changed a lot. There is little space to relax now with far too much emphasis being placed on trying to ring money out of passengers though the retail outlets. Apart from a couple of rows of seating in the middle of the departure lounge all other space and seating has been given over to food and shop outlets. All in all travelling through Belfast International seems to become worse with each visit. There is no thought given to making it a nice experience travelling through and instead all changes are geared to shoehorning in more retail units. Since the start of redevelopment I've seen no changes that really the improve passenger experience.,3,0
belfast-airport,C O'Neill,United Kingdom,Security staff could learn how to provide their service with a little more friendliness. I've never found them rude as such but from time to time a little abrupt. As the airport is in transition from old to new it's hard to give a real opinion as the last few times I've been it's been different on each visit. On the plus side the new bits are clean and bright. On the minus they have lost the great charm of the old airport and the addition of the new shop units in the airside section (that until recently was landside) now cover what little window area there was. I like airports that let you see the planes taking off and landing. The viewing gallery has been gone for some time now sadly closed but still there. No real change to the function of the airport and the passengers ability to pass through that is genuinely noticeable so for me what is mainly cosmetic change may look more modern but it has lost as many points of charm as it has gained in modern appeal. The only real gripe that I think would be the same for most would be the quality of food and its price! Starbucks is the only reasonable place to go. Inbound the walk from baggage reclaim to the exit is a little anonymous by that I mean you walk along a few blank empty corridors that leave you wondering if you've taken a wrong turn! Not a bad airport but room for improvement and I think the planners need to recognise this place had a charm and it shouldn't be buried in a drive to have a bright white clinical looking new layout.,4,0
belfast-airport,D Crawford,United Kingdom,I fly through this airport quite often and although its new entrance and security area are quite nice I do miss the old landside eateries and cafes and especially the viewing gallery! Its a bit of a mismatched airport with some parts being brand spanking new and clean and some other parts still looking very old and dated. Gate 22 is the only gate with an airbridge (most of the carriers are low cost anyway) which was recently replaced with a newer one and is used by Continental for the flight to EWR. I find the security staff quite rude and tend to run you round like cattle.,3,0
belfast-airport,Geoffrey McNab,United Kingdom,Passing through Aldergrove late morning was a doddle. The new security area is bright and clean and there was hardly anyone else in the queue at all. I was through fairly quickly and discovered the old Burger King and Food Court area once a landside area has been incorporated into the airside area so there is a much better selection of eating places to choose from whilst waiting. It looks as if the money being spent on the airport will be worth it in the end. I departed from Gate 16 and it is worth noting there are no toilets down at this level. The closest are beside the Business Class lounge before going down the steps towards Gate 16.,4,0
belfast-airport,K Pardi,Italy,Security staff are rude customer services are non-existent and a shock for the modern airport. Unless I am really pressed I prefer to avoid Belfast International Airport and use Belfast City or Dublin.,2,0
belfast-airport,S Scott,,Poor signage throughout. The new security area was slow to get through (half an hour last Friday) staff scrambling to retrieve the trays why no automatic rollers? is this a temporary arrangement? poor system for the queue after the end of the roped of area queue people all over the place! with one poor man trying to keep order! Then the security staff were not particularly pleasant at all. Poor layout/design all round. Have flown in and out of Bristol for many years and it all goes so much more smoothly there!,2,0
belfast-airport,A Magowan,,Not a bad airport facilities are ok it's clean and easy to get around. My one gripe is the quality of food vendors with prices over and above what you'd pay at even Heathrow! Security was easy enough to get through and staff pleasant enough.,3,0
belfast-airport,R Gray,,Have used this airport twice in recent weeks and was impressed by the new security area which now the space formerly taken by the WH Smith landside store. A staff member managed the security queue effectively and it did not take long to negotiate. My long standing gripe with Belfast Intl is that the baggage reclaim area in arrivals is open to all and sundry. I've always though that it would be very easy for a bag to be removed from the carousel by a non- passenger. At every other airport I've used the reclaim area can only be accessed by arriving passengers.,3,0
belfast-airport,A Lawrence,,The staff are all very helpful and very professional and what's more there are frequent bus connections just outside the airport terminal which is of great relief to all without cars. The airport will be able to rival some of the world's finest when then new improvements are implemented i.e. when the new terminal and multi-storey car park are completed sometime by 2015 I'm not certain when exactly - but it will be a must see for those who wish to experience a good time.,4,0
belfast-airport,D Thompson,,Staff are friendly and the airport is quite easy to get around from check-in to the boarding gate. BFS needs to have more air bridges - only have one at gate 22 which continental use every day for their service to Newark. Security staff can be a bit rude at times.,4,0
belfast-airport,A Gilchrist,,The only gripe I have about this Airport is the security. The long queues the unfriendly security staff. The long wait if your bags have to be checked. On one occasion there was a chap in front of me who had flown in for a connecting flight to Europe - when he went through security they said that the plastic bag that he used for the liquids was too big. He said that he always used this one at every airport. So they took out a ruler and measured it - it was 5 mm over and they told him he would have to buy one from the machine conveniently placed after the security for £1.,1,0
belfast-airport,M Preston,,I found the airport user-friendly in all senses. All the employees are helpful and welcoming the facilities are good and even when my flight out was over 2 hours delayed I found it pleasant enough not to mind the delay and it was also uncrowded.,5,0
belfast-city-airport,Sammi Lammy,United Kingdom,"I travelled to Northern Ireland for the first time recently, flying from London Heathrow to George Best Belfast City Airport and back again. It is a well-functioning small airport that does not require a lot of time for check in and security. However, finding the gate was a bit tricky as the upper level departure lounge with shops and restaurants has some ""zones"" A, B, C and D - yes after security - and the gates are below. I was in a rush after my friend was stopped and questioned by British immigration officials and we lost some time. In that rush the layout was a bit confusing. The planes park close to the building so even without the ramp/tunnel to the aircraft, boarding the plane is no hassle - unless it was pouring down rain. A much, much more convenient airport for Belfast than ""Belfast International.""",8,1
belfast-city-airport,D Vanderpuye,United Kingdom,Travelled yesterday and met with the rudest and over the top security staff from G4S security check in. I'm all for the safety and security of our air space and I also believe common sense is essential when dealing with situations as when people stop travelling it will mean no jobs at the airport. I couldn't believe the G4S supervisor on duty at around 11am publicly and rudely told me that security at Heathrow were not doing their job properly by allowing me to travel with same liquids they were refusing me to travel from Belfast ie pressed powder 20ml shower gel mascara and 20ml toothpaste. I was kept at security for about 35 minutes just because the length of my mascara would not allow the plastic bag clip close and she made me feel like a criminal when another traveller who saw the silliness of the whole situation offered to carry my mascara in her much bigger plastic bag. Eventually another G4S staff who had common sense allowed me through seeing what an unnecessary aggravation I had been put through. Would not recommend this airport due to the G4S staff.,1,0
belfast-city-airport,C O'Neill,United Kingdom,"The outbound experience was OK the flight was delayed by just over an hour a small delay in the world of airports but with this airport being so small it did mean that time started to drag just a little. Had the flight departed on time then there should be just enough to keep most people entertained enough prior to boarding. Security staff were OK to pleasant enough in contrast to my last visit. Although oddly despite checking in online it took a while at the airline check in counter as they printed our parties boarding passes again as apparently security prefer the ""proper"" ones that the check in desk produces. The only gripe but it's a fairly big one was that on return we were practically thrown out of the terminal with a group of other passengers as despite our plane only touching down at 9.15 we had to be collected by bus from the plane though immigration collect our bags and be out of the terminal and off the property by 10.00! The lady who came out to shoo us all out wasn't really that polite about it either and with our party and 1 of the others having passengers in wheelchairs this process is a little more time consuming. On going outside to the drop off/pick up area to await our lift we were then told again (a little more friendly this time) by a man that we'd better be quick as there would soon be someone going passed to lock up the main entrance/exit gate! The lady had said they were closing at 10.00 and repeated that they aren't a 24hr operation that's fine but its not a reason to close the whole terminal and throw everyone out on the street so abruptly.",5,1
belfast-city-airport,Ian Strachan,United Kingdom,Staff in this airport very abrasive including security taxi and 600 shuttle bus drivers to the city centre.,,0
belfast-city-airport,Mike Jacques,United Kingdom,Fairly quick through security though not all screening positions were in use. This airport seems to be getting more busy each time I visit and sometimes it is difficult to find seating.,8,1
belfast-city-airport,Stephen Johnson,United Kingdom,This airport is disgraceful. The G4S staff getting you through security have to be the worst i have experienced in my worldwide travels. What they don't seem to understand is they are not providing a good service and visitors to Belfast get a terrible impression of what little the city has to offer. They need to have a good look at this airport as I and many friends prefer to travel to Dublin. Now that is an airport!,,0
belfast-city-airport,Ken Gibson,United Kingdom,"Departed to LHR late afternoon on 24 May and returned mid morning on 8 June. Check in and security fine - no delays but maybe that time on a Saturday is slack. Seats in the departure area dirty and litter lying about. the ""gate"" area literally a covered walkway with no seats is depressing - reminded me of BHD 25 years ago. On return luggage collection very slow for a 40% full flight and baggage area has a well worn appearance about it. Toilets in that area clearly had not been cleaned for some time. Would only recommend if no alternative.",4,1
belfast-city-airport,S Y Chew,United Kingdom,"I went through the security check yesterday on 28th May 2014 about 7.15pm. The staff who was responsible on telling all passengers to put their liquids bag and coat on the tray was very rude. He was ordering us all ""Go get a tray"" ""Put it on a tray"" ""Go out and check your bag in"" ""You go away"". No eye contact at all. Even if we had not done it right but please be polite. Also the flight was delayed. Coffee shops rushed to shut by 8pm and they switched the lights off when there were still customers seating on 1/3 of their tables. They did not come over to table by table to inform us that they were closing. If they had told us we could had finished our food quickly and left the cafe. Unfriendly staff. We were all shocked and unhappy with the experience in Belfast City Airport.",2,0
belfast-city-airport,Frances Knowles,United Kingdom,I flew from Belfast City airport to Leeds Bradford with my elderly Mum who is 94 . All I can say was from leaving Belfast on 15th May and coming back from Leeds Bradford on the 21st May was super. All the staff from wheelchair assisted floor staff greeting staff check in and cabin crew were helpful and pleasant . Many thanks to you all my journey was made so much easier with your help especially caring for my Mum.,10,1
belfast-city-airport,G Colburn,United Kingdom,Snazzy little airport only five minutes on the bus from the city and inexpensive too. The usual array of shops and a bar called Bushmills are more than adequate for an airport of this size. A minor gripe was the walk down to the boarding gate a bit of a trek along a dark and dingy corridor with the wind howling in your ears. Boarding was speedy and the staff were excellent if only other airports would follow this example. A credit to the city of Belfast.,8,1
belfast-city-airport,K Alexander,United Kingdom,A very poor first impression when arriving. Passengers are faced with a long walk down a dark and dingy corridor. The carpet tiles appear to be water stained - leaks from the roof perhaps? No air bridges here - you are exposed to the elements when boarding or disembarking. The seats in the main terminal are looking very tired - many have rips on the cushions and are well worn. On departure security would not accept my online boarding pass and I had to return to the check in desk to obtain a regular one. They said it was because the airline had changed the flight number! The airline stated that security hadn't updated their system - Poor service indeed.,3,0
belfast-city-airport,A Magowan,United Kingdom,Nothing has really changed since I was last here except all the eateries etc are now located upstairs. Security was pretty slow with only one lane open but when a queue started to form they opened another lane however only had one metal detector running which led to the inevitable bottleneck! Had a reasonable lunch in the bush mills bar with a light lunch for two coming to just under £20. As with all airports these days there is an acute lack of seating upstairs most of the seats seem to be within the 'harvest market' restaurant. Seriously about 3/4 of the seating upstairs is located within one of the eateries with just a small handful of 'free' seats. Overall not a bad experience although with the lack of seats and toilets I wouldn't like to be here when it is busy!,5,0
belfast-city-airport,G Scallon,United Kingdom,On arriving at the airport I was quite surprised to be met with very little seating very pleasant staff very short queue at security which is great but unfortunately as a family of four decided to have some breakfast at the Harvest Market restaurant which turned out to be dreadful English breakfast was inedible and overpriced.,7,1
belfast-city-airport,P Cairnduff,United Kingdom,Have only flown out of the renovated terminal twice but think it's a great improvement on what we had before particularly with the departure lounge moving upstairs allowing some great views of the airfield. My one issue is that between only a few screens and the inaudible PA it's hard to know when exactly your flight's boarding - a screen in the eating area would be extremely helpful so you can relax there instead of having to get up and constantly check.,7,1
belfast-city-airport,Tony McLaughlin,United Kingdom,This airport is growing on me. The baggage reclaim area has now been expanded to 2 halls as opposed to two belts in one hall before. I had hand luggage so I don't know if the delivery of luggage from plane to belt has improved. I always recall it being quite slow.,8,1
belfast-city-airport,J Henson,United Kingdom,Used Belfast City Airport on Sunday 5 August - first of all the bus service from the city centre to Belfast City Airport is very good. It took less than 20 minutes to travel from the Europa Bus Centre to being dropped outside the terminal building. The bus was clean near empty and the ticket only cost £2.20. On arrival the airport seemed very clean and was quiet. The terminal was also full of natural light which I thought was quite impressive. I was through security in less than 5 minutes as there was hardly any queues. Agree with previous comments that there is a lack of non-restaurant related seating and the retail offering while decent for an airport of this size is fairly intrusive.,8,1
belfast-city-airport,C Greene,United Kingdom,Despite spending millions on a new departure lounge I was horrified to see how limited seating was approximately 200 seats 1/3 of which are hidden to the rear without any view. What is also obvious is the massive increase in retail shopping which takes approximately 75% of the available space. Further almost all retail units were displaying merchandise within the concourse and outside their shop curtilage. This impedes access reduces floor space and is a potential hazard during evacuation. It should be banned. Principally this an airport not a retail park so has profit greed got the better of comfort and safety? On a brighter note I would say the Market Harvest and O’Brien’s restaurants do offer a good reasonably priced selection of food and beverages however don't be surprised if you can't get a seat after paying for your food as the take-up of none paying customers is large. It's a real shame that profit greed comes before passenger comfort and safety and they boast the improvements are for our comfort!,3,0
belfast-city-airport,Alastair Finch,United Kingdom,New facilities much better than old one check-in facilities good and fair selection of shops seating good and overall a pleasant experience.,8,1
belfast-city-airport,Sam McFarlane,United Kingdom,It was once a great friendly local airport to fly from but how things have changed yes the airport is modern looks clean with fresh new security that looks like it works well and fast. Airside there are very few seats once you walk past the shops and restaurants the main seating area is cramped and horrible. Very over priced so buy before the airport.,2,0
belfast-city-airport,G McNab,United Kingdom,Security zone seems much improved. Catching a midday flight I was through and into the departure zone in a flash. One aspect of BHD's operation I hate is the miserly way they sting you for things which are free at other airports. Want to weight you luggage to check the weight? Pop it onto the scales and then insert £2. Plastic bags for liquids pop a £1 into a slot and you can get some. Contrast this with a major airport like Gatwick where there are free scales all over the place and free plastic bags at all the security zones before going into departures.,3,0
belfast-city-airport,C O'Neill,United Kingdom,First time in BHD in a few years. Flew from and returned to the airport on a domestic flight. Security wasn't too bad. Duties were dispensed efficiently enough on a Sunday evening. Although as usual a little more smile and basic customer service wouldn't go amiss they were a far cry from the surly folks of the international airport. Once airside I was impressed by the improvements. What was once a small airport is now a small airport that feels a good deal bigger with facilities that punch above the weight of its small stature. Only problem is that from departures all flight board first through doors A B or C and then on to the gate number. This meant that 2 flights were allocated the same door and as such there was very little time between the previous flight clearing the door and mine boarding.,5,0
belfast-city-airport,K Hughes,United Kingdom,I unfortunately have to use this airport every week and really wish I didn't. Its facilities are limited and expensive the toilets are often dirty and there isn't enough seating in departures. The departures gates downstairs are dark cramped and freezing with almost no seating. There is only 1 airbridge which is rarely used so with Belfast's weather you frequently get cold & wet getting on/off planes. Security is slow and staff are inconsistent in applying search rules - they're not always very polite either.,2,0
belfast-city-airport,Tony McLaughlin,United Kingdom,I use this airport a lot - the only thing that doesn't change is the delay of up to 25 minutes for bags to arrive in hall. I only use LHR-BHD route so don't know what it's like for other routes. The airport has been redesigned security hall is bigger which is a major plus and the departure area is now upstairs. I don't think this area is much bigger than before and there seems to be less seating. Great view of apron and runway.,3,0
belfast-city-airport,C O'Neill,United Kingdom,A nice clean and relatively simple airport. Due to it being a small regional facility it is very easy to navigate around. Put in its simplest format you've got the entrance hall departures lounge and arrivals/baggage so essentially 3 large halls all directly connected. Unlike the International airport (Aldergrove) it has a few skyways to allow you to walk to the plane without exposure to the elements. The range of shops is good to (for the airport size). It is clean and bright and allows you to see the aircraft take off and land which is something I enjoy and something that Belfast International now deprives you of. A small personal preference maybe but I like to see out at the planes in an airport!,4,0
belfast-city-airport,James Short,United Kingdom,Arrived on BMI airbridge from aircraft into terminal. Wait for baggage approx 10mins. Small reclaim area with just two belts. Car hire from desk and short walk to car park. Return fast check-in and through security quickly. Departure area having work done so seating mostly occupied. Toilets clean.,4,0
belfast-city-airport,Michael Davies,United Kingdom,Second visit within a week. I arrived at the airport 2.5 hours before my flight so once I checked in I caught the express bus number 600 to the City centre. £3 return takes about 15 minutes. The city centre bus station is near the Europa hotel and there are a good few pubs in the vicinity so I had a nice lunch. Better than the facilities at the airport and more civilised. Bus leaves every 20 minutes and I was back at the airport in plenty of time for the flight. Its easy to do if you have some time to kill. Mid-afternoon flight plenty of people there but the departure lounge never seemed crowded.,5,0
belfast-city-airport,Michael Davies,United Kingdom,Departed at 08.30 on a saturday morning. No queues at FlyBe check in - the self service machine seemed simple enough to operate. A little queue for security - staff very pleasant. I was taken to one side to have my phone examined and the agent was very friendly. Departure lounge upstairs. Nice views over the runway from the restaurant. Had a full Irish breakfast - £10 and perfectly fine. Service a bit slow and I guess this could be a problem with more people around. There was plenty of seating for everyone at the opposite end of the lounge - more than there used to be when it was downstairs. It didnt seem busy although there were a lot of flights departing around the same time.,5,0
belfast-city-airport,G Boisvert,United States,Don't try arriving by train unless you have a cell phone. The route from the station to the terminal goes across the airfield so you have to take a free shuttle; however the shuttle only comes if you can summon it. Although they provide a phone to call the shuttle it doesn't work - the alternative is to call the Security office and ask them to send the shuttle. It was a minor annoyance but as I was already late for my flight it was an unhelpful one - they could just have a shuttle meet every train. Otherwise I can't really complain about this airport - I actually found security to be pretty quick and most of the staff seemed friendly enough.,4,0
belfast-city-airport,D Petersen,United Kingdom,Travelled through this airport again 30/31 March. Ticket barriers unable to accept credit cards. Wrong gate on information board. Wrong gate albeit a different wrong gate given at the departure lounge. Upon return the ticket barrier refused to accept the ticket (23 pounds for an overnight stop in the long term park) intercom for assistance engaged/busy. No shuttle bus seen. It doesn't get any better.,2,0
belfast-city-airport,Derek Adams,United Kingdom,"Recent air-side expansion has added about 60% more retail space yet there appears to be an amazing lack of seating. Clearly the management consider shopping is a better air-side experience for passengers that sitting! The ""expanded security area"" sees the addition of 1 additional x-ray machine (now 4) with two shut down as before. Despite the new more spacious security area not an ounce of pleasantry from security staff could be heard. Seems they have had total transplants of both charisma and common manners. A pleasant ""good morning"" from myself was greeted with a surly ""take off belt and shoes"". Not a ""please"" or ""thank you"" to be heard. Toilets in the arrivals hall are drastically in need of a total upgrade and are reminiscent of a remote third world airport. What a pity as BHD once a pleasant rapidly traversed facility seemingly has totally lost direction with management seemingly out of touch with the comfort needs of the modern air traveller. As we all know a smile ""please"" or ""thank you"" costs nothing.",2,0
belfast-city-airport,D Petersen,United Kingdom,I was impressed by the newness but mystified by the lack of seating. I wonder how it will fare if there happen to be delays or extra services attracted to it. The walk to the car park in the rain was long and cold and there was no shuttle bus to be seen. The exit from the car park was hampered by two of the three ticket machines being out of service. I remain to be convinced it could cope with its ambitious expansion plans.,3,0
belfast-city-airport,G Jardin,United Kingdom,This was my first time through the new BHD terminal and I was quite impressed. Security queues even at a busy time seemed fine. Airside is much better than before with an imaginative design plenty of seats and a view over the runway. Better than I had expected.,4,0
belfast-city-airport,Paul Casey,United Kingdom,Very mixed experience at this airport recently. Pros - transit time from aircraft to exit and vice versa is excellent compared to DUB for example. Cons - unacceptable wait times at security checkpoint. Surly unhelpful staff. Dirty smelly toilets. Very limited food and drink options landside better airside but many closed! Having to wait at gate for boarding to commence in sub zero temperatures for nearly 50 mins. This place has the potential to do much better - look at London City Airport if you want a model for improvement!,3,0
belfast-city-airport,J Davey,United Kingdom,The lacks space. If you are arriving from the UK you fly through like a breeze. It took me 5 minutes to get to the bus from the plane. (No lugage) Security times are dreadful. Once airside its hard to find a seat and at peak times hard to hear the announcements. Its not a very nice experience flying through BHD. If there were fewer flights BHD would be a nice place. The Airport flyer bus is good value and quick.,3,0
belfast-city-airport,Geoffrey McNab,United Kingdom,"Poor old Belfast City Airport! What was once a wonderful example of a friendly local airport seems to be turning into a soul less experience? I stepped into the terminal to find alarms going off and a symphony of building work noise. In fairness to the airport it was only the third day of the new departure lounge and I am sure there were some teething problems. But staff I saw all seemed to be very harassed and grumpy. Going through security no-one smiled at all. I try to be helpful and have my jacket off belt off and have everything ready to put in the boxes. The chap behind the conveyor belt leant over and barked ""shoes""™ at me. Not ""please could you take your shoes off"" or anything polite like that. Just a barked word. The worst part of a Ryanair flight out of this airport is the call to the departure gate about 50 minutes before the flight departs! True to fashion the flight was called to gate 6 in the long unheated cold corridor where Ryanair passengers are herded in line. Here a female regimental sergeant major of Aviance the ground handling agent stood and barked at us all to get into line. As I lined up people were passing by me on the right. The RSM barked at them to join the queue for the Stansted flight. I hadn't heard a tone of voice like that since a teacher in my primary school told me to pay attention! The trouble was these were passengers arriving of another flight heading for the arrivals zone. An Asian family of four stopped and looked confused and another foreign gentleman stopped behind me. What a welcome to Northern Ireland! I had to patiently explain to the gentleman he did not have to queue with me as the arrivals area was just through the doors to the right ahead. This must be one of the few airports where arriving and departing passengers are not strictly separated. Quite why Ryanair force their passengers into a queue for thirty minutes before letting them board at this airport beats me. I am surprised the airport allows them since it means passengers are not in the terminal spending money! One cannot return to the good old days but I cannot help but nostalgically look back to when Belfast City was a great wee airport where the staff seemed happy in their jobs knew the regulars and smiled. Horrid though working hours and wages probably are now at airports a smile costs nothing. Most of us understand we have to be processed herded contained and controlled but it would be nice to have it done in a polite and civil way.",3,0
belfast-city-airport,Derek Adams,Thailand,"This once pleasant regional airport is now way beyond its reasonable planned capacity yet the ever greedy management keep just keep ""cramming them in"" without any apparent concern for passenger comfort. Passing through a few days ago the queue for departures security checking had over 100 passengers waiting and stretched outside the terminal to the ""arrivals"" taxi queue! ""Upgrading"" the security area is currently causing regular 40/50 minute delays-after check-in. Airside insufficient seating had passengers standing and blocking walk ways whilst awaiting their flight departures-and this was mid-afternoon in November as opposed to a peak high season departure time. The arrival of Ryanair and the proposed January arrival of Easyjet (from BFS-Belfast International) has added to the considerable strain this facility was under over 3 years ago yet there are no signs of the expansion of passenger facilities. The ""passenger collection point"" was once a tin cabin in a far off point in the car park has dissapeared and has been replaced with an open plastic covered ""wind tunnel"". Add to this the proposed extension of the single runway to accept bigger longer range aircraft and total chaos will surely ensue unless passenger areas are at least DOUBLED in size and facilities. Perhaps the smooth spin-talking management should have to catch a flight from their own airport as ""ordinary passengers"" to experience just what their ""customers"" have to suffer. If this airport was a retail outlet it would have closed down years ago through its atrocious customer services and lack of management concern for those who pay their wages. By comparison this airport makes passing through London Heathrow a pleasant experience!",1,0
belfast-city-airport,Kevin Tunnicliffe,United Kingdom,"Extremely convenient for transit into the city (12 minutes after getting into the taxi). I had no luggage to collect and as I was arriving from another UK airport no immigration so no comment on those. On return I was troubled by the poor layout for the airport security system. The man checking ID and boarding cards kept shouting to ask people to keep moving. No one could because the two security lines open were working flat out and the ergonomics of the area left no room for manouver. It was almost as if security screening was an afterthought and jammed into the only space inadequate though it was. The airside shopping consisted two outlets for food and drink at the usual overinflated ""we have got you now so we will charge what we like"" prices and two retail outlets. There are four gates AB and C in one area and D all on its own. It was not overcrowded when we were there early afternoon but I can imagine it could be very claustrophobic at peak times. Pleasant staff and clean.",4,0
belfast-city-airport,Tony McLaughlin,United Kingdom,"This airport is going through a ""reconfiguaration"" and we are promised more seats more retail airside and quicker security. However what they don't need is EasyJet switching its LTN-BFS service to BHD from January 2010 with a promise of more services on the route and additional routes. I was none too amused today when a male member of staff wished to perform a random security check on my wife's handbag I felt she should have requested or should have been offered a female member of staff for this.",2,0
belfast-city-airport,I Jackson,United Kingdom,It only seems a couple of years ago that this new terminal was opened and now it's being rebuilt and extended - seems some bad planning. Arrival not too bad - luckily we were the only plane landing - but still took 15 mins for luggage. Departure currently a sham - as others say new drop off point a long walk from the terminal including crossing the main airport road. Into the terminal and prior to airside only a costa coffee - and many flights on this day check in opened only 60 mins prior to departure so a bit crowded and chaotic. Security queues painfully slow and airside overcrowded and uncomfortable. On ground level just a WHS small duty free and 2 cafes. Only 4 doors to gates and as budget airlines using airport watching the scum to get to plane reminds you of a third world airport. Only 2 small sets of toilets - the ladies was out of order at one and gents dirty. There is a cafe upstairs now that was a bit quieter - but very expensive - Â£1.75 for a small water. Belfast City airport used to be a joy to use - it's now reminds me of Luton and the other budget scrum airports but without the facilities.,1,0
belfast-city-airport,G Mulhern,United Kingdom,Have to agree with T McLaughlin comments re luggage reclaim at this airport - shocking to say the least. After a recent return flight from Gatwick I made a point of timing how long it took to reclaim luggage noticing it was significantly longer than anywhere else on previous occasions. I reached the luggage reclaim area at 1.47pm (time on reclaim screen) luggage only started coming out at 2.13pm - 26 mins later. Who is to blame here -is it Flybe or Belfast Airport.,4,0
belfast-city-airport,Andy Magowan,United Kingdom,As many have said this airport isn't helped by its size or by the fact the management seem intent on stretching the airport way beyond its comfortable operating capacity. Queues at security are generally between 10-15 minutes long with only 1 x ray machine working at any one time. The facilities are ok but not great and most of the staff seem thoroughly fed up! I think if Ryanair (and the customers it seems to attract hen & stag parties etc) were shifted on then there would be a much better atmosphere. As for food it seems that early in the morning a lot of the eateries aren't open the one I did go to was nice but way over priced. All in all it isn't a bad airport just let down I think by bad management decisions and cost cutting. It is certainly above Luton in most respects.,3,0
belfast-city-airport,Tony McLaughlin,United States,Small airport but anytime I disembark from a Heathrow flight it can take up to fifteen minutes for bags to reach the carousel. The bar on the first floor now appears to be closed which is a great shame as it was always quieter and more relaxing than the melee of the departures lounge. This airport goes from bad to worse.,2,0
belfast-city-airport,Derek Adams,,"It's almost impossible to downgrade this airport any further. The latest ""gouging"" of passengers of a £1 drop off charge is the final money grabbing insult (in the guise of ""passenger ""enhancements"") -consisting of a plastic sheeted walkway to the ""passenger collection point"" which turned out to be a tin hut without any seating a heater that wouldn't heat a rabbit hutch pitched several hundreds yards into a distant car park. Wet windy and feeling decidedly unwelcome particularly having travelled in-bound from Singapore (via LHR). Welcome to George Best City of Belfast Airport. Yes you really are welcome to it! Out-bound my driver was asked for a £1 drop off ""fee"" a few yards from the main entrance doors. He quite rightly refused to pay and I happily walked probably the most expensive 50 yards in the world! At security about 40 passengers queued to use the single x-ray machine (2 were not even turned on). Surly staff grunted at exasperated passengers without as much a courteous thank you or even the slightest suggestion of a smile. Possibly the smooth spin talking management could take their staff to (say) Singapore for a day to see how it can and is done! What a welcome to Ireland (North or South)!",1,0
belfast-city-airport,Tony McLaughlin,,I'm downgrading my opinion of this airport - services have expanded but the terminal has not - it is now very cramped airside and landside - I have heard today that the airport is now seeking planning permission for a 590m extension to the runway - more flights - more misery in the terminal.,2,0
belfast-city-airport,L Hamill,,I would agree with the comment that given BHD's recent route expansions and the arrival of Ryanair (groan!) the security queues are horrendous especially first thing in the morning and late afternoon. What used to be a compact business type airport is turning into a low-cost hub and with it come the world and his wife stag-weekenders - but the food upstairs land-side is very good in my experience (if pricey!),3,0
belfast-city-airport,Derek Adams,,The arrival of budget carrier Ryanair and the expansion of routes by existing carriers have pushed this once neat and friendly little airport way beyond its reasonable working capacity. The security screening area now has regular 30/40 minutes delays. Although equipped with three x-ray machines I have never seen more that two in operation and on many occasions only one in use. This airport is desperately in need of passenger area expansion and is looking decidedly tatty in many areas.,2,0
belfast-city-airport,D Peterson,,I am at a loss to understand the rave reviews given here. The airport is smallcrampedand the security (particularly first thing in the morning) a nightmare. I stood for almost 20 minutes at 0600 with no baggage having checked in online and as a result almost missed my flight. The choice of bar/restaurants is poor and the place has a feel of needing a good clean. The seats were hard and grubbythe taxi queue was long and when one was obtained turned out to be around £5 more expensive to go home than it did to arrive. The public transport is a joke(for trains) and the traffic on an evening can be hectic with the rush hour. I avoid this airport whenever possible,1,0
belfast-city-airport,Tony McLaughlin,,I agree with Mike Davies if you want to eat or drink at this airport do so landside upstairs (if you have enough time). It's just a short hop downstairs and through security to the departure gates. The airside bar and food areas are invariably very busy.,,0
belfast-city-airport,Mike Davies,,Nice small airport - Arrivals involved very little walking and even with baggage you can be out of ther terminal in about 10 minutes from getting off the plane. Car hire also simple and only a short walk to the carpark. When I departed at 6pm the airside lounge was very full with only a small bar with 8 tables - I had to do some work so I struggled. My advice - stay landside in the bar upstairs if you want some space then go through security nearer the time of your flight.,,0
belfast-city-airport,Don Whittle,,Belfast city airport far exceeds the limitations of it's more substantial neighbour at Templepatrick. It is easily accessed by road from North Down around and Belfast city itself. Why there is no rail station simply beggars belief. The rail track runs about 50 metres past its entrance so NIR or Translink should sort that out immediately. Facilities inside are clean and all plane departures are easy to get to.,,0
belfast-city-airport,Derek Adams,,All in all a neat and tidy regional Airport convenient to the City Centre but the trek to the Rail Link is somewhat exasperating-doubtless Northern Ireland Railways will move the station-when if ever they have the funding! Hopefully it will not over expand thereby keeping its' local and friendly position.,,0
belfast-city-airport,Matthew Ross,,I entirely agree with James Brown. The Belfast-Bangor commuter railway runs right past the airport but the new terminal is too far from Sydenham railway station. A new station for the airport is urgently needed.,,0
belfast-city-airport,James Brown,,The new terminal building is a vast improvement on the old shed (no really it was a shed...). Bright light airy and easy to find your way around. Definite premium feel - hence largely business passengers flying on full-service airlines such as BA and BMI. Some queries though - the space for security between land- and airside is cramped and passengers queue in the main entrance hall for this. And with the move from the old terminal (at the southern end of the airfield) the NIR rail station at Sydneham is now accessible only by requesting a shuttle bus and the bridge to it across the dual carriageway is not an attractive welcome for passengers continuing their journey with public transport. Surely a new rail station at the northern end of the car parking (where the rail line passes under the motorway and is back on the same side of the road as the terminal) would be a welcome investment?,,0
belfast-city-airport,Daniel Ng,,I use this airport to get down to London Heathrow every summer. The airport itself is very nice has the nice business touch so I feel awkward not wearing a business suit every time I go there. However the airport is very small with restaurants at level 2 with the main dining area looking out to the runaway. The boarding area which also have a small cafe and lots of seating which has smoking and non-smoking. A very quiet place-with little things to do with 1 or 2 arcade machines and your view of the runaway is seriously limited.,,0
belgrade-airport,Adrian Grigoriu,United Kingdom,Since the Etihad/Air Serbia flight from Abu Dhabi was late contrary to assurances we arrived in Belgrade ten minutes before our connection flight was to take off. The security staff at the x-ray checkpoint took their time though while the Air Serbia personnel at the flight gate in plain view were calling us to hurry as if the delays were our fault. They started by checking our duty free allowance and receipts then the hand luggage to check our watches and jewellery (we were moving back to Europe with all our belongings) and then had to wait another few minutes to have my shoes x-rayed. When we finally departed the clerk was still working our still screens. We flew from Sydney for 24 hours then. We have been re-checked in Abu Dhabi. We have just descended from the previous flight and we have been escorted to the checkpoint. What was there to check so thoroughly again? Since when were watches and jewellery a security point concern? Or was there an over zealous clerk on duty? Aren't there any clear instructions of what they are to check? If not we may be subjected at the discretion of a clerk to unnecessary and diminishing check-ups. In any case we decided not to use this route again.,,0
belgrade-airport,A Milossavlevich,Egypt,Indifferent check-in at Terminal 1 (charter and low cost terminal). Efficient and swift passport control. Mostly clean and easy to navigate. Recommended.,7,1
belgrade-airport,A Milossavlevich,Ukraine,Very efficient fast check-in and security clean. Major downsides - lack of a smoking room a post office and poor public transport links to the city - only two buses going to the center and New Belgrade other areas must be reached through connections at crowded hubs. New tablet-oriented website is a major disappointment unusable on mobiles unlike the previous version. All in all highly recommended and constantly improving besides random misses.,9,1
belgrade-airport,N Kutlesic,Serbia,Well Nikola Tesla airport is a small clean and peaceful airport in Belgrade. Very small compared to Heathrow Singapore Abu Dhabi etc. Plus - almost everything well organised check in waiting controls baggage claim everything is marked very good and it is as it should be enough space to stop in front of terminal doors and big parking. Minus- at baggage claim rude staff members. People didn't have nice approach down there they start yelling in Serbian it seems that they can't answer your questions nice and properly. Upstairs au contraire everyone is very polite. They really need to open some new shops.,8,1
belgrade-airport,A Jan,Australia,As Belgrade airport is coming into growth they are making an effort to improve and provide the same level of service that travelers expect in places like Singapore and Dubai. The airport was very quiet clean and well sign- posted in multiple languages our language did not take long (10-15 min) and the process through customs/immigration etc was very quick (we did arrive at 6am) the airport was very quiet and open planned. There seemed to be only one shop open at that early time. Arriving was smooth and effortless for those on the flight that I arrived on. Once through the gates there are many taxi drivers awaiting you the airport itself is very easy to navigate as it not that big when compared to Sydney or Abu Dhabi. The departure process seemed very hassle free the staff are friendly and helpful throughout the whole process the business class lounge is similar to all other destinations that I have been in and the facilities are in the process of being improved.,8,1
belgrade-airport,Peter Thackray,United Kingdom,"Arrived from Zurich with Swiss and landed at a gate. A short walk through the terminal (mixing with the outgoing passengers) and the Passport Control which quickly processed passengers with EU or Local Passports despite not actually being a member of the European Union. Good sized Baggage Reclaim and quick delivery of bags. Out past the usual Red/Green Channel and into the Arrivals which is at one end of the building. Note there is a small Bank just beyond the Customs before the doors to the outside Arrivals Hall so you can change money before getting caught up in the Arrivals Hall. Check-in is at the other end. Building updated in the last few years and is well signed in Serbian and English. There are the usual booths for Rental Cars and the like available. A Desk by the exit allows the ""booking"" of a taxi to specific destinations and fixed prices. The actual official taxis are outside across the drop-off road area. There are a lot of people offering taxi services within the terminal building. Check-in for return flights pretty smooth with Passport Control upstairs and Security Scanning at the individual gates. A reasonable selection of Duty Free shops and cafe airside. NB Serbian currency is a ""closed"" one so you must change back any money before going through passport control as everything is then priced in Euros and whilst they will take Serb Dinars there is nowhere to exchange them. Reasonable announcements about flights and short distances to walk to each gate. Note that some of the Departure/Arrival Screens don't have enough space to show all the flights as each code-share has its own line so one flight can fill half a screen.",9,1
belgrade-airport,A Milossavlyevich,Cyprus,Belgrade is now a busy transit airport in South Eastern Europe. The change has been massive for the last couple of years especially since the start of operations of Air Serbia. The airport is clean functional and rather well organized. The obvious downsides would be: lack of a smoking room (especially for transit passengers people smoking in the toilets) absence of a post-office that was closed some years ago the rude security personnel at the gates and the ventilation or a/c not working properly - it easily gets too hot within the gates and air-side of the terminal. Besides that it is a very good airport to travel to/from.,9,1
belgrade-airport,Peter Watson,United Kingdom,Nice and clean airport. Efficient. Changed rapidly last couple of years. Lot of new things added and opened. For sure best airport in this part of Europe.,10,1
belgrade-airport,C Negus,Switzerland,After a cancelled flight on Christmas eve which was only announced after 90 mins of delay without any in-between info - we were left stranded in the transit area for the night. Requests for a food voucher or a transit visa were treated with a shrug and a no. They only address you in Serbian and if you answer in English they continue in Serbian. The words 'Please' or 'Thank you' are missing from their vocabulary. It appears that the Air Serbia and Belgrade airport police are trying to show each other who is the boss all to the detriment of passengers. My advice: avoid.,,0
belgrade-airport,A Milossavlyevich,Turkey,BEG has changed a lot in the last couple of years. Check-in highly efficient security checks expeditious. Staff professional and courteous even friendly. The airport looks clean and spacious. Same on arrival luggage arriving quickly. For transportation to the city go to the departures floor for the bus 72. The only serious objection would be the absence of a smoking room and more recently of a post office (that was closed for unknown reasons). I would gladly use BEG again.,7,1
belgrade-airport,Uros Stanojevic,United States,The airport is very improved in comparison to last time. Last time I there was August 2012 and now in January 2013. It can be said that the airport has a modern look. Certain parts of the airport are still under construction but it works perfectly.,8,1
belgrade-airport,N Radojevic,Russian Federation,At arrival passport control and luggage delivery doesn't take longer than 10-15 minutes. Compact airport with easy to follow signage and layout. At departure level check in counters well staffed and provide quick and efficient service. Duty free shops are to be avoided since liquor and cosmetics items cost more than in city stores. A1 to A6 gates recently renewed and look very bright and modern. New reconstructed Business lounge is very spacious and provides a good selection of local / import beverages and a well stocked hot buffet is a nice touch. The transit area needs improvement and relocation since it is hidden away from general terminal traffic. Overall good improvements made; the current facility looks much brighter and better than what it 4-5 years ago!,9,1
belgrade-airport,A Milossavlyevich,Serbia,Clean and well-organised airport though the definitive downside being the excessive security measures. For a frequent traveller only at BEG do I have things confiscated almost every time I fly with not one of the agents or airport staff willing to find a solution. Last time I had 2kg of honey thrown away as it was considered as a dangerous substance by security staff. Just because of those attitudes and the hefty passenger taxes (20 EUR per ticket) I'll avoid flying out of Belgrade in the future.,3,1
belgrade-airport,R Ristic,United States,The airport check-in has greatly improved and the process is quick. The airport does need new restrooms in arrival area. This is not a luxury airport it is simple and basic. Taxis try to take advantage of travelers in all airports so upon arrival just call for a taxi to meet you outside.,8,1
belgrade-airport,P Courtine,United Kingdom,Arrived from Luton. Long queue at immigration and a long wait for luggage to arrive.

belgrade-airport,Ivan Markovic,Canada,Flight cancelled due to technical problem employees barely helped customer service wasn't good. It was +40 outside and the air conditioner did not work in the airport. I went in search of a bottle of water and walked for mile across the airport but all stores were closed and there were no facilities around. Facilities and shops are poor for a long wait.,1,0
belgrade-airport,Bill Hansen,Japan,Clean and well-designed airport. It does show age here and there but overall is well- maintained and convenient on both departure and arrival. Passport control did not take long luggage arrived extremely quickly but to be fair it seems only two flights had arrived simultaneously at that time (including mine). On departure check in was very quick gate easy to find. the only definite improvement that could've made things better would be either enlarging the waiting area in front of the gate or adding some facilities such as vending machine. There was a 2nd (and visibly less strict) security check at the entrace to the boarding gate waiting area which probably can be abolished and the waiting area joined to the main terminal area. Aircraft arrival/departure taxi times are very short since the airfield has a relatively simple layout.,4,0
belgrade-airport,Natasa Kostic,Australia,I find it very disturbing that after a long flight the first thing you see is the very grumpy face of the passport checking officer who cannot even be bothered to say hello. As far as departures go if you do not have a few euros to slip into the officers hand you are not going to get far. I understand that there is not enough funds to make the airport up to the European standards but a smile and good customer service will get you much further.,2,0
belgrade-airport,Dejan Petrovic,,Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport is getting better slowly but surely. Recent positive changes I noticed are that smoking is banned throughout the terminals except small designated area airside near gate A5 if I remember. Also I saw some WIFI points airside as well. More and more shops are added day by day but lack of proper decent restaurant is obvious thou they recently opened a self service one near A4 which seems really nice. Departure terminal 2 and arrival hall look spacious bright and modern. What needs urgent renovation are transfer desk and airside paths and waiting rooms all the way from A1-A8 as they were used even during the renovation process thus look really worn and do not match the rest of the renovated terminal 2.,3,0
belgrade-airport,Brandon Sumpter,,I have used Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport three times so far and satisfied with it. Maybe my expectations were low to start with but the airport is clean spacious (for its size) and the staff is friendly. What I dont like is lack of a real restaurant with the real menu. From what I understand they are planing further expansion and adding more 'activities'.,4,0
belgrade-airport,S Obrenovic,,Having no other Intl airport I arrive and depart through Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport (Nikola Tesla Intl. Airport). I would restrict my comments to taxis. It is way too bad even for us Serbs and I can only imagine how it is for foreigners. many times while waiting for a friend to pick me I had to guide a foreigner through the process to avoid being ripped off by semi-legal taxi drivers. To avoid being ripped off for foreigners it is maybe the best to either have someone pick you or to call national taxi to pick you as soon as you land so that they can arrive from the city by the time you pick your baggage.,3,0
belgrade-airport,Dragan Grujic,,Totally agree with M Scott but would like to add that annoying thing is that coffee shop did not accept Euros only Serbian Dinar - still can't believe I couldn't buy newspapers airside. The good thing is kids room where kids can play and leather lounges are very confortable.,3,0
belgrade-airport,M Scott,,The airport looks modern and clean but its facilities are very poor particularly airside. There is nowhere to buy a newspaper or magazine few places to eat and even fewer places to sit. Perhaps it's an attempt to make you spend time in the duty-free shops which are well- stocked but charge rip-off prices for everything (two or three times what a supermarket in the UK would charge). Smoking is permitted in the terminal building and it can be difficult to find a place to sit or eat that is not smoky. Public transport to and from the city is limited to a single bus once an hour (on the hour taking about 40 minutes in each direction). My advice would be to check in online where possible and spend as little time in this aiport as you can.,2,0
belgrade-airport,Alex Inacio,,"Used the airport this morning on BA to Heathrow. The main gripe I had was the lack of an airside currency exchange counter. There is an exchange on the ground floor by the check-in desks and one upstairs in the Raffiesen Bank by passport control but I decided to keep my local currency for a bit of shopping on the other side of immigration. However there is only an automatic exchange machine which wasn't working. The lady at the information desk agreed that it doesn't make sense not to have one airside. I think the duty free shop does accept Euros but the smaller shops and the cafes do not. The other main omission was no proper restaurant facilities. There were a number of cafes which served sandwiches cakes and other snacks but no ""restaurant"". Aside from those points it was an acceptable airport for its type.",3,0
belgrade-airport,Mathias Schaefer,,I was in Belgrade in October. The airport is very clean and staff very friendly. It's a little bit small but there is a very good bus connection to the city. Also there are enough taxi cars and you can rent a car too. I wish this airport will be expanded.,4,0
belgrade-airport,Doug Raynes,,Smart modern looking airport but poor facilities for shopping eating and drinking. What's more many of the shops were closed - and this in the middle of the day. My advice is not to go to departures too early and certainly do not go to the gate (and security) until the last minute or you will be stuck in a drab room with little seating and no facilities at all. You need to get rid of Serbian currency before leaving the country because you can't get it exchanged outside Serbia but there are no exchange facilities at the airport! Presumably this is to ensure that people spend any excess money at the airport.,2,0
belgrade-airport,B Patel,,I use Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport from time-to-time. I am pleased about the new minibus service that takes passengers to major hotels in the city (Hyatt Continental and Slavia). Duty Free shopping has improved but is still not up to the standards of its counterparts in Prague and Budapest a new fashion store Serbian souvenir store and expanded duty free store are currently on offer to passengers. However ground and immigration staff still need to improve on customer service and must give away their old mentality of having coffee breaks every hour. Despite the improvements I will only award it with 3 stars.,3,0
belgrade-airport,Francesco Lulli,,I used Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport for the first time since my last visit in 2004. The arrival hall and the whole airside area haven't changed much but the new departure terminal (which is actually an extension to the old building) is nice. I have never had a problem with Serbian immigration and also this time it was totally painless and fast. What I did not like were the illegal cab drivers lurking around the arrival hall and the bus stop outside I had a hard time getting rid of them while waiting for the Jat bus; this seems to be a problem only on the lower level when you exit customs if you walk one floor up to the main taxi line things seem much improved; I think the airport management should definitely do something to solve the cab mafia issue permanently.,3,0
belgrade-airport,Morten Jørgensen,,"Airport is looking better now after reconstruction but smoking should be restricted on smoking areas signs ""NO SMOKING"" should be more visible. Airport staff need to learn more about service and polite passenger handling especially passport control stuff. Area is missing some quality restaurants and more tax free shops. Time table for bus connections to the town Belgrade and other major cities should be available on web site as well as at information desk.",,0
belgrade-airport,Martin Faulkner,,"After experiencing a 6-hour delay here recently on a flight to LHR with British Airways (incoming flight forced to turn back en route due to technical fault followed by a changeover to a different machine) I have mixed experiences of Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport. The recent renovation has clearly worked wonders at least compared with previous reviews; the seats are reasonably comfortable food and drink is available to an adequate extent and the air is even fairly breathable compared with the rest of Serbia (at least until you get within 100 metres of one of the designated smoking areas); on the other hand the thoroughly intimidating security and passport control staff will make you feel guilty for having even the slightest scrap of local currency left on you by the time you're airside and if you do suffer an extensive delay then you can expect to endure the Serbian concept of ""information"" - i.e. repeatedly extending the ETA of the incoming plane then claiming that the estimated departure is in fact the time ""at which more information will be provided"" said information turning out to be that... more information will be provided in an hour's time. By the end of it all I felt not only thoroughly drained but thoroughly sorry for the BA representative an efficient young man who was clearly only trying to do his best in an all-encompassing fug of misinformation and customer anger. Nevertheless I can't help thinking that better complimentary food/drink could have been provided than at the optimistically named ""Boeing"" café where a dry sandwich swiftly imported from landside and a soft drink were supposed to sustain us for a quarter of a day. Needless to say obtaining a Serbian beer at BA's expense was out of the question despite the fact that the decidedly passable local brew actually cost less than the Coca-Cola the overworked chef-cum-waiter had been authorised to dole out en masse. Still as extensive delays go one of the more uneventful I've experienced - which I think serves as roundabout praise for the new airport!",,0
belgrade-airport,Christian Claussen,,The airport is now almost up-to-date in both arrival and departure hall. Looks spacious and modern. Note - if you wish to exchange money there is place to do this in the arrival hall - you must take the escalator up to departure hall. JAT airport bus leaves to city centre every hour - ie 20.00 21.00.,,0
belgrade-airport,Stevan Bulat,,Newly remodeled international terminal is functional and being used for the past 3 weeks and it looks great. It is clean spacious and has modern monitors placed above check in lines and elsewhere. There are quite a few souvenir shops past the passport control to choose from with some interesting Serbian souvenirs. Prices are higher than in the city but affordable for tourists and that is to be expected of any airport shop. Everyone I dealt with was professional and I am glad to see the improvements. The air plane museum is a worthwhile stop only about 500m from the airport and while the building is showing its age it does house some rare planes to be seen.,,0
belgrade-airport,Christian Claussen,,Travelled through late summer; apparently under construction - but did not see any kind of activity. Picked the wrong taxi driver to city - bad guy of course despite wearing an official looking badge. One week later I arrived from Montenegro and went straight to the curb outside and picked a taxi which was unloading passengers - no problem (just make sure they blue sign on the roof with a 4 digit no). Flying out of Belgrade the change office quoted a very bad price for the rest of my dinars so I chose to keep them. Few options for shopping duty free - saw several closed of shops some still displaying articles!,,0
belgrade-airport,R Rasmussen,,The international terminal is still in construction so the old domestic terminal is used. Everything went smooth both arrival and departure. No hassle. Extra plus for sufficient smokers sections. Tax free shops with very few articles.,,0
belgrade-airport,Ben Lai,,"I was in Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport 15 and 18th of Oct. I saw no improvement made highlighted by the others in the report. Sad looking airport poor service at the business lounge custom officials that try hard to get ""something"" out of you. The only highlight is the air museum 500m away from the airport. If you are a aircraft freak especially Soviet models that's will be a heaven for you. Otherwise the best thing about Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport is flight out of it.",,0
belgrade-airport,Stephen Lin,,Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport is currently modernising but it is reasonably good at the moment new airlines like Tunisair Snowflake and Uzbekistan Airways have opened up routes to there. It is supposed to turn into the logistic centre for the Balkans and it is the largest airport in the Balkans (ex. Athens).,,0
belgrade-airport,D Radic,,So - what have happened with the update of International part of the terminal building? It is obviously still ongoing process that causes horrible feeling in this gloomy airport! Not to mention the amount of smoke inhaled in that sad-looking bar on the first floor.,,0
belgrade-airport,Dejan Markovic,,Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport is undergoing heavy expansion and reconstruction works which are scheduled to be finished by May 2004. Because of this the International Terminal has been closed and all passengers have been re-routed to the Domestic Terminal which was 'adapted' to handle International traffic. This was done in a less than perfect way which makes the airport look really bad. First off all the Domestic terminal was built in the early 60s and has never undergone works to 'update it'. It is much smaller than the International counterpart (built in the early 80s) which expands on three floors. Hopefully when the airport re-opens in late spring thing will go much smoother. In the meantime airport officilas should display some 'Sorry for the inconvenience' and explanation signs.,,0
belgrade-airport,Ian Ackermann,,Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport is a true time warp - it's like a small journey back to 1960's (behind the iron curtain!). The airport facilities are poor and not well maintained there is only one overpriced restaurant duty free shops are not well stocked (i.e. no malt whiskeys and no Marlboros!) and there is no internet connection available. If you couple this with the fact that it is one of the most disorganized airports I have ever seen in my life (only 3 check-in counters for ALL Yugoslav Airlines international flights with almost no distinction between business class and economy class check in then one can only imagine what kind of a mess it was) and with very rude staff makes it one of the worst airport experiences I ever had. If you ever travel there make sure that there is someone waiting for you because taxis available there will rip you off. Do not even think about buses because they look like they had leased them from a museum. However I must say that some things are improving and I hope that they will finally put their act together and make it comparable with other Central European airports.,,0
belgrade-airport,Luka Popovic,,Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport is a small airport. From 1990 to 2000 the country was in terrible condition as well as the airport. But now it is turning in to a world airport. On level one of the airport as well as on level number two there are duty frees and shops. The ground staff is very friendly. I just hope the airport expends even more.,,0
belize-airport,K Gates,United States,Small minimal facilities not much to do while you wait. Staff are friendly and efficient. The day we arrived there was live music playing in the customs area - nice touch! We walked out of the terminal to be greeted immediately by our tour arranger.,7,1
belize-airport,Gerald Preis,,My trip to Belize took me through BZE 3 times. It is a classic sleepy 2-room airport: an updated arrivals hall with a mechanical carousel a communal departure area serving the 4 or 6 gates (glass doors really) that lead to the tarmac separated by the small warm somewhat chaotic check-in area. Some staff were friendly and enthusiastic security checks were minimal. Few large jets come to BZE but they do seem to be timed near each other. Most flights are prop planes to the interior and the offshore reefs. There is a pleasant open air deck that allows views of arriving and departing passengers walking to and from their planes. There is nothing else to do while waiting for your flight. Bring a book. Amenities are few: tiny gifts shops snack bars and a cafeteria. A good place to people watch. Very stress-free and it serves its purpose. Ambergris Cay was our real destination. Well worth the trip!,,0
belo-horizonte-confins-airport,Joaquim Coelho,Brazil,"I flew a couple of times this year into Belo Horizonte's Confins International airport and I must say that this airport lacks the basics. It was supposed to be renovated for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and a few weeks before the tournament the airport was in utter chaos. It seemed as if I was in a construction sight. I came back during the World Cup and things improved a little giving it a more pleasant atmosphere. I am Brazilian so the language is not a problem but I spoke with some people that passed through the airport and they complained how few people spoke English. The airport does not receive many international flights. Only flights are to Buenos Aires-Argentina Miami-USA Lisboa-Portugal and Panama City-Panama and only a few of those are daily. Most of the times I arrived to this airport were on domestic flights but in July I came from the USA using a Copa Airlines flight from Panama City. I was puzzled as to why the plane did not parked directly at the gate since it arrived early in the morning and there were many finger gates with no planes parked whatsoever. Immigration officials were not friendly and showed little professionalism the lady that checked my passport had one earphone on and was chewing gum with her mouth open. The luggage carrousel is a complete mess as the area is very cramped and small. Customs was the only positive as once I had my luggage I went through it quickly. This airport has very bad air conditioning and in the summer it can be horribly hot inside and having to wait to board with very little seating can be a hassle. It is really far from downtown Belo Horizonte but the roads are good and I recommend taking the ""Conexão Aeroporto"" buses that take you straight to the center of the city for a rate of R$ 21 (around 10 dollars). This option is very advantageous because taking a cab directly from the airport is ridiculously expensive. Have seen worse airports but this one is one that I am certainly not very fond of. Does it's job but could be far off better and I hope it does get better once the renovations are finished.",4,0
belo-horizonte-confins-airport,N Junzo,Brazil,Confins looks like a bus station rather than an international airport. Poor services bad signage extremely high prices and depressing overcrowded waiting areas close to the boarding gates. Catering and shopping options inside security area are very limited so make sure to replenish yourselves before proceeding to it.,5,0
belo-horizonte-confins-airport,Y Bert,Switzerland,I haven't seen much progress the airport still looks quite old. The prices of food and drinks are extremely high compared to prices in Belo Horizonte and the public transportation (buses) to Belo Horizonte aren't efficient for an airport aiming to be international. Good points : waiting times aren't too long and free parking facilities just in front of the terminal.,3,0
belo-horizonte-confins-airport,Antonio Ferreira,Brazil,"The new ""linha verde"" - green line was a very good improvement in this airport access; all the journey now takes about 35 minutes in express way. Even with more and more passengers increase month a month it's still lacking international 3 cities (Miami Lisbon and Panama City) are directly connected. The baggage claim is a problem: only 1 is located in international area (and is very small and you must wait a lot of time until you get your baggage).",3,0
belo-horizonte-confins-airport,A Hijmans,Brazil,"One of Brazil's better airports although its design is stark and gloomy - though airy. Used aforementioned ""Conexio Aeroporto"" bus service to get there: punctual fast and good quality. Food wise all the usual airport restaurants are here but on the third floor to the left is a real find if you want real food and you're on a budget: the Restaurante Social looks like a university canteen but serves palatable food at non-airport prices.",4,0
belo-horizonte-confins-airport,A Hetier,,"I concur with the comment below Confins is under-used. But there is a big plus: ""Conexao Aeroporto"" buses that take you to the city centre are punctual and efficient.

belo-horizonte-confins-airport,Andre Bomtempo,,The new Highway (Linha Verde) connecting the Airport to Downtown Belo Horizonte will definitely help with the distance issue. The Airport itself is modern and well maintained. But I think it has potential that’s not being used. The lack of international flights is another problem. Most flights have connections in Rio or SP making BH hours farther then it really is. It could take less than 10 hours from New York but with the connections it takes about 15 hours if we are lucky enough to find a flight from Rio or SP. Hopefully with the “Industrial Airport” more international flights will start to be available we’ll see.,,0
belo-horizonte-confins-airport,Giovanni Guidi,,Very badly located and designed airport. The check-in areas are outside (it doesn't rain but it can be very hot) the airport is too far away from the city (no fast connections as well). In terms of services it has banks restaurants newsagents cash machines and a post office. There is no internet access for passengers which is ridiculous for the third biggest airport in Brazil. I had to send an urgent business email and had to beg the local administration office (on the top floor of the terminal) to use one of their computers for 5 minutes. Thanks to the good nature of most of the Brazilian people this was allowed (saving me from a lot of problems) but if the management is willing to put mobile phones rechargers in the terminal (I could see they were available for everyone for free) they could also make the effort to put a couple of internet access points.,,0
belo-horizonte-confins-airport,Andrew Coogans,,Confins is a modern easy to use airport. It seems a little underused though. The check in areas are very close to the drop off point for cars. Restaurants and bars typical for a Brasilian airport. Nothing too special. Gate areas have very comfortable chairs but they appear to be getting replaced by more standard hard ones. The problem with Confins as most people in Belo Horizonte know is its distance from the city centre. 1 hour away on a non-motorway standard road.,,0
benghazi-airport,Peter Thackray,United Kingdom,"Flew from Tripoli to Benghazi. Extremely small airport but very speedy. Bus from aircraft to Arrivals ""Shed"" which was about 300m from the plane. A single Baggage Reclaim Belt that was open to anyone from arriving passengers to well-wishers and anyone else. No obvious security but a couple of guards. Departures domestically was a similar affair with a perfunctory scan of hand luggage and a check of Boarding Pass which then had to receive a Stamp from another person before being lead into a seating area with a small place selling drinks and snacks and toilet and Prayer Room. Boarding was females first then male passengers by bus to the plane waiting on the tarmac. Very few aircraft movements so departure was as soon as boarding was completed.",3,0
bergen-airport,A Tønnesen,Norway,Arrived from Alicante 7th December plane landed 01.35. We had to wait 1 hour 10 minutes for our luggage. No announcements given. When conveyor belt finally started the screens did not indicate from which flight and there was a lot of confusion.,1,0
bergen-airport,Paul Jacobsen,,Connected through BGO on my way back to Sweden. Transit was hassle-free with short walking distances good signage and friendly staff. The major downside is the lack of seating areas. On a Sunday afternoon the domestic side was overcrowded with passengers standing everywhere. To reach the few international gates you must pass through a fairly well-supplied duty-free shop; but then there is only a small café and again very few seating areas.,3,0
bergen-airport,Sasun Vartanyan,,A pleasant little airport. Do not expect a lot but the relaxing leather chairs in the lounges facing the tarmac are extra bonus. Of course very polite staff.,4,0
bergen-airport,David Pincombe,,We travelled through Bergen airport en route for the Norwegian Coastal Voyage in June 2006.

bergen-airport,James O'Brien,,I have used Bergen Airport many time due to business. I am impressed with this airport. Ok it allot smaller than OSL and always seems to be quiet. The check in hall is very good I always fly Braathen in and out of this airport. The domestic baggage hall does give me some alarm for concern - it is the same as you would see in the USA anybody can just come in off the street and swipe your bag. Security for departing passengers is very strict as it is in all norwegian airports. Staff here are always friendly and jolly. One of the best airports in the world.,,0
bergerac-airport,Michael Souter,United Kingdom,I was looking forward to using Bergerac Airport for the first time. But the experience was dreadful. I thought it would be much quicker to check in and go through security. But it was the worst airport I have experienced. There was only one person most of the time checking in the flight who was spending a ridiculous amount of time in each passenger. As a frequent flyer I know of no other airport where every single carry on bag is checked in. Security is over zealous checking in more detail than any other airport I have ever visited. It was a horrible experience which spoilt my visit to the Dordogne.,2,0
bergerac-airport,Richard Lindsay,United Kingdom,This airport is small so whilst access is good facilities are very limited. Airside there are only 2-3 vending machine so if you want anything to eat or drink best use the bar Landside. Do not carry tins (eg Duck Confit Pate etc) that are greater than 100g in hand luggage - they will be confiscated at security.,5,1
bergerac-airport,S Gaudicheau,,Arrival was great. I was at passport control within 2 minutes of landing. On the way back it was another story. I couldn't do the online check in and I found out at the airport that it's not provided when you fly from Bergerac. You have to queue with everybody in order to get your boarding pass even if you only have hand luggage. Ground personnel very slow until the call was made to invite people for boarding. They then suddenly were very quick. The toilets aren't provided with coat or handbag hangers which I find not practical.,3,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,Howard Barker,United Kingdom,No change here and still virtually no seating past security. Hot and sticky on a warm day. A door had been opened to provide air conditioning. Tantalising views of the new airport as they were using one of its runways due to maintenance causing a very long taxi to and from the stands.,6,1
berlin-schonefeld-airport,T Kavanagh,United Kingdom,This airport is seriously unpleasant we experienced a very lengthy queue at the absurd baggage screening before you check in yes before you check in! Another lengthy queue to check in then another lengthy queue for security then a long walk to the gate. A very unattractive airport with inadequate seating and poor facilities. This was my first encounter with Berlin Schonefeld and certainly my last as I will never fly to or from this airport again.,,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,C Godwin,United Kingdom,After reading other reviews it appears I am not alone. Definitely the worst airport I have experienced. The facilities are shocking. Staff are simply rude. I am sitting in a cafe called Marche. Seems clean enough but check out the ceiling space above the food prep area. All that is landing in your food! The owners / operators of this place should be ashamed.,,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,I Dra,France,I guess their way of solving the lack of facilities is not to allow people in sooner than 2 hours before the flight which by the way I haven't seen published. On their site on boarding passes anywhere. It's ridiculous I had a VIP lounge pass which I couldn't use because the lounge was airside so I couldn't get to it. I had to wait outside where the seating is also lacking and the smell of food nauseating. It's a disgrace for a capital like Berlin. German people should be ashamed of such an airport. They are not able to have a decent airport built the new one is expected to be finished in 2017!,,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,K Tweedale,United Kingdom,Just returned from five day trip to Berlin and once again flew through this deplorable airport. Have been here several times but continue to be amazed at this dump. Slow check-in (an hour) slow security (over 45 minutes you have been warned!). If you are infirm disabled elderly have children etc. you will find long walks no lifts all the seating areas full dirty toilets horrible food. Oh yes the duty-free areas are clean modern well-lit and welcoming. Don't let this fool you. It is the only place in this black hole that is. Would it be so much to expect a few extra cheap plastic seats so that you don't have to sit on the floor? Is it even possible for the ceiling fans to be operational and they are there because I have seen them to be used so that the departure gates aren't unbearably hot even in winter? Oh yes and once you make your way to/from the trains you have another long walk outside up and down ramps no lifts no escalators. Nothing ever changes here so I don't imagine anyone reads any of these reviews and if they do they have a good laugh because they are sadists. They must be to allow the state of things at this so-called airport to continue. Give this a wide berth if at all possible. As for the managers/owners of this airport and all the airlines using it you should be ashamed of yourselves.,,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,N Stapleton,Ireland,This is quite possibly the worst airport I have ever used. On arrival in the airport there was a strong sewage smell on the apron. The police officers at passport control were wordless and unsmiling (although on the return flight from Berlin this was different). The toilets in arrivals were very small dirty and there was an overpowering smell (not a pleasant one). On a positive note you do get out of the airport very quickly as it is so small. For the return flight the check in queue did not move for ages. The airside/shopping area was cramped and far too hot. There was far too many people in this area considering the size of the airport. The airport is clearly not intended for this amount of passengers as there is very little seating areas so most people had to sit on the floor. The new Brandenburg airport is much needed!,1,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,Rob Alford,United Kingdom,Woefully poor airport. Echo the comments elsewhere that there's really inadequate seating long queues through security but the worst bit easily is the lack of lifts/ escalators everything is designed here that you're able to walk! So forget it if you've got a buggy or you're in a wheelchair! Staff couldn't care less. Airport is like a shed. The exception being of course the duty free shop where it seems no expense has been spared to get you to part with your cash! I know the budget airlines fly from here and this airport will be defunct when the new combined Berlin airport is built but it's really at the cheap end of cheap!,,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,John Kenny,United Kingdom,Just back on easyjet from SXF. Awful place about 20 minute wait for passport control on arrival in basically a shed. Long walk up and downstairs to baggage reclaim with queue for gents toilet totally inadequate. Departure just as bad with crowded cramped security area and not enough seating in departures. Getting to gate 62 was a nightmare with massive bottleneck of people trying to get downstairs to farthest gates. Not for the faint hearted!,4,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,Peter Cullen,United Kingdom,The sooner it closes the better it is a far cry from other German airports I have encountered which are least efficient. Arriving involved a 20 minute wait for passport checks despite being the only recently arriving flight as far as I could tell. The walk to the U-bahn is lengthy though the train into the centre is good value and fairly quick. Leaving was worse; having joined a very slow moving queue in Terminal B we were advised to go to A as 'there are no queues there'. Wrong there was a short queue for initial luggage scanning but we then joined a very slow queue (over 20 minutes) for secondary screening. This was entirely down to one scanner out of four available being used despite several staff standing around chatting. As we reached the head of the queue they started a second luggage scanner but it made very little difference as everyone had to go through one body scanner and almost everybody seemed to set it off. Once through the facilities are basic and very tatty. The final insult is that as the aircraft taxies out it passes the large and brand new terminals for Brandenburg - all completely unused.,3,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,C Pike,United Kingdom,"On Sunday 28th I had the dubious pleasure of a flight from Terminal D. The facilities before check-in were limited but on passing through to the departure lounge things did deteriorate. Although there was no obvious dirt the ladies toilets smelt. As for the catering facilities - a latte consisted of 3/4 cup of froth 1/4 coffee. As for the wrap which were declared to be ""freshly made"" - stale is not an adequate description they were rock hard and inedible. Most unpleasant - ensure you have used toilet facilities and had refreshments before you reach the airport!",2,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,Howard Barker,United Kingdom,Terminal B. The lack of seating past check-in and need to stand around the shopping areas until the departure gate is ready has been mentioned by others; however I meant to add in my last review that it is fairly compact so there is no need to proceed beyond check-in until nearer departure time. The entrance to the security area is visible from check-in so you can check the queuing time. In early June a new security line was being built suggesting that Brandenburg International won't be opening any time soon.,5,1
berlin-schonefeld-airport,Z Mamon,United Kingdom,Grim place. Arrived earlier than our check in time and there was nowhere to sit except in the lone eatery. Washrooms on the ground floor were dirty smelly and no toilet paper. Before check in each piece of luggage has to be security checked - this was particularly difficult for us as we are quite elderly. Once past check in and security one enters a long corridor with some shops and eateries. One of the fresh sandwich bars looked good. Again seating is very limited. Hectic scene as travellers were making their way down the corridors to their respective gates. On the plus side a walk to the furthest gate is less than 10 minutes and wifi is free. A flight delay at this airport would be most painful.,,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,P Miller,United Kingdom,This is quite possibly the worst airport I have ever experienced. It's built for another era and certainly cannot cope with the level of traffic passing through it these days. Wen you arrive before you can even get to check-in you have to queue to put all your luggage (hold and cabin) through a scanner - there were just two machines but even one of those was not operational. Then you choose: if you have bags to check then join that queue; if not then go straight to the absurdly long line (I estimated 150 people in front of us) to have your boarding pass checked - by just one person. Then it's the second security check. Then you're through! But wait you're going to London so there's another queue in a sterile corridor for passport control (one person again) before you get to your gate where your passport is checked again. This whole process took just over 1 hour - at 0600. Sorry EasyJet but I'm never coming here again.,1,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,A Watson,United Kingdom,"I have travelled around the world and flown in and out of some pretty shoddy airports but this takes the cake! Its obvious that all the money has been ploughed into Brandenburg and that no maintenance will be carried out this place. Even the ""Executive Lounge"" is a small box upstairs. nothing special at all. An uncomfortable experience not to be repeated.",1,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,D Stanton,United Kingdom,One of the worst airports in Europe I have had to use. Overcrowded lack of seating dirty toilets disgusting both in arrival and departure areas. In the arrival terminal the train ticket machines were not working so to get train tickets you have to queue at a stand with only one overworked person serving. Facilities throughout totally inadequate. If you do and you get the train into Berlin the train doesn't get any better. The one that we were on was dirty and had seen better days. We liked Berlin but wouldn't travel through this airport again.,,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,J Howard,United Kingdom,I have vowed never to fly to this airport again! Hardly any seating for people once you're through Security - this really is unacceptable as most of the space is given over to retail rather than to the comfort of the passengers. As a previous reviewer said it must be hell on earth if you're delayed! Noisy cramped uncomfortable!,,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,A Conway,Ireland,Travelled through it last night and each time (as a frequent flyer) it amazes me how cramped inefficient and inadequate this airport is. Inadequate seating - people sitting on stairs and on the floor whereas most wall space is offered to retail. Security could be more efficient and organised. I would really hate to be in this airport in the event of a delay! Toilets were also broken - they were being repaired when I went in to use them maintenance please on an ongoing basis would sort this out.,3,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,Howard Barker,United Kingdom,Had expected to arrive at the new Brandenburg International airport on its fourth day open however it didn't so Schonefeld is still in use. It is small enough so no long walks. Facilities are limited. Passport check quick and bags waiting. Departing from Terminal B there is virtually no seating after security unacceptable and not enough at the gates. Passport control is just before the departure gate so a queue blocking the corridor you don't know whether to wait here or if your departure gate is further. There is also the lengthy walk to the station and no longer a bus shuttle. Overall fit for purpose there are many much worse but I look forward to Brandenburg.,6,1
berlin-schonefeld-airport,T Zulan,Germany,This is by far the worst German Airport I have ever travelled through. There is not enough waiting room to wait for the check-in to open. The queue for security is not sufficient. The actual terminals are announced only when boarding begins. There is not enough waiting room. Boarding is actually a two stage process where there is not enough space to queue and not enough room while you wait to walk to your plane. The airport completely lacks any useful concept of how to handle a significant amount of people. I'm not talking of a minor capacity issue during peak times. I'm talking about 20 seats for 200 people who have to wait hours! In addition to these fundamental issues the airport is dirty everywhere. It's ugly. The food options (at least outside of security) are terrible. Yet you have to walk though (not besides) duty-free shops. At least the staff weren't unfriendly but not especially helpful or friendly either. BTW: They told me to be there 2:30 hrs before take-off the checking actually only opens 2:00 hours before.,1,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,N von Massow,United Kingdom,Nowhere to sit before departure after security because all space is dedicated to retail. People were sitting on the floors in hallways staircases etc. Using Schönefeld approx 3x per year and it's the same situation each time. Staff are rude at Security. Making an already unpleasant experience even more uncomfortable.,1,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,F Odds,United Kingdom,This small airport is intended to become the sole airport serving Berlin as part of new Berlin Brandenburg International development plan. At present it serves only the cut-price cattle-herding airlines. For a modest operation it really isn't as bad as some reviews here make out. The arrivals hall was compact and it was easy to find the sort of things you need on arrival - bank machines travel information and so on. Departing through Schonefeld my flight was delayed by 5 hours which offered a lot of opportunity to experience the airport! It lacked enough seating landside to cope with two seriously delayed flights but there were reasonable facilities otherwise: indeed the best restaurant offered an excellent breakfast buffet for â‚¬11. Airside once again there was insufficient seating (the airport is designed as a shopping mall with optional access to aeroplanes in the currently fashionable style). The seating shortage was particularly unreasonable at the departure gates where people know they need to assemble en masse if they're flying with an airline that offers no seat allocations. Being able to sit and rest before the stampede for the steps is announced is an important component of the 'low cost' (it really isn't any more) flying experience.,3,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,S Erich,,Slow slower the slowest - you have plenty of time after arrival to go to the toilet or make a few phone calls prior to your luggage finally arriving in the baggage claims area - airport is uninspiring with below average food outlets. Access via public transport is lousy and in order to make more money they moved the airport from the B-zone to the C-zone in the public transportation map. So now you pay more for your ticket but have less trains running due to the S-Bahn in Berlin having technical difficulties. Also late at night and especially on weekends you find lots of young drunken people and hooligans on these trains - no safety staff there. Taxis cost a lot especially if you need to go to city center west or the north. TXL is much better with public transport. SXF is only advised if someone with a car gets you there or picks you up!,2,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,M Dixon,,Airport fine arrival and departure very quick and efficient. Transport to city centre in terms of cost and efficiency puts British airports to shame. The whole thing is best described as cheap and cheerful set up for budget airlines where you don't expect passengers to be sat in restaurants and browsing round designer shops for hours. Found all the staff polite and helpful.,3,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,C Nedo,,"Schönefeld (SXF) is annoying. First it's far away from the city staff are unfriendly. Security whistles at people to come over here rude if you don't speak German very inflexible concerning something out of their rule-set (e.g. I had the liquids in two plastic bags within each other - so one plastic bag stuffed into the other. the outer one was regular size. that was not possible - ""only one plastic bag allowed""). Processes are sometimes idiotic at the airport. Walks are very long and with lots of stairs up and down. food is relatively expensive.",2,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,Charles Scott,,Flew into SXF from GLA on easyjet going in long line at immigration seemed the computer was running slow fair walk after immigration to baggage claim  part of it in a cold passageway  open to the outside baggage waiting when we got to baggage claim. As previously stated very little seating landside in terminal A some in the snack bar near the check in area interestingly hold baggage is xrayed before you get to the check in desks. Through security fairly quick given the large number of staff manning the scanners. Lagre duty free shop a small bookstall and another shop selling souvenirs confectionary wine and foodstuffs - and about 10 or so seats though a few more seats in the Kilkenny Pub which oddly you have to pass through to get to Easyjet gates.,3,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,Daniel Sachse,,"Good and cheap public transport connections (Regional trains metro ""S-Bahn"" and busses all at regular fare) easy to navigate helpful staff. Contra: Both check-in and arrival are rather small and become very crowded in rush times. Way too few seating arrangements. Terminals lack all elegance the atmosphere is that of a bus station or your average IKEA. All in all the airport is cheap in all it's good and bad respects but serves its task efficiently.",3,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,David Griffiths,,A slightly odd experience but much better than some of the other comments on this site led me to expect. Anyone who is looking for the facilities you find at major German Airports like HAM or CGN (let alone MUC) is in for a serious disappointment but take SFX for what it is - a former communist airfield smartened up to deal predominantly with low cost airlines - and it really isn't bad at all. Seating is definitely an issue both in the Terminal A lounge area and at the departure gates. Like some of the other reviewers I wouldn't fancy being delayed here. On the other hand I found the security and airline staff friendly and efficient although unfortunately the same cannot be said for the passport control officers who were checking outbound passengers at the entrance to Gate 65 when I departed. For access to central Berlin it's better to use the faster RB/RE trains rather than the S Bahn - the cost is the same but there are far fewer stops and it's only 20 minutes to Alexanderplatz or 30 minutes to the Hbf.,3,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,Darren McCormac,,I use SXF regularly and it does what an airport is meant to do and no more. It's relatively efficient though passenger comfort levels could be increased so that the airside section can cope with delays and cancellations. A tip for the train station - there are two BVG and one DB ticket machines in the main terminal and there are at least two further machines on the S-Bahn platforms in addition to the machines in the walkway.,4,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,N Fitzgerald,,Considering his airport is now handling more flights than it did during the DDR days it copes very well. The staff - many ex-Interflug employees - are very polite and friendly. Although the walk to the S-Bahn is lengthy and requires a few sets of stairs and uncovered portions at least it has an efficient and convenient link to the centre of Berlin - obviously a throwback to the old days when public transportation was actually encouraged. Having said that the car park provides ample parking and is a great place to pick-up and return rental cars. My only disappointment is that the history of the airport - and especially Interflug is no where to be seen I really hope this may be considered in the design of the new BBI.,4,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,Iain Leitch,,A pleasant experience helped no doubt by on time arrival and return departure with hand luggage only. On arrival plenty of ticket machines for train in terminal / train station - only snag was that they ran out of change quickly and if you didn't fiddle quickly to get the exact money then they refused to issue a ticket - keep the coins handy. Glad to read about ticket validation machines (simple punch stamp) on this forum; not obvious on the platform unless you know that you are looking for them. Coming back (Saturday afternoon) plenty of departures but nothing dramatic at security in terms of queue and staff were friendly. Previous comments about lack of seating in corridors and then again at gates supported. Delays are always a pain but I could see how one here could be worse than most if and when it happened and you were already at the gate.,4,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,T Neuhaus,,Interesting experience as the airport has some very positive and some very negative aspects. Firstly no queue at check-in no queue at security at all. Staff quite friendly at both. In other words departure could be very smooth. On the other hand as other people have pointed out the airside lounge after security is really lacking- while it is fairly light and offers a few shops / food outlets it does not have anywhere near enough seating. The gate areas too can get very crowded and once you pass through passport control (very slowly!) there aren't even any toilets. The toilets just behind security incidentally were filthy without any toilet paper and no cleaners in sight. Also the airside area does not have any cash machines at all so if you want to purchase something you will need to have enough cash on you already or a card that is accepted by the outlets. As for the train links to the city centre: they aren't too frequent and the S-Bahn takes quite a while (going through the not-so-nice suburbs) but the arrangement is just about adequate given that the airport is never actually that busy compared with most other capital cities.,3,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,Carole Tait,,I used this airport for my first trip to Berlin on March 2nd. I found it was better than expected very well sign-posted and the enquiry desk staff were very helpful. I didn't know which rail ticket to buy from the machine or how to 'validate your ticket' but having English speaking staff with great patience solved everything. It could be improved by more seating if possible but otherwise it's just fine by me.,4,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,B Cowan,,I've used this Airport a number of times in recent years. My main complaint is the lack of seating on the 1st floor level in fact apart from the cafe there is nowhere to sit. As for public transport I think the service in excellent. You can buy a 1/2/3/4 day Welcome card at the newsagents on the ground floor as soon as you enter land-side you can then either take the free shuttle to the rail station from just outside the terminal building or walk along the covered walkway which is only a 3/4 minute walk. The AirportExpress service runs every 30mins to the heart of Berlin. Overall all services at this small Airport are acceptable bearing in mind that a new Terminal building and car parks and an additional run-way are being built along side the existing Airport complex and will replace the other 2 Berlin Airports in 2011.,4,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,M Hermann,,The only good thing about SXF that I can think about is it's train station which is serviced by regional trains a few national trains and the S-Bahn. So you can get to the city centre quite fast and quite comfortably (approx 30 min) and thus avoid high taxi fares. In order to get to the train station you will have to walk a couple of minutes. However I can't understand people complaining about the distance from the terminal to the train station. Compared to other international airports the station is actually quite close. Now the pitfalls. Immigration officers at SXF work at an amazingly slow pace when checking (EU) passports upon arrival and seem to enjoy working even slower in the late evening hours when all the budget airlines come in at once. Baggage reclaim is absolutely overcrowded when two or more planes arrive at the same time. This is true for the whole airport which is small and cramped and has been extended without any sense for functionality. Especially the lack of seating at the gates and queing in narrow corridors is annoying. Overall this does not feel like an airport.,2,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,A MacPherson,,The good points about this airport are the cheap and frequent train link to central Berlin (once you negotiate the ticket machines!) and the way it is split up into different screening/checkin areas and has passport control at the gates so there are no huge queues at central checkpoints supposed to serve all passengers. The bad points having departed again from the A area on the 22nd are a hopeless lack of airside seating and spartan 'lounges' at the gates themselves - it's worth going as soon as the gate is (eventually) announced in order to get a seat and avoid a queue at the passport desk but the downside of that is being left in the lounge area to wait with absolutely no information about delays and no access to something as simple as a toilet while hanging about. These two gripes go for every time I have used this airport. New this time were the obnoxious security staff at the screening point - like the man who was having a conversation with his colleagues while screening me and shouting 'hello' as if I was a moron when I didn't put my foot where expected for checking. Also there used to be a free shuttle bus between the train station and terminal saving a ten-minute walk in the freezing cold but it wasn't signposted this time - does that mean it has stopped? As an airport experience at a major city this could be really very good but let down by the lack of information and seating and security staff. The good points (accessibility speed of passenger processing) are very very good; the bad (dreadful waiting areas and lack of information and on this instance some of the staff) were very bad - so it gets a 3 from me.,3,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,Rob Wating,,No queue at immigration less than a 5 minute wait for luggage at the carousel and straight out of the main doors. Previous comments about it been a long walk to the train station iIts a brisk 3 min walk or slow 6 min. Once at the station all of the machines have an English button and when I was there gave change. If I remember it was less than 3 Euros for the 25 minute journey - a bargain when compared with the £15 for Stansted Express! There are machines in the underpass plus some on the platforms. All in all from the door of the plane opening to me been sat down on a train to the city centre was less than 20 minutes.,5,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,K Armstrong,,I expected better at a German airport. What an inefficient and uncomfortable place to fly through. Arrival was fine but departure was a different story. First there was a huge and disorganised queue before check-in to scan hold luggage. This meant crowds of peope were often blocking the tops of the escalators potentially dangeorous I thought. Then followed another long wait to actually check-in then another to get through the security at the departure gate. All told we spent about 1 hour queuing from arrival at the airport to clearing security. Just as well we arrived with plenty of time but not too much because after security there is nothing to do. Unless I missed something all there was was a smallish duty free shop cafe and bookshop (no books/mags in English). There were hardly any seats either. Disappointing experience. I like Berlin but not this airport.,2,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,Deryck Fay,,Have flown through SXF a few times in the past years and found it unremarkable. The facilities are limited but it's easy to get through. As others have noted the main shortcomIng is the train station. It's a long walk from the terminal and on my last trip there were long queues for the 3 ticket machines in the station underpass. After 20 minutes queuing we found that the machine would not give change or take coins and refused our Visa MC or Maestro. It appeared that the only way to get it to print a ticket was if the total was equal to a round number of banknotes! Having already missed 2 Regional trains and not wishing to spend the entire day in grim underpass negotiating the other machines we decided to ake our chances and pay on the train and made our way to the S-Bahn platform to find 2 machines without any queues... So much for Germany efficiency: it was like being back at home in Ireland!,3,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,David Allan,,Recently used SXF for flights from MAN/back to GLA. I echo the comments by Janne Petersson below - there is very little to do once you pass through security and there are also NO smoking areas after security so if you are a smoker go outside for a cigarette before passing through security. Interestingly we were delayed for more than an hour when it started to rain just prior to boarding - as the airport authorities refused to let anyone embark/disembark while it rained! At one point there were five easyJet aircraft parked in a row waiting for the rain to stop so they could disgorge their passenger loads.,3,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,Janne Petersson,,"I can´t understand the negative comments about problems obtaining railway tickets at Schönefeld: In the arrivals hall there are ticket machines for both DB (German Railways) and BVG (city transit authority) tickets and passes and there are also ATMs so you can obtain Euro banknotes for buying your tickets (remember Germany does not seem to be just as extremely ""creditcardified"" as the UK or Scandinavia so you may wish to carry a few Euro banknotes also for making other small purchases e.g. a beer or a soda.) Some other advice: Be prepared to wait in line but don´t check-in earlier than you have to: Once you have passed security there is absolutely nothing to do. There are not many seats either so if your aircraft goes tech you may have to stand for a long time while waiting. Well there are a two shops and a Burger King restaurant airside but that´s almost all. If you want something else to eat there is just one small café. The staff there were not very friendly and there was a big fly walking around on the sandwiches. It seems that SXF is nowadays mostly used by LCCs like EasyJet Germanwings et al and that may explain the lack of facilities. SXF somehow reminded me of M.R. Stefanik Airport in Bratislava Slovakia but BTS is much nicer and usually also much less crowded than SXF.",3,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,R Hopkins,,The problem with this airport is not the airport itself but getting tickets into the centre in the evening when the station is basically closed. The 'Tickets' signs are irrelevant when the ticket hall is closed and the only visible ticket machine doesn't take international cards. Go straight to the platform and get tickets there. Arrival was ridiculously slow because of the passport scrutiny. Of course they've got to be checked but how slow? This is the EU! Once through there was no luggage delay. Departure check-in was the fastest anywhere. Food at 'Cindy's' was reasonably priced and a super-fresh salad was available late in the evening. The airport was spotless and being continuously cleaned while we were there. Security was quick but the real downer was the queue for passport checks. I couldn't believe this could be so slow but it became clear that any non-white had to have their passports scrutinised much more carefully and slowly. This looked like overt discrimination. When there's been no check-in delay this queue came as a surprise. Overall this is a modern and efficient airport. Just sort out passport control!,4,0

berlin-schonefeld-airport,Rob Stephens,,I live in Berlin and it only takes half an hour to get from the station to the centre of Berlin (add up to 15 mins for Charlottenburg depending on exactly where you want to go). The trick is to take the Regional Bahn and not the S-Bahn - this means going a couple of platforms past the S- Bahn. Other than that I would recommend spending as little time as possible in the place - there's absolutely nothing to do. The comments about echoes of the DDR are spot on. Oh and a word of warning - they charge you 50 cents for a clear plastic bag if you need one.,,0
berlin-schonefeld-airport,Ellen Cornelissen,,Berlin Schönefeld is a pain. I do not know how the previous writer comes to 30 minutes to Berlin?

It´s a small airport and despite this smallness it takes ages to get your luggage. Let´s stick to the current setup (Tegel for business planes Tempelhof for city hoppers and Schönefeld for the holiday charters) and everybody will be very happy. Schönefeld still reminds me of the former GDR both in the people working there and the service provided.,,0

berlin-tegel-airport,David Killick,New Zealand,How much longer will Berlin's main airport keep going? The German capital's new international airport is behind schedule but should open in a year or so - 2016-18. Maybe. At present this airport seems impossibly small for a major city. We used it to ferry us back to Frankfurt to catch an international flight. Upsides: Tegel is compact and there's a good bar with Weissbier before you go through the very comprehensive security check. I am all for good security so that's a plus in my books. Also Tegel is easy to reach by taxi from most parts of the city (less than half an hour) and affordable (about €15-20). Downside: The airport is very basic with few other facilities on offer.,7,1
berlin-tegel-airport,R Brandenburg,Germany,Berlin Tegel is a usually overcrowded airport which has to deal with more than twice as much passengers as it has been designed for.

I will tell you that I will never go back to Berlin just from the unpleasant people at the airport! We had flown from Zurich to Berlin on #8120 connecting to Chicago #7420 on December 2 2014. The first bad thing happened when we got out of the airplane and were in the airport. We could not see any signs on where to go for our next flight. My husband suggested that I ask a nearby clerk and I asked where gate IAB was or something like that. She got really nasty and said ""can't you read?"" Yes I can read perfectly fine and my husband is a United Gold member who travels constantly and we could not find a sign for it. Then the TSA people! My husband was strip searched and when I was going through the security the women were horribly rude. Instead of asking me to please remove my scarf they pointed and yelled at me. They said ""your scarf - take it off!"" The airport was terribly furnished and uncomfortable for our layover - metal chairs. You have to realize that this is the first impression of a city that a person has. I will never go back there. It was very unpleasant and quite scary to be frank with you. Why do they need to be like that? Simple courtesy is always the best rule but I guess it doesn't apply to Berlin. Very disappointed and extremely upset after our layover there.",,0

berlin-tegel-airport,P Kniebusch,South Africa,Yesterday I arrived in Berlin Tegel. It is true that this airport is very crowded.

berlin-tegel-airport,V Mogollon,United States,For an airport in a major European capital city I was shocked at how small this airport was!

We didn't know where to go the security was badly sign-posted and when we did find it we were told to ""go and wait outside"". So we waited outside of the security area for a few minutes until finally we were told that we could go through - when I say that we were 'told' I mean that a man waved his hand at us to go through whilst still deep in conversation with his colleague. The first security man (quite miserable-looking) asked for our boarding passes then as we were getting them out he continued to shout ""boarding passes"" at us. He asked us ""are there liquids in the bags"" to which we replied ""no"". The bags were then thrown into the scanner and we walked through the metal detector. There was no one there to tell us when to go through as four of them were having a conversation. We then waited for our bags to come out of the scanner. There was a man glancing at the screen of the scanner. He asked us (in German) ""who's bag is this?"" I sad that it was my bag. He then asked if there was a 'computer' in it - it had my iPad in it. So I was asked to take it out which I did happily. My sister's bag containing her iPad came through after mine he asked her the same questions. He then shouted ""you were asked to take the computers out"" and pointed to his friend who then appeared and shouted at us.

berlin-tegel-airport,Anthony Morr,United States,Has to be one of the worst airports to fly out of. The airport is old inefficient and has no redeeming qualities. I flew an international flight out of Berlin on Air Berlin from Tegel to Chicago. The passport control had a line almost an hour long with one guy checking people in. Once through passport control you go through the electronic screening and then get placed in a holding area which has no bathrooms hardly any seats (probably half of what is needed) and no services. The airport also has not internet access for travelers except expensive paid internets through service providers. Its really a dismal place and an airport to be avoided if at all possible.,1,0
berlin-tegel-airport,S Hafeez,United Kingdom,As small and efficient as it is it still is a depressing little place. There's next to no food options after security. The duty free is an absolute joke.

berlin-tegel-airport,E Jensen,United States,Aterminal has been outgrown and appears to be a bit of a relict. Security checkpoints are situated at each gate which means that once you pass through the security queue many of the typical airport amenities are no longer accessible. The common areas appear to be quite crowded and the likelihood of finding a power outlet is very low if you need to charge a device. Seating is also competitive. Lounge access is critical for a comfortable stay otherwise it would not be wise to arrive early. Walking times are very abbreviated but that partly relates to the fact that the terminal is so small and space is cramped. Not a first rate experience for sure and I would recommend minimizing your time here.,2,0

All walking distances are very short (between gates parking public transport lounge etc.). Negatives: Offers only few global connections outside Europe.

Eventually we found the Globeground office (no signposts) two nice ladies took our details. We tracked our luggage to Berlin through KLM.

berlin-tegel-airport,F Wissmann,Switzerland,Berlin Tegel airport is an architectural masterpiece and it's concept is fantastic (round design for short distances). Back in the 1970 and 1980 that worked. But then the number of passengers grew and grew... Until the airport became as overcrowded as it is today. The airport is near the city centre but it lacks a train-connection to it. The staff is friendly and it is doing it's best. But Berlin Tegel during rush hour is a nightmare. The whole place is overcrowded space is limited so are the number of restaurants kiosks shops toilet facilities. I even had problems finding a place to sit down. Most parts of the airport including the immigration counters the airline desks and the toilet facilities still look like they must have looked like in 1985 or so. I like Berlin Tegel airport because it is near the city centre and because it is an icon of airport architecture. But it is good that Berlin is getting a new airport. I will miss Tegel airport but I will not miss the experience.,4,0
berlin-tegel-airport,W Webb,United Arab Emirates,As a frequent traveler I expect airport security personnel to be surly and poorly trained - that's a given. But the Securitas staff at D terminal exhibited a level of incompetence and indifference to their tasks that was not only disconcerting as a traveler but terrifying as a member of the public. The staff didn't seem to know anything about security topics equipment or procedures and even worse didn't seem to care. It only got worse when some of the passengers were exhibiting more professional and orderly security-oriented behavior than the Securitas staff pointing out bags that were unattended or dangerous material that wasn't handled properly.,,0
berlin-tegel-airport,L Donald,United Kingdom,Arrival at Tegel was fine. Our baggage arrived very quickly and the baggage hall was only a few yards from the exit. A taxi was immediately available and we were into the city in no time. Presumably what helped was that our flight had been delayed and we were the only flight coming in at that time at that time of night. Departure in the middle of the afternoon was rather different. Signage is not good and even getting into the terminal through the crowds of people outside waiting for public transport into town was not easy. Inside was worse. Just like a prefab shed with hundreds of people standing in queues or milling about. There was very little room for the number of people. After security there was not nearly enough seating for people waiting for flights. The heat was intense and facilities were totally inadequate. I suppose that nothing is being done at Tegel because of the future opening of the new airport but the airport as it is would certainly make us think twice about using it again.,3,0
berlin-tegel-airport,Lawrence Salvoni,Spain,As a seasoned traveller I feel I have to comment on Berlin's Tegel Airport. Friday 30th August 2013 was my first visit sadly I have to go through there again next week but what a shambles! This has to be the worse designed airport in Western Europe it resembles a series of porta-cabins linked by wooden stairs and walkways with ridiculously cramped corridors little in the way of seating shops toilets lounges or comfort. Reading Air Berlin's literature one is under the impression that they keen to use Tegel as a hub and win customers! Well they may be providing a reasonable service but this airport will not assist in their objectives it has to be the worse I have seen in some 20+ years of travelling. A regular visitor to the capitals of Europe Middle East and South East Asia on a monthly basis with 70+ long hauls a year Tegel is even worse than Paris CDG now that's saying something!,,0
berlin-tegel-airport,Piotr Wodkiewicz,Germany,When departing from or arriving at Berlin Tegel Airport it does not matter if you fly Air France or Air Berlin like a I frequently do you always feel like you step into a third world country. The airport is small overcrowded. The security personnel are rude and make crude jokes. The toilets are small and dirty. The duty free services are a joke. It is a shame that Germany's capital has such a disgrace of an airport system.,3,0
berlin-tegel-airport,H Oberbeckmann,Germany,Airport is quite small and neat but the shopping possibilities are not got Terminal A Duty Free shop when entered the security area is tiny.,6,0
berlin-tegel-airport,M Scott,United Kingdom,A shambles of an airport one entry point to security for my flight but shared with 2 other flights and only one security line. Resulting chaos had airline pleading for an extra security check. Security check when I got to the line had Teutonic thoroughness as an excuse of incompetent slowness - a view shared by many fellow passengers. Apparently a new airport was to be ready last year but faults meant it has been knocked down and has to be rebuilt and won't be ready until 2015.,4,0
berlin-tegel-airport,R Forrester,United Kingdom,This must be the most inefficient airport for international travel I have come across. Instead of having a centralised passport and security area each Gate has its own security and passport area which are set up on landing and after check-in. The net result is that after landing there is a queue stretching back to the aircraft while immigration is carried out. That's bad enough but on departure our area was not set up until 1 hour 15 minutes before the departure time. As we had arrived in good time we and other passengers were stuck on what little seating there was for 45 minutes until the security and passport area was set up. The lesson is - don't arrive earlier than 90 minutes before your departure time because you will only have to wait.,1,0
berlin-tegel-airport,J Battersby,South Africa,This has to be the most chaotic airport I have travelled to (and I do over ten international flights per year in Africa USA and Europe). On arrival there is virtually no information on transport to the city and on leaving there is absolutely no signage as to where the various airlines fly from. I eventually found Air France in Terminal D. I then volunteered to go on standby and was allowed into the Air France lounge. Going through security took an absolute age and then the boarding gate area was chaos. Too many flights for the space. And virtually no toilets. I did not get on my original flight and was then sent back to the Air France desk who where severely understaffed and completely unable to operate their computer system. I have now back at the lounge with no ticket while they try and figure out how to do something that should be obvious. In summary the airport as a whole is chaotic and understaffed. The facilities are outdated and too few for the number of flights catered.,2,0
berlin-tegel-airport,L Mats,Sweden,You have to judge it for what it is. A city airport not an international hub. Can't really understand any complaining about different terminals. The airport is so small that the different gates have different terminals ie Terminal A - gate 1-20 or so and up to terminal E. The farthest terminal E is some 75 meters away from the first A. From security to gate another 75m. No need for any additional trolleys etc. Small environment - small taxfree with the obvious perfumes and drinks no more. Supposed to close in near future for some years now but about to be expanded first!,8,1
berlin-tegel-airport,R Bonnici,Malta,The check-in timings were disgustingly long which took me in excess of 45min. Thankfully I had no close connection flight as I would have surely lost it. I could not make out what was holding the 2 operators from doing their job. When it was almost my turn they were happily chatting together with no concern and without informing the passengers on the hold up.,1,0
berlin-tegel-airport,R Maldoom,Germany,An airport for people who want hassle free travel not for shopaholics and those who think they have to buy things they don't need because they are in an airport. You can grab a sandwich or a coffee a newspaper of travel item. No long electric walkways very short distances. About ten meters from taxi to check in and same from check-in through security to waiting lounge. Easy access to city always taxis good fast bus services. Friendly relaxed staff. A great experience after the endless generic franchise retail outlets and long walks from entry to check in to security to boarding gate in the nightmare airports of Heathrow Frankfurt et al.,10,1
berlin-tegel-airport,Victoria Goldman,United States,I can see that Tegel would be a great airport at which to arrive as all of the distances are really short and the gates are quite near the exits. However I must say it's probably the worst airport I've been to when it comes to departing. I arrived at 9:30am to check-in; probably fifty people were waiting in line to check in - but apparently the check-in for Air Berlin doesn't open until 1000? I wanted to sit and read while waiting for my flight but learned that security for my gate wasn't supposed to open till 11:00AM - actually employees arrived at 1100 to get ready; it didn't actually open till 1120. So I had about two hours before going through security and could find neither a place to sit down nor good food options. Once I made it passed security I encountered a relatively tiny somewhat dirty waiting area and a tiny little food stand. At most airports you have many food/drink options beyond security; this is not the case at Tegel. I guess my review doesn't matter much as this airport will be closing within the year.,3,0
berlin-tegel-airport,X Codina,Spain,TXL-BCN. Tegel is simply a different concept of airport for a big city something that throughout my experience of flying I had never seen. I carried out two flights. On one flight I departed from terminal D and the other from Terminal A. The distances between gate and terminal are almost inexistent. You get off the taxi and the Boarding gate is about 20 or 30 meters from the entrance. In Terminal A instead of having a general metal and X-ray machine for each gate has its own security control. Queues for check-in were in my case extreme in Terminal A I was standing for 1.5 hrs waiting. After check-in each counter has its own way in to the boarding gate. Once you get in forget about finding plenty of shops and restaurants perhaps just one duty free shop in a tiny waiting room. Toilets are not really dirty but they could look cleaner or more modern. In my opinion Tegel is an airport that is nowadays outdated. The new airport Berlin-Brandenburg opening in 2012 is going to provide Berlin with a real international and hi-quality airport.,2,0
berlin-tegel-airport,Paul Van Alsten,France,CDG-TXL. Airport simply convenient but not fantastic. Main advantage is the very short distance between aircraft and airport exit. Regular and convenient bus connections to various downtown locations - TXL line serves Berlin central station and Alexanderplatz while X9 line runs to Zoologischer Garten railway station. Using the self-service ticket machines outside the terminal is the quickest option as information booth is usually overcrowded. Check-in efficient and hassle-free. Security staff friendly but a bit too relaxed. On the downside boarding areas are rather cramped - do not go airside too early. All signs within the terminal should be clearer in particular regarding public transportation.,3,0
berlin-tegel-airport,N Werner,Switzerland,It is a very small but efficient airport if you can use Terminal A. The distances are very short between the plane and the exit and everything is on one floor. For European flights you can arrive around 30 min before departure and still have ample time left as everything is so close. Staff encountered was friendly and competent. Transportation with the taxi is good and rather cheap for Europe. However there is not much to do at the airport as it is so small so do not bother coming to early. Also there are not many washrooms and the ones available are very small. Still it's a good airport to travel through.,4,0
berlin-tegel-airport,D Lee,Singapore,Good well planned Airport. Bus from plane to immigration then immigration checks and after that bags waiting for collection on the belt. Clearer signs to direct people to public transport are welcome but overall Tegel is very good.,5,0
berlin-tegel-airport,J Moff,Germany,Tegel was built to be an airport of short distances - so at least at Terminal A (which is the only one I know) the walking distance from the plane to the taxi is 30 meters - including passport control baggage claim and customs. The same is for departure: The security is right next to the check-in and after passing it you face the gate. However there is no space. The queues in front of the check-in can be a real obstacle if you need to get past them. Furthermore after the security check you arrive at a small waiting area for only two gates - small means there are enough seats but at best only one small shop selling drinks. So if you are early at check-in and fancy a coffee it is better to first visit the coffee shops in the main hall rather then going directly through security. One big plus is the public transportation: Even at late evening every ten minutes a bus is leaving to the city and the ride takes only 15-20 minutes - with the ticket costing not more than about 2 euro. If you are departing from Tegel for the first time you should mind that the system might be a bit uncommon to you (every gates has its own check-in security and waiting area) so be there in time. But as soon as you know it you can make use of it leaving the hotel only 60 minutes before take-off.,5,0
berlin-tegel-airport,Linda Lehnert,Mexico,This is a small airport and is easy to use because of that. Parking is a nightmare; the underground parking near the main terminal is better than the other parking which involves long walks to the terminal. Overall it's a nice airport and is more convenient than Schoenefeld.,5,0
berlin-tegel-airport,S Erich,,"TXL (main terminal) was designed as an O&D airport to allow for fast boarding and leaving. So distance between the road and the aircraft is roughly 25 meters with the check-in counter and gate-security-control just inbetween. I believe there is no other airport in the world offering such a short walk from car to aircraft. The one terminal ring (of 2 planned) was designed to handle no more than 6.5M passengers and now copes with over 10M passengers. The cramped airport has undergone considerable refurbishment so now you walk down stairs to board via bus at many gates. Shops and tiny food outlets were added while closing the two large bars in the ring taking space away and adding flows of walking passengers to the terminal with the plaza now being in the main hall. Long walking from there if you fly from gate 7 or 8. Car access to the airport is a disaster since there are two highways and a major street offloading traffic to just a two lane road passing a tiny bridge. Dont try to read the departure-board alongside the road - you wont succeed. So better know where your gate is before getting there or get off the car at the main hall which lengthens your walking-distance to the gate though. Make sure that you know if you fly from the old terminal or the C-""terminal"" - a hastily constructed oversized hut largely for Air Berlin. No boarding bridges there and it has the atmosphere of an industrial storage. You have to get outdoors to get from terminal A to C or to the ""B pier"". Tegel was a great idea but was never expanded accordingly so passengers there are cramped like hell at peak times there or when there are major weather-delays. In the end one positive remark: While the underground-train station in TXL was never connected to the Berlin underground-train system there is good connection via bus to the city centers east (TXL bus) and west (X9 bus plus 109)as well as to train stations of U-Bahn (lines 6 and 7 via bus 108 and 109) and S-Bahn (S45 - 47 high frequency ""ring-trains"") as well as some regional trains at Jungfernheide-station (X9 and 109 bus). A sharp and positive contrast to SXF which should better only be accessed by car or expansive taxi!",3,0
berlin-tegel-airport,S Muransky,,It depends on what you expect from Tegel. I used Terminal C and it's OK. It's not the nicest airport in the world but easy to use. After arrival I was in front of terminal less than minute after leaving aircraft (no checked baggage). There is Relay (press) and some coffee in check-in hall where you came from baggage claim. Departure is also OK. If you love shopping before departure it won't be the best airport for you (there is one common duty free souvenirs Relay and coffee) but otherwise it's good. Check-in fast security fast gates OK. Just standard airport. Don't expect fantastic experience but neither terrible airport.,4,0
berlin-tegel-airport,B Walberer,,TXL airport appears to be quite old and was overall very crowded. There is a decent selection of shops and eating places. It is hard to walk around due to long lines at some checkin counters. Overall a neutral experience - not bad by any means but certainly not a top airport either.,3,0
berlin-tegel-airport,Malcolm Johnston,,A very efficient airport arrived there from London-Heathrow after a 22 hour flight from Australia and was out of the terminal within 15 minutes. Slightly depressing architecture and terminal but it does the job.,4,0
berlin-tegel-airport,J Ludewig,,Overall a convenient airport short distances easy baggage claim at the gate. Only minus was that they did not deliver our kid's stroller at the gate but only thru the baggage claim - which is common policy at TXL as I was told after complaining. It also arrived damaged. Still ok airport - when travelling w/o strollers.,4,0
berlin-tegel-airport,Yevheniy Kahanovych,,Good and swift on arrival however it is just bad to depart from. Very slow check in with no line management. Very crowded when more than two flights are checked in at the same desk area. Air Berlin terminal is a joke. The good points are terraces with cafes food options inside the building location within the city. Bad points are gate areas slow check in and boarding. Not very inspiring but it works.,3,0
berlin-tegel-airport,V Dvoyris,,TLV-TXL-TLV. Swift inbound processing took about 15 minutes including the fact that our plane was in the middle of the field and we used the airside bus. Got inside the terminal the passport control was right pass the door and the baggage belt was right behind there. The outbound process was strangely quick. There was no personal questioning (very unusual for a flight to Tel-Aviv) the check-in desks were vacant and the security screening was swift. Only problem was that we had to spend 2 hours in the airport doing nothing in a small terminal without even a proper duty-free shop or a wireless connection.,4,0
berlin-tegel-airport,Janne Petersson,,"Remove the check-in machines and some of the advertisements and you have your typical 1980's West German Airport. Beware of the strange layout and be sure you have enough time to find your gate after check-in but don't go through security too early - the gate area can easily get crowded. Also don't expect to be amazed by the duty free shops. Tegel Airport is great when you arrive but strange and complicated when you depart. I would actually prefer using Schoenefeld Airport again next time (I know Schoenefeld is ""the less fancier option"" in Berlin but that doesn't matter to me)",2,0
berlin-tegel-airport,J Scott,,"Arrived in Tegel Friday evening at 22:30 and left the following Tuesday at around 16:00 from and to Barcelona. Arriving we had learned from a previous disastrous experience when we raced off the plane and straight through the narrow reception area which incorporates an individual belt receiving bags from your flight only. On that previous occasion we were stranded inside the main terminal area and it took an awful lot of time indeed to sort out the mistake and reclaim our ""abandoned"" luggage in a distant corner. This time we made no mistake though it strikes me that this unique element of the Tegel experience does require greater explanation from the airlines on the plane before arrival.The close location of the bus station with respect to the terminal coupled with the outstanding Berlin public transport system which allows routes and times to be discovered in minute detail i.e. down to the nearest specific bus-stop on the net before arriving meant that the trip to our hotel was well nigh effortless even at such a late hour. Naturally the trip back to the airport on public transport was equally impressive but on arrival there things were marginally less impressive; though only marginally. The Air Berlin flight was leaving from terminal C which is a fairly short walk away from the main terminal. C is located on the same level as the runway whereas the main historic terminal is located some 20m higher but there is an excellent capacious lift available. Terminal C is designed on the shed principle aka as the cornflakes box principle viz a cuboid box with the pavement at the front the planes at the back and with check in taking place towards the front. The longest edge of the box is parallel to the runway. One half of the front of the box is taken up with a single large bookstall type business and a single cafeteria style business with standard European airport rip-off prices for drinks. The only seating space before passing through the security screening is at the cafeteria. In other words there is no ordinary seating for waiting whatsoever here. However the piece-de-resistence is the queue for security. All 8 machines are in the same corner and no thought whatsoever has been given to controlling the access to these machines. Anyone wishing to avail themselves of machine 8 at the end of the hall must actually break through lines 1-7 to get there. Just as anyone wanting access to machine 7 must break through lines 2-6. And so on if not quite ad infinitum. Unbelievable in a facility opened in the last 12 months in the European city with the most extensively inexpensively impressive public transport network I have yet seen. Once through the ""Tax-free shopping mall"" (sic) which provides the only route available to get to the plane the next part of the box is at least spacious and does have a fairly good supply of seating beside the gates leading straight out onto the runway with the planes parked within 10m of the terminal. On a quiet Tuesday afternoon in April with the sun shining none of these negative elements caused any serious problems but at a busy time on a wet or snowy winter day I am sure the experience would be much less pleasant.",4,0
berlin-tegel-airport,Tony McLaughlin,,I was amazed after arrival at Tegel Terminal A - not 20 minutes after stepping on to the air bridge I was in my taxi in to Berlin. On stepping off the bridge you are at passport control and straight away at the belt for your flight then straight away at customs then out the door. Marvellous. I could see potential problems when checking in but personally did not encounter any.,4,0
berlin-tegel-airport,K Pearson,,Berlin Tegel is really past its sell by date. At the booking-in desks there are usually long queues with little or no supervision and to make matters worse some of the queues tend to merge with other queues. On 7th December 2007 we waited for 1 hour and 20 minutes just to book in for our flight to Amsterdam. There was a further 20 minute wait to pass through the gate security. The departure lounges have little or no facilities so people tend to delay arriving at the gate until the last minute and this probably helps to create the long queues. This also impacts on the small shopping area where to obtain a coffee you invariably have to stand as all the seating is occupied.,2,0
berlin-tegel-airport,David Allan,,Used the new Terminal C recently for Air Berlin flights to/from Vienna. Spanking new and spotlessly clean with few (although adequate) amenities. Efficient and smooth departure and arrival procedures.,4,0
berlin-tegel-airport,S McEewan,,First time to Tegel very busy restaurants full shops very busy very little seating which is a problem in most airports - thought we had a good idea to go into departure lounge thinking it would be like other airports we have used cafes etc on the other side. What a shock we got - the only thing available was a coke machine - at least there where seats.,,0
berlin-tegel-airport,Matthew Kenney,,What a charming little airport. I had the pleasure of passing through her recently and found it to be one of my favorite airports in Europe (too bad nobody flies into TXL from BOS). not so long immigration lines with friendly staff. typical german experience while waiting for my bag quick and efficient.,,0
berlin-tegel-airport,Alexander Montgomery,,For the occasional traveler TXL may be too small with a too little restaurants and shopping but for the frequent flyer it's a real gem and my favorite airport. The fact that check-in passport control security tax-free shop and waiting lounge are all encapsulated together in their own units is ingenious. Arriving 15 minutes before the gate opens gives you plenty of time to reach your flight on time. Also the cab ride from a Ku'Damm hotel is only 15 minutes or so (outside of rush hour of course) and is under 20 Euros. Security is a bit strange sometimes e.g. they only let me take one throw-away lighter on board (I had three with me). What's that all about?,,0
berlin-tegel-airport,Richard Walsh,,Coming back home through Tegel to London last Friday morning we were appalled by the lack of awareness and consideration for the problems of the disabled/handicapped traveller . We also found the lack of comfort and facilities once we had been through departure gates and security very disappointing. Specifically disabled people who turn up on time for a two hour check-in really do not appreciate having to stand for nearly an hour before being able to check in with no opportunity available to sit down. Even once we had checked in we were unable to go directly to the departure lounge because another flight had to be cleared out first. Then when we got to the departure lounge we were disconcerted to find that there was no direct access to airline lounges ( we were travelling business class) where we could have relaxed. In short we found these facilities would have been fine for a short- haul local airport but quite inadequate for a major international destination.,,0
berlin-tegel-airport,Michael Brosch,,I use Berlin Tegel at least once a week and consider it the most convenient and best airport I have been to. Many mornings I leave my home in central Berlin less than an hour before departure park my car right under the gate and within minutes I have received my boarding pass either from an e-kiosk or from the mostly considerate and friendly check-in staffers. I often have even time to pick-up a newspaper and drink a quick fruit juice in the lounge. The highly efficient security check at each and every gate is another big advantage compared to other airports and it is better than the the ones in Munich or Frankfurt. Berlin Tegel makes travelling very easy and stress free and as much as I am looking forward to the new Berlin-Brandenburg Airport set to open in 2011 I will miss the convenience of our current airport.,,0
berlin-tempelhof-airport,Peter Cullen,,I used Tempelhof for the first (and I guess last) time last week. It is wonderful - why are modern airports not like this? The history and architecture are fabulous of course but it also works incredibly well - admittedly having so few flights means nothing is really under pressure. As noted elsewhere public transport links are excellent one can be in the city centre within 15 minutes of walking off the plane. From the departure lounge to seat on the aircraft takes less than a minute. I guess it is an anachronism in the 21st century but it is sad to say goodbye to an airport with real character.,5,0
berlin-tempelhof-airport,Lisa Sanders,,Templehof is a dream. The architecture is beautiful and the departure hall is stunning. Some of the original features can be found a true jewel.

berlin-tempelhof-airport,W Wynants,,This post World War II airbridge landmark is probably the best airport location worldwide. Nowadays it is called Zentral Flughafen and that is because the U-bahn is only a 3-minute walk . From here it only takes minutes to get anywhere in the city. The terminal is completely outdated but very charming: Planes park literally in the terminal and boarding and deboarding happen always dry thanks to the roof of the hangar. The toilets are clean there is a delishop/bar and all major car rental companies have a desk. Unfortunately THF is not smoke free passengers still smoke in the smoking area of the already small waiting areas at the gates.,5,0
berlin-tempelhof-airport,Matthew Ross,,Very convenient for the city centre. Unfortunately there are a limited number of routes (but Brussels Airlines offers a good service several times per day). The advantage is that the airport is uncrowded - at times almost deserted. I regret that it is now living on borrowed time. There is a Berlin Underground (U-Bahn) station nearby but there are quite a few steps - so it is difficult for passengers travelling with luggage let alone disabled travellers.,4,0

When I finally cleared the initial security screening and checked in for my flight I commenced queuing once more the queue which was very slow became absolutely chaotic when people entered the queue from the sides and no airport staff or security staff intervened. The entire experience showed a level of inability in the security or airport staff to ensure orderly queuing and safety of passengers. I will be very reluctant to use this airport again.,,0
berlin-tempelhof-airport,Jens Mueller,,Oldest airport that is still in use but great! The mother of all airports has an impressive architecture huge size and is very close to the city.

berlin-tempelhof-airport,Mark Evans,,One for the historians of airport architecture a real time-warp from the 1960s and earlier. This was the original pre-WW2 Berlin airport. The paucity of flights serving Tempelhof make for a very stress-free environment. Emerging from the terminal one finds oneself in an ordinary residential street the facade of the terminal blending in with the neighbouring apartment blocks. The U-Bahn station is just 300 m away and one is in the heart of Berlin cheaply and in double-quick time. But look again at that facade towards the top: there's a gap. Wasn't that where the old regime's notorious symbol used to stand?,,0
berlin-tempelhof-airport,Christian Seefeldt,,Easy to get there - free parking just in front of it - super fast check in and so on. It took me 10 minutes from the moment I parked my car to the lounge. Highly recommended. The only problem is nearly no flights leaving here !!,,0
bermuda-airport,E Williams,United States,"This airport is horrible on the arrival side and barely passable on the departure side. On both the airport management should look into ""jetways."" Problems arriving: No jetway too few passport control personnel arrival hall to passport control inadequately air-conditioned going to the bathroom immediately on arriving puts you farther back in the passport line (I was near the front and waited just under an hour to reach the passport counter within 10 minutes the line had tripled in length so those people likely had to wait nearly 3 hours). Rude passport control officer. Extremely rude customs officer - she pawed through all my belongings being careful to disarrange them untidily. Then to the greeting area - no chairs to sit in while awaiting my pickup. Entire area filthy. By now I needed a bathroom a janitor directed me to one ""around the corner"" near a loading dock. It smelt of urine and was crawling with ants. Departure: confusing signage shops too few and overpriced at gate (upper level) one goes down a flight of stairs in order to go up a flight of stairs into the airplane. (At the bottom of the flight of stairs some sort of janitor screamed at me to show my passport. Oh well I suppose the boarding process needs more inefficiency.

Bus connection with Berne central station upon each regular incoming and departing flight - one-way costs 5.20CHF. Check-in efficient and hassle-free - online check-in has now been introduced. Status travellers have access to the airport lounge above the departure gate. The only downside is the airport website - it is rather difficult to navigate within it as there are lots of advertisement.,5,0
berne-airport,Paul Van Alsten,,Berne-Belp is a small but excellent regional airport. It is currently connected to Orly with Air France and Munich with Lufthansa. There is a bus shuttle upon each regular flight arrival (even delayed flights); travel time to Berne railway station is around 20 min. A major problem is the heavy fog in winter - I have already been diverted to Basle airport twice.,5,0
berne-airport,Robert Rothacher,,The new terminal building is probably the best small airport terminal in Europe. Small efficient very friendly and check-in procedure is made in minutes. Beside Munich by Lufthansa Amsterdam by KLM Intersky to Vienna and Berlin Brussels is now connected with Berne by EAE. Overall a great airport !,,0
berne-airport,Sascha Herzog,,Berne Airport (Airport of the Capital of Switzerland) is a regional airport with connections to Europes major cities. Also connecting to the international hubs of Munich and Amsterdam. Check-In time only 20 minutes prior to departure time. Airport Authority is building a new terminal which will be opened by may 2003. Temporary terminal is in use until the opening of the new terminal. Staff is very friendly! The motto is to serve the passenger from leaving the taxi or public transport until boarding the aircraft.,,0
bhubaneswar-airport,Prasad Vinnakota,United States,We were travelling from Bhubaneshwar to Hyderabad recently. The airport was clean and nice but was shocked a little later at the security at this airport. While we were flying a person behind my row was complained about dripping water. The stewardess was puzzled and checked the luggage rack. There was this bag belonging to a passenger that contained a bottle of water that leaked drenching all the bags in that part before trickling down on the heads of people below. Note that this is a colored rectangular serrated bottle and not one of those branded mineral water bottles sold inside the secure zone. Also note that the passenger was able-bodied. It is clear that the security checks simply waved the bottle past. Having travelled from Newark to Hyderabad via Mumbai and suffering innumerable checks and having spent a small fortune on buying water inside the secure zone I was shocked at this incident. I suggest that the rules be strictly implemented and a refresher course be held for the personnel.,4,0
biarritz-airport,Anthony Slade,United Kingdom,Chronic organisation when two planes arrived: it took almost an hour to get through passport control. On return the famous Gallic shrug came to the fore with no-one seemingly interested or caring about chaos and delays. Police attitude was unbelievable with their insistence of accompanying people visiting the toilets. The joy of flying into German and British airports!,,0
biarritz-airport,Brian Murphy,,Recently flew to and from Roissy CDG to Biarritz International in the Basque country in south west France for the first time. The airport itself is small but there is a good bus service which will take you into the city centre pretty quickly. On arrival on the 13.00 HRS AF 7638 flight from CDG this flight seemed to coincide with a number of other flights from the UK which made the baggage arrivals area chaotic. In addition the toilet facilities landside need some upgrading and definitely could do with the cleaners visiting there on a more frequent basis especially mid-afternoon which seems to be the peak time for the airport. The rubbish bin in the gents toilet was overflowing when I was there which left a poor initial impression! The airport does have an excellent tourism booth with very helpful staff however. In addition from the airport one can get onto the nearby motorway very quickly and the care hire agencies also had very helpful staff at the airport (especially Europcar). On departing Biarritz back to Paris however I discovered that the departures area has only one very small cafe so passengers may not want to enter this area too quickly as the wait could be long and somewhat boring. In summary the airport is convenient but it falls well short of the new fresher and modern design of nearby Pau airport which is excellent.,,0
bilbao-airport,S Parkin,United Kingdom,What a contrast to arrive from the chaos of Stansted. Plane lands bags come off quickly passport line 5-10 mins maximum. Taxis right outside airport arrivals (or bus stop turn right and go to the end of the concourse). My record for checking in at the hotel is 42 mins from the wheels touching the runway. Coming back on Easy Jet last flight out of the night so it's a bit quiet but again you get through quickly. Grab a beer. Don't even bother queuing until you see the incoming plane land and reach the gate. Very relaxed place to fly in and out of.,9,1
bilbao-airport,Marc Guillemard,France,Flew to and from Bilbao. Arrival was quick plane unloaded by Gateway. The building looks nice and is clean. The bad surprise was that we had to wait more than 30 minutes to see the first bag on the belt at a time we were the only plane arriving! I find this unacceptable in big airports and even more in a small one! Departure went well 2 coffees / breakfast facilities everything on time. A pity we got stuck in a bus 20 minutes while the plane was at 3 minutes walk!,7,1
bilbao-airport,Anna Kleinzahler,United Kingdom,Flew STN-BIO BIO-STN modern stylish terminal architecture some way outside Bilbao but perhaps the nearest bit of flat land to be found amongst all those hills. No problems on arrival speedy passport check and luggage quickly up on the belt. Same when leaving fact luggage drop and security control. Airport is clean staff friendly and helpful. Minor gripes: no free wi-fi no post office to buy stamps souvenir shop did not have any postcards food and drink air-side expensive lifts seem to have a mind of their own not enough seats on the ground-side. Bilbao well worth a visit even for a day but certainly a weekend.,7,1
bilbao-airport,C Goulding,United Kingdom,I agree with some of the post - it is a unwelcoming airport. The seating is really uncomfortable and very few. Sometimes one has to wait quite a while and so need to be able to sit in comfort - these seats are just hard plastic benches. The snack bar is just that. A proper restaurant is sorely needed. Give me the old airport any day. Have not been there for six years but will be doing so in a month's time in the hope there has been some improvement.,7,0
bilbao-airport,Yevheniy Kahanovych,Ukraine,Fast and efficient and looks interesting. On arrival bag was on the belt 5 minutes after flight. On departure there was no line at all to drop bag off to go through security to board the plane. When I arrived from London they forgot to stamp my visa for Spain. On departure they fixed it and were polite and apologetic. Small airport clean and efficient.,9,1
bilbao-airport,Dario Castillo,,Bilbao Airport has now a full fledged restaurant besides the bars. Traveling MAN-CDG-BIO often I found this airport by far the best experience of the three. At least it has not become a shopping centre with a runway attached to it.,4,0
bilbao-airport,Angela Cullum,,I have travelled in through this airport and seen many friends come and go. What is all the fuss about? It's a great little airport the staff aren't rude and some do speak English. It's a brilliant airport compared to the huge horrors of Charles De Gaulle and Heathrow. Sometimes I think people just love to moan.,4,0
bilbao-airport,L Eames,,Bilbao airport may be nice on the eye with its exciting-shaped exterior but the interior is dark gloomy and uninviting the seating is poor and uncomfortable the staff are rude apart from few exceptions the shops are risible in their offer. I was also puzzled by the fact that the staff at baggage control were very dismissive and rude when I asked if I needed to take my laptop out. In their non-English and sign-language (of course having a good part of customers and passengers as non Spanish does not make any difference) they told me almost laughing at me that I could send it through and why should I be so paranoid? Finally and I don't know if this has something to do with the carrier easyJet or the airport policy but I had my passport checked 4 times: first at the check in counter then by the easyJet ticket office (the only polite member of staff in the whole airport) then at the gate by an official and then few seconds later by the check in attendant. This after the flight was delayed by an hour and a half and the gate changed 3 times characteristically in completely different parts of the terminal. A really bad experience surprising from a city that has made lots of money from the tourists flocking in to see the guggenheim.,3,0
bilbao-airport,Duncan Watt,,Although the exit from the baggage claim goes directly outside anyone waiting to pick somebody up doesn´t have to wait outside if they take the escalators up to the terminal there is a landing halfway up which leads to a passageway (indoors) which overlooks the baggage claim area so they can actually look down on the passengers waiting for their bags from one floor above - it can get crowded in that passageway.,,0
bilbao-airport,Rolf Heelas,,Was not very impressed designed for not for function but as a statement which to me looked inspired by the 70's. The airport is small and has a few shops cafe's but nowhere to get any kind of food more than a small roll. Strangest thing was walking out of customs exit out into the cold. However strangest thing was security lots of police hanging around however the person screening hand baggage was doing so while reading a newspaper.,,0
bilbao-airport,Franco Iacovella,,I found Bilbao Airport to be a small and pleasant one to get through. No LHR or FRA airport here with all its confusion and chaos. Surprisingly enough there was no subway to the downtown core yet a 10 minute bus ride to the city center is all it takes on bus 3247 for 1.15 Euro each o/w. Upon departing Bilbao - caught the airport bus back to the airport as they depart every 1/2hour from Termibus Bus Depot. Punctual upon arrival - a quick easy check-in at LH counter - great lighting in the airport and nice to have the cafe with a view of the planes and tarmac while sipping cafe con leche once you have passed the security. I would rate the airport 8 out of 10 for easy signage clarity in lighting very smooth operations.,,0
bilbao-airport,Carlos Rodrigo,,I disagree with the comments. For a brand new airport Bilbao is a poor one. That it is now being rebuilt - just three years after its construction - confirms my bad opinion about this poorly built airport. Calatrava´s buildings may look nice but are totally unfriendly,,0
bilbao-airport,John Andrews,,Bilbao Airport is very modern and looks great from the outside. I've heard it described as seagull inspired but to me as you approach from a distance it looks more concorde inspired. Car parking is very convenient and a short walk from the terminal. When I've arrived by coach in Bilbao to catch a flight however it's a bit of a drag as there's no direct airport bus from the coach station so you have to catch the underground to the square in Bilbao from which the airport bus departs. The airport bus is cheap though at 1.10 euros. Inside the terminal I find it's all concrete and a bit spartan and claustrophobic the darkened glass doesn't help. The cafe area is pretty small but looks out over the runway so you can watch the planes while sipping a coffee. Having the exit from the baggage reclaim area lead straight out to the outside concourse rather than into the terminal building is a bit unusual as it means that people waiting to meet arriving passengers must wait outside in the cold.,,0
bilbao-airport,Lawrie Hall,,Overall I'd give Bilbao airport the thumbs-up. I've only departed so I don't have experience of arriving. Get airside as soon as possible as the bar/cafe is OK - but go in and find a seat as from the outside it is most unwelcoming.,,0
bilbao-airport,Krista Jones,,Despite it's beautiful external design (representing a seagull) Bilbao airport is probably one of the most uncomfortable user unfriendly airports that I have ever visited. The seating area is scarce with hard concrete benches. The cafeteria is small and the tables are always piled with dirty plates and glasses. Another of my complaints is that when passengers arrive and leave the baggage hall they come straight outside. This means that people waiting to collect arriving passengers have to wait outside in the cold/rain not very welcoming to say the least!!,,0
bilbao-airport,Daniel Mori,,This regional size airport is a gem. Not only does it have great design but it is also very functional. Ground transportation exceeds expectations as you can get a bus to/from Bilbao center for just 1EUR. The ride is quick and painless. Taxis are also available in large numbers and are affordable. Check in procedures are expedite and the staff is accommodating: one time I arrived at the airport 15 minutes before my flight and the counter staff was kind enough to check me in - the plane I was travelling on hadn't arrived it was nearly empty and I had no luggage but still I have to praise the decency of the staff for checking me in despite my delay (something not to be taken for granted in other airports). Security check waiting times are usually OK although some delays may occur in peak hours Overall BIO is a very good facility.,,0
bilbao-airport,Borja Diez,,The airport designed by Santiago Calatrava it's modern easy to use and offer a great image of the Basque Country. You can expect all the services from a big airport concentrated in an state of the art building.,,0
billund-airport,Eveline Lau,Hong Kong,Travelled from HKG to FRA then to Billund for a business trip. A tiny airport with insufficient facilities. A serious lack of staff while they were not helpful at all already. Self check-in machines available but not enough assistance at all. Medium length queues but moving very slowly.,3,0
billund-airport,Christian Britten,,Billund is an excellent airport with good facilities practical layout and friendly and efficient staff. My only gripe is the airport bus which is extortionate (DKK180 to Aarhus) and runs at often perplexing times that seem to have no correlation to when major flights are landing. I've travelled here every other month from various UK airports for about 2 years and sometimes have to wait up to 2 hours to get away. As the airport is far from where most foreign travellers want to be (unless they really like Lego) you often have little option but to wait for the bus or pay even more for a taxi.,4,0
billund-airport,Claus Nielsen,,My favourite airport. Fast efficient and very pleasant. Easy to get to easy to navigate check-in and security is always fast and friendly and the lounge above Security is great. Extremely roomy and classy great for work or relaxation even offers open smoker's cabins that don't feel like a cage - and a chess game for those with plenty of time. Almost everywhere in the airport can you overlook the runway and the whole place is just modern roomy and open. The airport size is an advantage without doubt - the distances between parking check-in security lounge gate and flight are minimal so getting in and out is always a pleasure. Much better than Copenhagen in almost all aspects.,5,0
billund-airport,Janne Petersson,,This is a fantastic airport. Short walking distances nice staff good easy-to-navigate easy-to-use layout a stress-free atmosphere nice cafés. I used Billund as a transit passenger on my way from Copenhagen to Berlin and my only minor remark is that the TRANSIT signs just pointed to a locked door. I had to walk back exit and go through security again. Never mind there was no queue and I doubt the locked door is standard procedure since the security folks got a little bit puzzled when they saw my Copenhagen-issued boarding pass. Don't hesitate to use this airport.,5,0
billund-airport,Hanne Eeg Jensen,,"Arrival: Nice short walking distance to baggage claim. Fast baggage delivery. Comfortable smokers lounge next to baggage claim. Relaxed atmosphere; but still very efficient operation. Car rental easy to find - so is the carpark for rented cars. Departure: Easy car return. Clean cheap airport hotel ""fit for purpose"". Several breakfast options in the check-in hall. Easy and friendly check-in. So is security check. I got a feeling that they had though about everything in this airport - and that maybe that is the reason why everything worked so efficiently the staff had energy to smile and the atmosphere is so relaxed.",5,0
billund-airport,J Morgan,,Billund is a stellar airport now to put it simply. It appears that not too many travellers are aware of the magnificent services offered at this airport. When recently travelling through BLL en route to Paris I was amazed by the design and atmosphere. BLL is chockers with beautiful details such as great furniture and airy Danish design gimmicks. Check in for my Maersk Air / AF flight was a breeze staff was friendly and immaculately groomed and the time spent from check in until I was onboard the new 737 was very pleasant - there are great shops and cafés and a good view to the many planes which you reach via airbridges. Would almost say that BLL is even better than its big brother in Copenhagen.,5,0
birmingham-airport,Nick Wilcock,United Kingdom,"I travelled through BHX last week with Lufthansa - outbound to Frankfurt on 21 Jul and inbound late on 22 Jul. Easy parking and a 3 min wait for the bus, check-in was quick and as a Frequent Flyer I was granted access to the priority security line. Reasonably quick, then through the perfumery to queue up for a coffee. Some of the seats near the boarding area have now been relocated (why?) - and Vodafone signals are still poor inside the terminal. But we left on time, so no real issues. On arrival, the flight was late out of FRA. It always seems to take the ground handlers ages to sort out the jet pier here though, but at least it wasn't a bus this time. Long queues at passport control, but the e-passport machines actually worked OK. It took only 4 minutes from stepping off the aircraft to leaving the passport machines, whereas the week before it took 25 minutes at LHR T2! Luggage arrived within 10 min, not bad for BHX! Crowds hanging around at the exit were as annoying as ever, but I was soon on the bus. My car park estimate had been 23:45 and I was later than that, but obviously their system knew of the late flight and I was soon on my way home. Overall an entirely acceptable travel experience - if only LH operated more flights from here! Unlike at LHR, lounge access isn't available for Frequent Flyers in Economy, which is the only disadvantage of using BHX.",7,1
birmingham-airport,Arthur Jackson,United Kingdom,"It's so frustrating that our local airport seems to have gone from bad to worse. Arrivals have always been a nighmare at BHX but departures are now almost as bad. Arriving 2 hours before a flight now leave no time for eating drinking or browsing the shops such are the queues at check in and security, which even has a queue to join a queue! Once through we had hoped for breakfast but found big waiting times at the three eateries we tried. We queued for 15 minutes for a cup of tea at Burger King who seemed to have 3 members of staff trying cope with the ""cooking"" and serving. Boarding had started so just time to grab a sandwich from Boots, the only place which seemed to have its act together, plenty of staff and the tills ringing. Arrival was chaos. Once through immigration it was over a very long and boring hour before our carousel decided to kick into life and start to do its thing. I frequently read that the airport has big plans to add more routes and airlines. All I can say is best of luck to the passengers if this does happen as I dread to think of what it will be like if it's any busier. I'll be flying from elsewhere.",1,0
birmingham-airport,R Field,United Kingdom,"This is one of my least favourite airports and one I shall try to avoid in future. Problems lining up steps to aircraft. Bus to terminal from airport appearing to get lost. Lots of stairs while carrying heavy bags. Slowness of luggage appearing, then stopping, then eventually turning up on another conveyor belt. Lack of frequent enough buses to car parks, meaning it was quicker to walk. All in all, organised chaos.",1,0
birmingham-airport,Lindsay Doughty,United Kingdom,"I am writing to complain about the disgusting state of the smoking area outside of the Meridien Bar at Birmingham airport. I am a smoker and was extremely shocked at the dirtiness of the balcony, not just cigarettes but glasses, cups, and litter. The ashtrays were overflowing. I have added some images of the area taken on the 1st June 2015. I would like to quote Imperial Tobacco's announcement of the opening of this area. The UK’s leading tobacco company, Imperial Tobacco, is delighted to announce the opening of a state of the art airside smoking area at Birmingham Airport. Travellers can now enjoy their chosen tobacco product free from the wind and rain in a dedicated area, accessible from the airport’s new departure lounge bar. This purpose built and unique facility provides lighting, shelter, hand gel and litter solutions. There is also a departures board to ensure travellers can keep track of their flights. If you are going to open a smoking area, which is much appreciated, please do not treat travelers like third class citizens and expect them to smoke in such a dirty disgusting place. I have included the first photos of the Birmingham airport smoking area and the latter of a comparison with Bodrum airport outside smoking area within the departure lounge.",2,1
birmingham-airport,Glyn Cookson,United Kingdom,"I have used it hundreds of times over the years and it still seems to have a dated culture. Departing is usually not the problem but arriving and waiting for gates and sometimes steps or an air bridge is a joke, it often appears as if the plane has ""dropped in"" unexpectedly and taken them by surprise. Luggage collection is also a bit of a joke, can wait up to an hour for luggage to appear on carousel. It's worth noting that BHX is trying for more long haul flights now that the runway has been extended for larger aircraft, but heaven help arriving passengers if this come to be, it'll be a nightmare under the present system of baggage handling on arrival. It lags well behind the likes of Manchester Airport. The £1.00 charge for a 10 minute drop off is extortion at it's very best.",1,0
birmingham-airport,John Everill,United States,"I live just 3 miles from BHX however would rather travel 80 miles to Manchester airport for a much better experience and ultimately a much faster return to home after waiting to clear border control and even longer waiting for cases to be put on the luggage belt. I have travelled from and to this airport dozens of times yet always it takes an age to get cases onto the luggage belts. Border control staffing levels also leave a lot to be desired. I honestly believe that this airport is the worst in the UK and amongst the bottom section in the whole world! For the second city of the UK this airport is an embarrassment and a disgrace. It should remove the ""international"" from its title as it is totally misleading as this airport is no more than a local airstrip with no customer orientation at all!",1,0
birmingham-airport,Susan Salter,United Kingdom,"I travel on holiday from Birmingham Airport at least 4 times per year. When going through security/baggage screening on the last 3 occasions my cabin luggage has been selected for further investigation. I have had all my personal possessions removed and thoroughly examined one by one on each occasion. I quite understand this, my only concern is that other people who are waiting in line for their bags to be checked can stand and watch every personal item unloaded and examined from my bag (after all what else have they to do at the time?). As I always carry my jewellery in my hand luggage, I feel that my bag itself is at risk after the contents being exposed to the public. Would it not be possible to have some sort of screen that hides personal belongings which are being examined from other passengers?",8,1
birmingham-airport,James Jones,United Kingdom,I travel frequently - about ten times per annum - to Jersey and back via BHX. I have noticed a gradual deterioration in the standard of ground handling for these flights at BHX. This dates from the change of terminals which now requires Jersey passengers having walked through the hideous perfume shops in the first terminal to walk a long way to the Jersey terminal where there is now only one inadequate junk food outlet apart from a small Boots and Smiths and a souvenir shop. BHX authorities have also removed most of the flight arrivals and departures boards including the most vital information board which is the one where you initially arrive in the terminal. One could be forgiven for thinking that the BHX authority has a prejudice against flights to Jersey and the other flights to UK destinations which leave from the same terminal and is determined to take it out on the passengers. However the main substance for my complaint is the truly awful level of ground handling for incoming Flybe Jersey/BHX flights which I have experienced in the last five flights I have made into BHX on this route. Invariably the aircraft is made to wait for its stand. Invariably there is a delay in getting the passengers off the aircraft. Invariably they are made to wait in the bus which takes them to the airside stairs to baggage reclaim. Yesterday for example there was a delay of 45 minutes from the time the aircraft on BE 502 stopped its engines before the passengers were able to retrieve their baggage and exit the customs area. 15 minutes in the aircraft before the doors were opened and the passengers loaded into a bus. A full 25 minutes waiting with locked doors in the bus before the passengers were allowed onto the airside stairs and another 5 minutes waiting in the covered walkway before we were allowed access to our luggage which had clearly been on the carousel for a long time. This is as I am sure everyone would agree totally unacceptable from a passenger point of view. It is also clear where the blame lies. Namely with the BHX ground handling organisation. Unless this is considerably improved I shall simply stop using BHX and I imagine so will many other potential UK destination customers. Yesterday was merely the worst of a long series if such delays in handling incoming flights from Jersey at BHX.,,0
birmingham-airport,A Martin,United Kingdom,Flew with Ryanair to/from Dublin. Has been a good few years since flying from Birmingham. Has improved but still nothing special. Queues for Security were good was through in around 10/15 minutes. Departure lounge is not great. Adequate choice of facilities low ceilings quite small and just a bit boring. Same has to be said about the Ryanair/Flybe pier. Arrival was pretty much the same. Flight was delayed until around 1am so the Terminal was pretty much closed so no queuing. Narrow corridors and not the most inviting of places. Only reason I'd consider BHX is because it's quite convenient and quite well served by public transport.,6,1
birmingham-airport,Keith Frost,United Kingdom,No seats for customers downstairs. Rip off prices in food outlets and for everything else. Not enough Border Force staff for the number of arrivals or is it just bad management (one hour delay at my last arrival) like a third world country set up. We were herded and corralled and the staff thought this was an acceptable situation worst airport experience we've ever had.,,0
birmingham-airport,R Martin,United Kingdom,Worst airport in the UK. Every other UK airport has high service levels and quick processes. We have now been waiting 1 hour 15 minutes for our baggage and I would say half of the plane passengers are in the same position. Sort it out BHX.,3,0
birmingham-airport,D Bosworth,United Kingdom,Landed at 21.15 on Sunday 22nd March 2015 from Sharm El Sheikh. Disembarked aircraft at 21.50. Reason for delay was that the wrong set of steps had been sent to the aircraft. Had to wait for replacement steps to be found. Not good enough Birmingham (especially if you have plans to expand). Why we weren't put on a jetty I don't know. Most of them were empty.,3,1
birmingham-airport,Arthur Jackson,United Kingdom,It really puzzles me why how this airport can so consistently get departures right and yet consistently make arrivals such a nightmare. I've rarely queued for check in or security which is so much better these days. The departure lounge is reasonable with plenty of choice for a relatively small airport. What annoys without fail is their arrivals handling. Maybe it's because there is less opportunity for financial gain from arriving passengers (although their charges for baggage trolleys might suggest otherwise). I've never found immigration anything but busy that is on a good day. On a bad day the place is heaving with passengers queuing up the stairs to the gate concourse. Problems are caused when passengers use the lift to reach immigration leaving them with no option but to push into the queue. One might assume that after the time taken to clear immigration at least your bags would be merrily enjoying their carousel ride. Rarely is this the case. Why is this airport so slow at getting bags to belt? Sure every airport has occasional delays but Birmingham seems to have nothing but delays when it comes to the arrival experience. Odd as you'd think the airport would want the passengers last memory of the airport to be a good one obviously they don't otherwise they would resolve the issues. The airport seems to be hell bent on expanding but seem to be unable to cope with the arrivals they already have.,4,0
birmingham-airport,R Whitaker,United Kingdom,Flew in last night (Feb 16th 2015) on Monarch ZB935 from Tenerife and had to wait over 45 minutes for bags to appear. Of the last ten times I have come through this airport only once have the bags arrived in a reasonable time and on a par with the many other airports I have used. I also find the mean mindedness of not having a free drop off area very irritating. In other ways the airport is pretty good but the baggage handling needs urgent attention. If it were not so close to home I would try other airports.,3,0
birmingham-airport,Gary Colburn,United Kingdom,On a par with Manchester in fact slightly better. Queues minimal facilities more than acceptable Terminal one is spacious and easy to navigate. The free shuttle to the train station is splendid although there are no buses or trains that serve this airport from the city centre round the clock. A solid 9 out of 10 for me.,9,1
birmingham-airport,G C Nock,United Kingdom,We arrived back into BHX at 18.15 Friday 2nd January on a Monarch flight we went through border control very quickly as there were a number of officers on duty. However the wait for our cases was pathetic the first case came onto the carousel at 19.05 we got our cases at 19.12 what a very poor effort from an Airport that is constantly hyping up itself about expansion and being an alternative to London. We live aprox. 17 miles from BHX and travel through there regularly. It's time they get a grip of what the travelling public want.,1,0
birmingham-airport,Nathan Mcilveen,United Kingdom,Good airport and security was a breeze however my flight to Dublin was delayed because 2 Ryanair flights one from Ibiza and one from Lanzarote landed at the gate beside us and because the swing door was opened to the passport control area arriving and departing passengers from the Ryanair flight to Dublin were made to wait around half an hour packed into the airbridge like sardines and staff would not let the passengers into the airport until all the passengers from Spain cleared passport control so the ground staff could shift the door into the direction of domestic arrivals. If Birmingham airport are operating Common Travel Area flights they should have a dedicated arrivals hall for this purpose or at least some sort of partition separating domestic passengers from international passengers instead of a flimsy swing door.,4,0
birmingham-airport,G Beard,United Kingdom,We travel regularly from this airport due to its proximity to home. The staff are consistently rude and unhelpful. It has fantastic transport links and ought to be the site for London's third airport but while it continues to provide some of the worst staff I have ever come across there is no chance. I am ashamed to be British when I see their treatment of passengers. Do the owners not wish to improve the place? Go and visit any other world airport and see what good service and helpful staff can do.,1,0
birmingham-airport,Keith Cooper,United Kingdom,This airport can not handle the large number of passengers for Emirates and other busy flights and is a disgrace Thursday the 13th Nov it took us an hour just to walk up the ramp to reach the security desks. We just made it to the gate on time and there were still 40 passengers waiting to clear the security queue at the time of departure. The management if there is one need to visit Dubai to see a proper airport functioning. The duty free/food outlets at Birmingham are wasting their time being there at peak times as there is no time to use them Emirates should give up on this third rate airport.,,0
birmingham-airport,T Flanagan,United Kingdom,I travel from this airport a lot and it amazes me how moody and aggressive airport staff are and on arriving at there is always a longer than usual wait to vacate the plane a wait for stairs or buses to arrive and a massive wait for luggage. Its not a nice experience flying into or from Birmingham.,,0
birmingham-airport,Steve Morton,United Kingdom,Being a local living just 15 mins from this airport I am ashamed by the consistently shoddy customer service. Arriving back from Faro yesterday I watched the bags being taken off before we disembarked it was raining but the handlers did not bother to use the covers on the baggage trucks and just dumped bags on without any care whatsoever. It took fully 50 minutes for the first bags to arrive on the carousel and my bags was absolutely saturated when I unpacked at home most of the clothing inside was damp or wet. I also had a set of golf clubs that had to be collected from the oversize baggage carousel and these were also dripping with water although thankfully in a hard case. In the 'drop and go' car park there are no sheltered areas so you just get wet if its raining. My taxi driver was not impressed putting my dripping wet luggage into his car! Also why do charge £1 for luggage trolley? I've never been to any other airport that does this yet another way to make money from the customer!,,0
birmingham-airport,C O'Hanlon,United Kingdom,BHX-CDG-BHX. Another excellent experience of Birmingham Airport for this short hop to Paris. Checked in online and got dropped off at Birmingham Int'l railway station (to avoid the short stay parking charges) and was through security in about 20 minutes which included having my bag searched. Had a delicious lunch in one of the restaurants and still had time to have a browse around the many shops. Air France ground crew were efficient loading the plane and we were away on time. The return was even less eventful. Off the plane and through immigration within 10 minutes (using the automated passport gates). I didn't have any hold luggage so I was on the small train back to the railway station within 15 minutes of getting off the plane. A great airport which does everything I need it to.,10,1
birmingham-airport,R Lewis,Spain,Collection of baggage is far too long over 45 minutes to wait for the luggage to appear no good if you have an ongoing connection.,,0
birmingham-airport,David Woodall,United Kingdom,Worst airport in the country. Always have to wait for the stairs to get off the plane. They are never ready for the plane to land. Last time landed at 11.10 from Alicante still on the plane at 11.30 got off the plane and had to wait for 15 minutes until the buses finally left to take us to the Airport itself. Drove around for about 10 minutes in a circle to enter the airport about 30 yards from where the plane was before we got off it. Customs is a joke always add on 15 minutes for the Alton Towers style maze which leads you to a maximum of 3 customs officers and if you do decide to use the automated Passport recognition facility good luck!,,0
birmingham-airport,D Earl,United Kingdom,Living in Devon we thought we would try Birmingham instead of our usual departure airport Gatwick. Check in for our flight to Orlando was quick and stress free and was security. Enjoyable browsing in departures before our flight was called and boarded 15 minutes early. Regrettably not such a pleasant experience on the return leg. After landing we had a 20 minute wait for steps. 5 minute wait through immigration. but then a 40 minute wait for our luggage. After a long flight home the last thing you want are delays on the ground looking at other reviews this looks like a recurring problem that needs sorting out. Looks like back to Gatwick next year.,5,0
birmingham-airport,Justin Musgrove,United Kingdom,Waiting 15 minutes to get off plane waiting half an hour to get through passport control currently been waiting over an hour for our bags from the carousel. This airport is a disgrace.,,0
birmingham-airport,A Barrett,United Kingdom,In the past 12 months we have flown from the airport twice. The queues both times have been horrendous. 18 Sept we arrived 2 hours before take off it took us that long to go through security passport control etc we only had time to grab a very horrible packet sandwich from Boots to take on the plane with us. We had planned on eating at one of the food outlets but there wasn't even time for us to visit the toilets before going to the gate! There was not time to buy anything (other than the sandwich) sit down catch our breath. It was very stressful and got our otherwise enjoyable holiday off to a very bad start. There was an express queue which costs £3 per person this is not the answer the queues for everyone need to be addressed. The automated gates would also not work and when I went to the only person I could see to help at the Express queue he told me I would have to wait as the £3 people take priority. This was very rude and so I told him it wasn't my fault the machines were not user friendly. We usually travel at least once a year from B'ham but we are seriously considering looking at East Mids or Manchester first now. Sorry please improve the experience for everyone.,,0
birmingham-airport,H Reese,United Kingdom,This airport really is let down by it's baggage handlers. For the second time in as many months I've waited and waited for bag with no information and no reasoning given. Yesterday Monarch flight from Rome arrived at 13.20. Got through passport control to baggage hall at 13.40 and signs directed us to belt 7. Nothing happened for 10 minutes. then the belt started. No bags came out for several minutes then 10 appeared. These ten went round and around with no one claiming them for another 10 minutes before another 8 bags came out. Over 100 people standing staring at the same 18 bags going around and around for 45 mins before the rest appeared. There was no information no one at the information counter. All of the bags were on the same flight. They all get unloaded on a big trailer. There can be no good reason for a handful to be delivered to the belt at a time. Either they are all there or they aren't. While this was happening 6 other flights all of which landed after ours received their luggage. The system does not work.,5,1
birmingham-airport,N Maybanks,United Kingdom,Having used BHX as airport of choice for many business trips without hassle I was disappointed when landing on 1/9/14 that the airport was hugely understaffed from a baggage handling point of view (we were told just 3 staff for the whole terminal). To set the scene landed at 00.30 from Ibiza (Monarch flight 10 mins early) into baggage claim 00.45 (2 young children in tow) 2am still no baggage. We're told over PA that due to staff shortages we can wait an unknown period of time for our bag or it will be couriered to us within 7 days. Like I said earlier we have 2 young children it approx 2 am and our booked taxi is threatening to leave us for another booking. At this stage we left the airport thinking our luggage will be delivered in good faith as promised but no due to the baggage handling debacle BHX called the next day for us to return to the airport (45 mins each way) to collect our luggage. After many emails we begrudgingly collected our luggage along with an hours wait.,3,0
birmingham-airport,H Reese,United Kingdom,For a small airport Birmingham is excellent. It has great transport links good facilities and check in and security has always been hassle free. Everything is easy to find and nothing is too far to walk to. What lets it down is the baggage handlers and ground staff. I travel through this airport a couple of times a year and every time have sat waiting on the plane for steps to arrive so we can get off or for buses to take us to the terminal. Baggage delivery is the worst I've ever experienced. The most recent flight we were waiting almost an hour after 3 bags came through and then nothing for over 45 minutes!,7,1
birmingham-airport,Mike Robinson,United Kingdom,"Arrived at the Air France check in after surprising my wife with a trip to Paris for our Pearl wedding anniversary. The good mood we were in soon evaporated after being confronted by the woman on the check in desk. The crime we had committed was not to use the self check system. The facial expressions she used were akin to someone chewing a wasp! With us both not being frequent fliers we thought we could go to her for help to say her demeanour was hostile was understatement  I explained that we hadn't used the system before to a surly reply of ""there's always a first time"". Well this is the first and last time I will be using Birmingham Airport.",,0
birmingham-airport,R White,United Kingdom,As a brum resident I regularly use this airport for short flights to the continent. Most recently was back in April for a short flight to Hanover. The airport really needs to work with the train operators to get 24 hour train services put on as for the number of early morning flights the public transport provision to the airport is very poor. There were no real glaring issues with check-in although whenever I've used the self check-in machines they have frustrated the hell out of me! They simply don't work and I've had to use the desks as a result to get my boarding pass. The departures process is not too bad compared to other airports. My only gripe with this airport is that it's departure lounge is a bit of a joke. Its a bit claustrophobic and cluttered. I wouldn't really want to be stuck here for more than 2 hours.,7,1
birmingham-airport,P Welsh,United Kingdom,After a 2 hour delay by Flybe on Sat 31st May with no explanation we were delayed getting off the plane for another 20 mins and then to round it all off nicely we had an 3/4 hour delay for baggage with no information about what was happening and not a soul in sight to ask. Returning on 16th June again with Flybe there was a delay in booking in baggage and I found the personnel very brusque by the time I got through security I had to rush to the gate with no time to stop and browse if I'd wanted to. Birmingham airport really need to get their act together in future I will travel to East Midlands.,,0
birmingham-airport,Shirley Norman,United Kingdom,Arriving at 1.18pm on Friday 23rd May - 10min or more wait for steps to be brought to the aircraft for us to get off the plane then over 1 hour wait for baggage to arrive in the baggage hall. No information and no one around to ask what was going on It seems Menzies do not know what they are doing. Will think twice about using BHX in future unless they get their act together.,3,0
birmingham-airport,H Burden,United Kingdom,Friday 23 May horrendous problems on baggage claim from Malaga. Carousel 6 was allegedly selected and when we got there the hall was heaving. Passengers on flights from Frankfurt Rome and Brussels were still waiting for their luggage to arrive and some ha already been there over an hour and a half. We then waited for an hour no officials could be found baggage reclaim desk had not been told of the problem and they had requested the attendance of managers from BHX and the handling agent but no one appeared. No announcements were made until eventually we were told by a member of staff that the. Malaga luggage was coming in on another carousel in a different part of the building. Some people had taxis waiting and had to pay huge extra costs but were being stonewalled when they asked for some form of compensation. The whole situation was unacceptable And badly handled. This is not the first time I have had problems with baggage handling issues at BHX and serious lack of communication.,5,1
birmingham-airport,George Barron,United Kingdom,If you are flying to Corfu on a Friday morning with Thomson Airways arrive in plenty of time to do the check in. The problem we found was that the handling agent were unable to control the situation. At the same time to check in there is an Eastern Airways flight to New York and countless passengers were overweight in their baggage the Agent allowed these pax to unpack their cases at the check in desk to get down to the allowed limit. We saw many people taking clothes out and then wearing extra shirts jumpers jackets etc this took so long by these people in front of us. A complete failing by the Agent where the Supervisors and or Station Manager must have been sleeping. It wasn't funny to arrive in plenty time then experienced the situation to be the last two people to board our flight. You have been warned.,5,1
birmingham-airport,P Collins,United Kingdom,Arrived back in Birmingham in the early hours of Sunday morning 11th April 2014 on a Thomson flight from Paphos. The walk from the aircraft to the airport custom control was horrendous such a long distance and as I have walking difficulties this added to the problem. I was not offered assistance or told of how long the walk was going to be which was very bad customer service. Surely when improvements to the airport are being made contingencies of walking stairways should have been considered.,3,1
birmingham-airport,John Dearing,United Kingdom,There was an unacceptable delay in delivering baggage from flight to terminal at Birmingham Airport on Sunday 20th April 2014. Flight BE 9012 from Geneva landed at Birmingham at 14.05 having made up 20 minutes after a delay in Geneva but the baggage was not delivered to the baggage hall until 15.20 more than one hour after we disembarked from the aircraft. This was an absolutely unacceptable wait and certainly the longest I have endured in forty years of leisure and business flying around the world. Worringly the personnel at the baggage enquires desk were unable to explain the reasons for the delay and suggested that this was a common occurrence on Sundays. The sound quality of 2-3 messages delivered on the PA system in the hall was inadequate to gain any sense of their meaning. There was only limited seating available.,,0
birmingham-airport,Giannicola Bonora,Italy,"As nobody has recently updated BHX reviews I just want to say that the area of former Terminal 2 has been renewed at last. The disposed the old worn out and smelly carpets on the floor and on the walls and now there is a brand new wooden floor and anonymous but clean white wooden walls. The area still has minimal services compared to the main departures area but is less depressing than it was before and the dedicated duty-free area is adequate. Only one warning throughout the main departures area you are lured to go to ""gates 1-9 for food and drinks"" but once you are there (the former terminal 2 area) you only find a cafeteria with coffee and sweet pastries (excellent by the way). So if you are meant for a ""serious"" breakfast you are better off if you stop before going to your departure gate.",8,1
birmingham-airport,D Judge,United Kingdom,I have just returned from my first air travel following a debilitating stroke and was very apprehensive on a number of levels I was very impressed and greatly relieved by the care and attention I received. The check in staff and the disability support team could not have done more for me when l first arrived at the airport and when we landed back in the UK. I would like to thank them all for a very positive experience which has given me the confidence to consider air travel again.,10,1
birmingham-airport,G Sparkes,United Kingdom,Only had to drop our bags off at check in on 26th February at 10am with Thomas Cook going to Fuerteventura. Easy? That's what we thought. 4 senior citizens off on a winters break. First problem. Miserable check-in woman. Second problem we were allowed 15 kg each hold luggage and 5 kg each cabin luggage a total of 80 kg. We actually had 63 kg in total but the jobsworth at check in deemed that 3 cases had 1 kg too much and made us unpack a case and put 3 kg in to our one and only hand baggage. This made that case 2 kg overweight? This humiliation in front of a gigantic queue. We fly 3 times a year to the USA always from Manchester. Now I remember why we fly from Manchester and not Birmingham. Pleasant sensible efficient staff. I am Birmingham born and bred but I am ashamed of Birmingham Airport. Never again.,,0
birmingham-airport,Stuart Ward,United Kingdom,Flight out 24/2 07.10 back 26/2 17.45. Both ways fairly uneventful 7 minutes to get through security going out and coming back luggage arrived on the carousel after a 10 minute wait. So yes it was a good experience.,8,1
birmingham-airport,Tim Ricketts,United Kingdom,We recently flew from BHX very early in the morning so everything went smoothly. However the return to BHX went very smoothly until we got to the baggage hall. Our flybe flight got into the airport 40 minutes earlier than expected. I fly all over the world and have never experienced such an inefficient crew of baggage handlers. We must have waited 50 minutes for the bags to come through. This is not the first time in fact it is every time I fly into BHX. Why do we have to put up with these baggage handlers. In Germany or other UK airports generally the bags are on the carousel when you enter the baggage hall. So why cannot BHX get there act together. I could fly into the MAN or EMA get my bags and drive the hour by the time BHX have the bags off the plane.,3,0
birmingham-airport,John Spencer,United Kingdom,Easy to be trapped into paying way over the odds on the Drop Off Parking staff in the terminal quite off hand and don't seem to recognise that passengers actually provide employment for them. Won't use this airport in future.,2,0
birmingham-airport,G McLaughlin,United Kingdom,Power cut at the check-in so I went inside to assist my wife who was travelling alone so I was parked in the drop off. Unfortunately I was charged £17 because I stayed more than half an hour but still within an hour (because of the power cut). Inside the Terminal staff very sharp and put up an aggressive front when there was absolutely no need. I agree they have to stand up for themselves when passengers become abusive but everybody was patient and understanding but the staff still very abrupt! I live locally but will fly from London if I'm going abroad. Check in staff don't have any pleasant manners about them either a standard that's certainly declined.,1,0
birmingham-airport,Raymond Gorman,Spain,I like Birmingham Airport as generally I have never had any problems when flying with any other airline but Ryanair. This time Jan 6th check in did not call through about my disabled wife and we had problems getting to our plane in fact we had been forgotten and we were the last one at a mad dash. Needs a moving stairway to planes urgently and I am absolutely disgusted with the £2 charge for trolleys. I have flown all round the world in my time and never had to charge for this service especially considering the price of the drinks and food in the airport may switch to East Midlands.,7,1
birmingham-airport,D Soni,United Kingdom,I refuse to fly from Birmingham even though I live in the area Terrible airport from start to finish I think its extortionate when they charge for trolleys Parking in the drop off zone is horrendous and again nothing short of a rip off The duty free shops has be the worst in the UK staff haven't got a clue about customer service I recommend highly avoid whenever possible.,,0
birmingham-airport,J Bowen,United Kingdom,We were flying to Heraklion from Birmingham on Sunday 15th September upon arrival the check-in queue was horrendous it took us nearly an hour and a half to get to the check in desk and only then as we were pulled out of the queue because our flight was about to board. After and hour and a half drive to get there cannot believe it took the same amount of time to check-in. No time to get breakfast drink anything as the flight was boarding. Upon our return guess what it took over and hour from landing to get our luggage. What is the matter Birmingham a tiny airport in Crete turns it round in a quarter of the time. This is the second time now this has happened at Birmingham won't be going there again. They have all this fancy scanning at passport control and can't do a simple job like getting the luggage through. We had always chosen Birmingham over Bristol (when we live in Bristol) but not any more.,,0
birmingham-airport,J Prior,United Kingdom,Travelled through BHX to RHO on a Saturday recently. Check-in was efficient and polite. Had free fast-track security with lounge pass which was great as only 5 people in front of us. Lounge will be reviewed separately. What really annoys me is there do not seem to be enough airbridges so there is a trek down lots of stairs to get to aircraft. Added to that is the walking distance to some of the gates even younger passengers were out of breath. Why did BHX not install a moving walkway when building the International Pier. Same thing happened on return. Not connected to airbridge parked close to arrivals door but then long trek to passport control. Thankfully lots of stairs avoided by using lifts but again a moving walkway would have eased the problem. Same old problem with waiting time for baggage although 3 flights had arrived around the same time it still took 45 minutes for our bags to appear.,5,1
birmingham-airport,D Vernon,United Kingdom,Security queues would be shorter if they weren't making up their own rules about what can be in hand luggage and pulling over people for items OK in every other airport I've been through in the US and Europe.,,0
birmingham-airport,P Cairnduff,United Kingdom,I was a bit gobsmacked when flying out on a Sunday afternoon when I saw the length of the security queue which stretched right round the perimeter of the landside departures area but extremely impressed by how well it was managed by cheerful and committed staff - only 25 minutes to get through - now that's efficiency at its best! The departure lounge is good in terms of the facilities it offers but I always hate the lack of windows in this part of the airport - it's amazing when you head out to the boarding gates the difference made by the light from outside coming in! Feel the UK arrivals terminal could be better staffed - passengers should not have to wait for doors to be opened but baggage claim is generally quick enough car hire pick up is a short walk from the terminal and the location means you can be on several major motorways in minutes - so all in all a pretty good airport.,7,1
birmingham-airport,Brian Steene,Bahrain,This is the last time I shall fly to Birmingham. I will use Heathrow from now on. There can be no excuse for the length of time it takes to receive baggage at this airport. Toilets are a disgrace. This is utterly unacceptable in this day and age. And to charge for trolleys is the final nail in the coffin.,,0
birmingham-airport,Paul Drinkwater,United Kingdom,Security at BHX probably the longest wait for security checks in the world has been like it for at least 18 months. Useless management always give excuses never try to rectify the major problem. Awful situation. they always say its a busy time of the day for flights! Get real its an airport what do you expect?,,0
birmingham-airport,T Kenneth,United Kingdom,"The security queues are consistently some of the worse I have encountered but now this seems to have spread to check-in too. Flybe one of the biggest airlines in terms of routes from Birmingham have introduced a chaotic ""self-luggage weighing"" system. It's the airport equivalent of self-scan tills at supermarkets where they constantly tell you to seek assistance and there is no-one free to assist. When we finally got assistance we were told we could not use the system as we were travelling with an infant (wrong we had a child) and had to go to the back of the standard check-in queue! The check-in queue was full of people like us who had already checked in and just needed to drop bags but were no doubt unwilling or unable to take a chance on the self weighing option. Tempers were fraying all over as people weren't clear which queue to join.",2,0
birmingham-airport,D Jones,Spain,Credit where credit is due. I have often criticised this airport for the appalling queues for immigration and security checks and also luggage delivery waiting times. However I arrived there on a Friday in April and the passport control queue was fairly quick (Emirates landed after us) and I prepared for the long wait for luggage to appear. On this occasion the luggage appeared in about 10 minutes that must be a record for BHX. Perhaps they have taken on board the countless critical remarks and are now heading in the right direction.,8,1
birmingham-airport,Z H Myklebust,South Africa,I recently arrived at BHX knowing that the baggage trolleys come at a price which I was not prepared to pay. I am a small person but somehow managed my 52 kgs of luggage on my own! The priority baggage handling of Business class was a huge bonus as I recall my baggage collection in Economy taking far too long last year. My cup of coffee at BHX departure cost me £2.50. I was very fortunate to get Express check in which greatly reduced the Security queuing time. I am unsure whether to recommend this airport in view of cost factors.,5,1
birmingham-airport,Sarah Bennett,United Kingdom,Please make sure you are aware it costs £1 to just drop off passengers and for 25 minutes to pick up passengers is a staggering £7. Not impressed with the conditions of the toilets. Trolleys are £1 to use. Trolley staff rude and unhelpful. A rip off airport make sure you have a spare £20 just to walk out of the building! Final note bring food all food is over priced.,1,0
birmingham-airport,Jonathan Ryan,United Kingdom,I have travelled through many airports around the world. While I accept that the management is focused on profit maximisation at the expense of customer satisfaction I do wonder why they are unable to get even the basics right - ie the toilets. The gents toilets are without doubt some of the dirtiest and smelliest airport facilities that I have encountered. (Only one airport in Africa (in Angola) and another in a certain Middle Eastern country compare with the BHX experience). Let us hope that the disillusioned management one day come to their senses as BHX does have the potential to be a proper international airport. For the moment though its management are very successful in portraying it as a regional second rate hub through which many people have no choice but to pass.,2,0
birmingham-airport,Richard Ormson,United Kingdom,Over an hour to get through security on 8th April - that's enough to put me off ever using this airport again. Having only two security lanes open at peak time is completely ridiculous. There were plenty of staff around to manage the queue but if half of them had been put to running the scanners there wouldn't have been a queue that needed managing. If you ever do make it to the departure lounge there is a good range of shops and places to eat. They were almost completely empty when I got there (presumably everyone was spending so long waiting for security they then had to go straight to their planes).,,0
birmingham-airport,Kevin Tunnicliffe,United Kingdom,Returning to BHX on 19th January having been diverted to Glasgow the previous evening we were whisked through immigration having undergone this process at Glasgow the night before. Baggage was extremely slow coming off the belt the first pieces almost 50 minutes after disembarking the plane. Going through customs we were surprised and more than a little annoyed to see passengers stopped and made to produce passports and undergo scrutiny even though we had all cleared customs in Glasgow. Pretty disgusted at this abuse of power.,5,1
birmingham-airport,Kevin Tunnicliffe,United Kingdom,Quick passage through security today which makes a nice change. Duty free boasting 40% sale but frankly the prices seemed no different.,10,1
birmingham-airport,John Lofthouse,United Kingdom,I live in Birmingham and have used the airport on dozens of occasions and I have come to loathe it intensely to the point now where I happily travel 45 mins to East Midlands rather than 20 mins to Birmingham. I travel a lot around Europe and the occasional long haul and I can honestly say that Birmingham is one if not the worst airport I have ever had to suffer. The baggage handling is appalling the security staff are borderline rude and utterly obstructive and the worst of all is the endless queues through immigration on returning from any non-EU country. I am not exaggerating when I say I have never managed less than a 20 minute wait to get through immigration and it's particularly galling when each time only 5 desks out of the ten available are ever manned with a queue going way beyond even the endless snake.,,0
birmingham-airport,J Prior,United Kingdom,"Used BHX during past 2 weeks and wish there was some continuity at security. Despite having used the same plastic bag for a number of recent flights it was suddenly too big. When I was given the smaller regulation one all I did was fold over top of mine and put it into smaller one. Thankful I wasn't sent back to machine to purchase the ""proper"" bags as queue through security was horrendous. Majority of security staff are very helpful. Baggage handling still poor waited over 40 minutes before first bag appeared and flight arrival info not cleared from baggage hall screens when it's obvious all the bags have been collected. If you've got 5-6 flights all arriving between 2300-2330 then it's sensible to have enough baggage handlers to cope.",5,1
birmingham-airport,Kevin Tunnicliffe,United Kingdom,"The experiences of departing and arriving at Birmingham were quite different. Departing was a bit of a nightmare. Even with fast track the queues were slow and security staff picky and pedantic. Belt shoes and so forth removed they seemed to be checking almost all hand luggage which slowed the security process down considerably. We were told this was so that this was so the process looked fair and they could not be accused of picking on certain profile groups and subjects. Snaking through the expensive ""Duty Free"" area is a pain as it prolongs the journey through to departures. On the other hand we landed about 40 minutes behind schedule but the e-gates were empty and we were through in seconds (lines for the traditional passport control were pretty full). Baggage on the carousel within a couple of minutes and we were on the road about 35 minutes after landing which is pretty good by any standards. My scoring is an average of the low score for departures and an excellent score for arrivals.",6,1
birmingham-airport,J Peart,Finland,Overall good experience. However having to pay for luggage trolleys and bags for holding liquids is just over the top. The route from security check funnels passengers through the middle of a duty free shop. In my opinion the airport owners are just trying their hardest to squeeze every last penny out of the users of the facility.,5,1
birmingham-airport,J Orme,United Kingdom,I wish other travellers would just think about what they bring in to security! I travel thorough Birmingham every three weeks and I have to wait in Security because others have over sized liquids in their bags. Or the I follow the passenger through the metal detector who forgets to take their phone out of their pocket and says sorry! It is too late the queue has built up by then. I like the airport the service and the shops. It is passengers who cause most of the queues.,8,1
birmingham-airport,Chris O'Hanlon,United Kingdom,Another easy departure and arrival at BHX. Got dropped at the railway station and there was no queue at check in. Only slight gripe is that even though BHX operates as one terminal the Flybe / Air France check in desks are still located in the Eurohub building which is separate from the rest of the check in facilities and involved a fair walk past the Arrivals area. On the plus side you can access the new security area from either side of the check in area and the queue from the old Eurohub building is definitely shorter. Departure lounge has a reasonable selection of High Street outlets and some decent restaurants. On arrival I was through immigration and at the railway station within 10 minutes of landing.,9,1
birmingham-airport,G Bunn,United Kingdom,Last time I arrived the queue for passport control filled the hall and passengers were sent down in batches from the upper level. The escalator was turned off leaving only the stairs in use. It took almost one hour to get to the desk. BHX was a good airport but I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.,1,0
birmingham-airport,Linda Peplow,United Kingdom,Worst airport in the world for seating before going through to departure. Not everyone can arrive just before check in and I don't see why I should have to constantly buy coffee just to sit. I didn't find any other seats before going through to departures.,5,0
birmingham-airport,Chris O'Hanlon,United Kingdom,I always find BHX a breeze. Large check-in area and the new security area is much improved on the old one. Maybe I have been lucky with queues but I've never had to wait more than about 15 minutes to get through security. Once through there is a good choice of bars and shops and the new International Pier offers a great view of the apron with loads of seating. On return the new immigration booths assist with the queues particularly for UK passport holders and on my last two occasions I have been out of the airport within 20 minutes of landing. I agree with the comments on the charges for the drop off area so now I always get dropped off at Birmingham Int'l railway station which is free for 20 minutes and take the Maglev train to the terminal.,8,1
birmingham-airport,R Hale,United Kingdom,BHX used to be a superb airport to fly to and from. Not any more. On the way out to Dalaman we were caught in a quite ridiculous queue for security which looped from the escalator right the way round the first floor shopping area and then along the passage way eventually and after a few more loops into the security area. So despite arriving 2 hours before departure we had limited time in the departure lounge before our flight was called. On return at about 23.25 a week later I was kept waiting about 45 minutes for our luggage. I then had an unpleasant walk in the rain to the far side of the long stay car park as the shuttle bus service becomes almost non-existent by late evening and is totally inadequate when several flights arrive at the same time. I then had to return to the drop off car park to pick up some luggage and passengers; I was there for a little over 10 minutes - enough to for the parking charge to click up from £1 to £2. BHX - if you are going to accept several flights together late in the evening - please retain enough staff to cope. A couple of years ago I would have been pleased to give a total satisfaction score of 9 or 10 for this airport.,2,0
birmingham-airport,R Waller,United Kingdom,The airport is clearly focusing on short term financial performance at the expense of passenger experience. As has been mentioned elsewhere the cost of changing currency through Amex and the drop off charges are ridiculous and they even seem to have stopped picking up litter to save money.,5,0
birmingham-airport,William Cannon,United Kingdom,Queuing times for security would be considerably decreased if passengers fully complied with the security procedure. Instead many passengers totally disregard the procedure and this results in their bag being pulled over for search. This not only delays them but also other passengers in the queue behind them.,8,1
birmingham-airport,J Prior,United Kingdom,My boss travelled BHX-GLA-BHX 15/16 May. On his return to BHX it was 20 minutes before he left the aircraft and a further 35 minutes waiting for baggage. There was no-one to operate the airbridge then Menzies Handling employee had to get a code to open door into baggage hall. After 15 minutes standing at non-moving conveyor belt request was made for information on whereabouts of baggage. Eventually it started to appear after 35 minutes of waiting. Reason for delay was - we've had a lot of planes arriving. It's barely a month into the holiday season and already we have the familiar problem at Birmingham which seems to be their ability to cope with baggage delivery. My boss was not impressed!,4,1
birmingham-airport,Ian Arnold,United Kingdom,2 points to raise firstly BHX now uses American Express for bureau de change and I find them prohibitively expensive. Secondly on flights arriving late at night the airport authorities insist on using remote stands and bussing people to the main terminal which adds and extra half hour to getting out of the airport. This is the 4th time I have landed there late at night using different airlines and every time its a remote stand and a bus!,5,1
birmingham-airport,M Carter,United Kingdom,Unfortunately I have to use Birmingham Airport to fly to the Channel Islands to visit my family. I nearly always find the security staff are the worst in the world. If possible I travel from Heathrow. On 12th April I had intended to be at the airport an hour before departure but due to late arrival of a train I only just made it 30 minutes before my flight was due to leave. I was told I should have been there 2 hours before departure - I have never had to for the Channel Islands and I have in my procession a print out saying 30 mins before departure. They emptied my bag all over the place then stuffed everything back in. An extremely nice lady helped me to calm down and I was offered a voucher for a drink onboard. Very bad security staff here and I am 70yrs old - horrible experience.,1,0
birmingham-airport,J Kirby,United Kingdom,Travelling out from airport was ok although object to drop off parking charges made for such a short period of time (£1 for 10 mins) which isn't long enough. Makes it a very rushed start to any holiday. Return experience was even worse. Don't the staff check when flights are due in? We returned on a daily flight from Dubai but there were no trolleys at the pay station. There seems to be an air of indifference to the needs of the traveller and an unfortunate end to an otherwise wonderful holiday. Come on Birmingham stop being so money grabbing and start to think about your customer service. The two don't match!,4,1
birmingham-airport,Ann Salmon,United Kingdom,Went to Lanzarote on the 1st April from Birmingham everything fine except for the security part which was a nightmare. Queues were huge. Two girls in front had a bottle of pop which obviously couldn't go through the first bloke told them it couldn't the woman on the x-ray machine said it could and then surprise surprise their belongings were rejected. The bloke at the end then proceeded to spend 10 minutes explaining that they couldn't take it through and then walked the entire length of the hall to tip it out and give them back the empty bottle! It took us 35 minutes to get through. The joke being that there is a sign as you queue telling everyone how much better the new security arrangements are.,5,0
birmingham-airport,David Sullivan,United Kingdom,I've been a regular user of BHX for 20 years and unfortunately the last few have seen a marked deterioration in the experience. Security and border control are a particular problem. Margins are the main focus of management and if that drives away core customers (passengers and airlines) then it seems to be a question of so be it. Most other business airports I use regularly (LHR SVO IAH & AMS) have improved greatly in the last few years or at worst stayed the same. For me now the 40 minute time saving it offers me over LHR is becoming increasingly irrelevant.,3,0
birmingham-airport,A Mitchell,United Kingdom,I've travelled from MAN LHR LGW and BHX and I find BHX better than the others. It's easier to get through security checking in is less stressful. LGW is horrific for getting baggage but BHX is always much quicker. I do agree with the astronomical drop off and pick up charges! £1 for 10 mins! Least LGW is free!,8,1
birmingham-airport,S Bullas,United Kingdom,This is my nearest airport and unfortunately I am unimpressed. Birmingham leaves a lot to be desired despite the so called improvements. Its got rip off parking fees you have to pay for a luggage trolley and you don't get your money back. Coming through security you suddenly arrive in the midst of the 'duty free' shops. Why have they not included some mechanical walkways. Luggage takes quite a long time to come through on the carousels. One good thing about this airport is OCS who deal with passengers who need assistance they are brilliant and provide a wonderful service its a pity the same cant be said for the rest of the airport.,2,0
birmingham-airport,David Gartside,United Kingdom,Used BHX in preference to MAN for a trip to Denmark. Efficient - minimal queuing either on outbound security or inbound immigration. Luggage delivered speedily. Shops everywhere but that's just how many modern airports are I'm afraid. Quiet spaces can be found just beyond the shopping area. A lot less stressful than MAN and much cleaner.,8,1
birmingham-airport,W Beech,United Kingdom,Always the same ridiculous drop off and pickup charges it would not hurt having a couple of hours parking for a reasonable price. I might even use the airport cafe and spend a little more money on a coffee while I wait for the unexpectedly late plane. I may then not do everything I can to avoid this airport again.,1,0
birmingham-airport,S Casey,Australia,I arrived in the middle of the day and was able to use the scanner to get through immigration. No queue and I was done in less than 5 mins. Perfect after a long journey from Australia! The airport looked clean and of course one has to navigate through shiny duty-free shops just to get into the country but overall I found it much more pleasant than the busy Heathrow. Departure 4 weeks later was early (6 am) and the airport was getting busy when I arrived at 4.35am. However I got from passenger drop and through security in less than 30 minutes (having checked in online). Clearer signage would have saved me walking in a big circle to get to bag drop but when I got there it was quiet and the check-in agent was very friendly and helpful.,8,1
birmingham-airport,Stephen Jones,United Kingdom,Arrived back from Dubai on time 6.45 Sun evening and had to wait 1 hr 20 mins before the luggage came through. Servisair did nothing until people started to complain at their desk after an hour. It didn't help that I counted 6 uniformed Servisair personnel in the concourse standing around looking bored including 4 staff whose only job seemed to be to stand next to the belt watching us and occasionally removing a piece of luggage from a previous flight. After a 7 hour flight lands on time how can luggage take another 80 mins? Birmingham Airport leaves a very bad impression on passengers who have to endure such dreadful standards of service.,1,0
birmingham-airport,D Bingham,United Kingdom,Agree totally with previous posts regarding security travelled during mid term and it took 60 mins to clear security (3/10 desks open) while facilities are okay inside and prices are no more expensive than MAN/LBA/LGW I wouldn't use them again until they consider more appropriate staffing arrangements. If you are going to go fast track bear in mind this will only move you about 50% along the queue a queue you don't experience at MAN - the airport we will be going back to I am afraid.,3,0
birmingham-airport,M Boyd,United Kingdom,Birmingham is ok as an airport generally but why is everyone not outraged by the fact that there is now an option to pay for express security clearance at departures which is being forced on busy people by the long delays caused by the new layout which other reviewers have mentioned. A cynic would suggest that the long queues are a deliberate ploy to make more money from this scheme. Either way this is a total exploitative rip-off akin to the credit card booking fees charged by airlines and other on-line operators. Sort out the security process to make it quicker and less onerous for all customers please!,4,0
birmingham-airport,Emily Jones,United Kingdom,I did not think there was going to be a big queue at 4.30 in the morning yet there was. I thought Birmingham International were meant to have changed that yet I see no changes! On the other hand I thought the facilities offered at Birmingham were good plenty of places to eat plenty of shops with a good amount of toilets which is handy when you have young children. The internet was also very quick and handy.,7,1
birmingham-airport,J Prior,United Kingdom,"Travelled to Kos airport quiet for mid-morning. Everyone polite including security man who patiently searched hand luggage to locate scissors mistakenly packed. No long queues. Departure lounge is now one glorified shopping centre. Queues in WH Smith appalling whenever I travel from Birmingham 2 out of 5 tills open is just not good enough. Why have 2 shops with one dedicated to selling books only. Prices in ""duty free"" getting more expensive as we experienced in arrivals far better deals in supermarkets and on internet. Setting down/pick up time now reduced to 10 mins for £1 yet another money-making venture. Why does Birmingham Airport continue to bite the hand that feeds it? Baggage arrival slow but that's normal whatever time you arrive. Come on Birmingham get your act together you need to provide a better experience if you want to attract more airlines.",6,0
birmingham-airport,A Ward,United Kingdom,I returned from Ibiza and had to wait 45mins for my luggage from belt 4. The only downside to this is always a long wait for luggage. I queried the wait at the Servisair desk and they didn't seem too concerned. As for all the other facilities I have no complaints.,3,0
birmingham-airport,I Arnold,United Kingdom,Ryanair to Malaga return. Security check outbound was slow and took 45 mins to get through at 16.30 on a Sunday afternoon. On return immigration queues were awful and took exactly an hour to process through however at least baggage was on the belt. Food/drink prices are average airport prices now and terminal looks clean whenever I have passed through.,4,0
birmingham-airport,M Pillai,United Kingdom,This airport is awful. When I arrived back from a holiday it was around 7.45pm and it took an hour of waiting before all my baggage could be collected. My biggest problem is that they charge you £1 for a trolley to carry heavy suitcases. Every other airport I've been to around the world do not charge to use trolleys even the tiniest airports in Malaysia don't. At evening times the airport is poorly staffed and service is horrendous. It's quite clear when you walk around that a lot of money has gone to waste on stupid gimmicks.,1,0
birmingham-airport,G Failey,United Kingdom,Drop and Go charges as far as I am concerned as a fairly frequent visitor have been increased without much publicity resulting in a doubling of the minimum stay having been reduced from 15 to 10 mins. Even 15 mins is insufficient time to help people with disabilities elderly folk or unaccompanied young people resulting in making even a shortish stay an unwelcome expense. This adds no capital to the appreciation of an otherwise very good airport experience as a 'dropper-off' or as an air passenger.,4,0
birmingham-airport,Stuart Ward,United Kingdom,Scheduled Monarch flight to Almeria. I've been using BHX for about 30 yrs mainly for holiday flights. Pre Booked car park meant a short walk to check in hall check in was relatively painless  I was worried about the security queues but we went through in about 10 mins (Thursday midday) even the security operator mentioned about how quiet it was. It's like Manchester now as you have to fight your way through duty free but on the other side there's plenty of seats and shops/restaurants. There's no announcements of flight departures but plenty of screens telling you of progress so no problem. Overall it did what it promised yes prices in restaurants are higher but show me an airport that doesn't.,4,0
birmingham-airport,Kuldeep Singh,United States,This airport lacks basic amenities and the big one is the lack of water fountains. The authorities force you to buy expensive water plastic bottles. They also keep you in the shopping lounge for long time. Your gate is announced only 10 mins before the departure. The shopping lounge is crowded very loud with retailers playing loud music and the shops are extremely expensive.,1,0
birmingham-airport,Giannicola Bonora,Italy,"I think the ""one terminal"" revamp has fairly improved the overall departure experience from BIA especially for those once using terminal 2. The look now after security is that of a big modern airport more similar to Manchester Airport after the last refurbishment. Only disappointment is when realizing that the gates area of terminal 2 has been just ""connected"" not improved in any way. It is still the small dark depressing round area filled with extremely dusty carpets that it used to be. Only now the contrast with the rest of the airport is more evident. Can't say much about the queues because I usually depart on Sunday afternoons when the outbound traffic doesn't look predominant. Finally I will always support this airport at least for the excellent connection with a main railway line.",4,0
birmingham-shuttlesworth-airport,T Dokland,United States,Recent Improvements have made this small airport quite reasonable. There are a few dining and shopping options and the area is fairly large and pleasant. They still play terrible elevator music. Free internet is a bonus. The airport is conveniently located to the city but there is no public transportation available. Parking is $12/day bit it is often difficult to find a spot.,6,1
birmingham-shuttlesworth-airport,L Brown,United States,The airport has been and still under going renovations. The issues with no food past security have been fixed. The wait times are typically very short. Security can become long on Monday mornings but typically it is very quick as well. Walking distances to and from gates as well as to and from parking/car rental are rather short. There are no 1-2 miles walks to gates or otherwise. The biggest issue with the airport is the quality of staff at food outlets but that is not much different at a lot of airports. Overall it is a very good midsize airport.,9,1
birmingham-airport,Kevin Tunnicliffe,United Kingdom,Usually I am travelling Business Class with Emirates so after security it is straight to the lounge. This time we were travelling on a charter airline so had chance to look round and savour all the airport has to offer. Check in accomplished in less than 10 mins and security only 5 mins or so more. A breeze. We had no problem finding a choice of seating and settled into Wetherspoons for a beer and a coffee. Of course because it is an airport and they can the prices were way over the top. Choice of shops was good but prices were not a lot better if at all than on the High Street. Duty free in the UK seems to have gone downhill rapidly over recent years. Boarding was good and efficient with plenty of screens around to tell you about the flight so no worries about missing the boarding call. Very good. On return the immigration desks were well manned and we were through and into baggage reclaim in under ten minutes of getting off the plane. Luggage was starting to arrive onto the belt as we came through so that was excellent.,5,0
birmingham-airport,D Jones,Spain,Thought the improvements would make things better. Departing on Ryanair and everyone now passes through the same security area. The queues are as bad as before and this was at 05.30! When will the authorities at this airport take a good look at this area? Passengers should not have to queue for such a long time. Landed on Monarch and went though a ridiculous procedure of walking to a building going up stairs walking along a corridor and back down some stairs then back outside to the waiting bus - adjacent to the aircraft what was that all about!,3,0
birmingham-airport,Ian Arnold,United Kingdom,Flew from with Monarch to TFS. checked in within 10 minutes and dropped bags off. Processing to security took 15 minutes to get through. Past security I was surprised at the range of shops for a provincial airport - very good. Used the train to get to the airport from Cardiff and very quick and easy to do.,4,0
birmingham-airport,J Ross,United Kingdom,"Birmingham used to be a reasonably efficient 2 terminal operation but in the past months it has implemented ""improvements"" that have reduced security processing to a crawl (45 minutes on a normal Friday (not peak time!) - certainly the slowest I have encountered of the many UK airports I use. Lots of clever speaking cardboard models (but after 30 repeats of their greeting most people queuing would gratefully switch them off) but a dearth of security staff & open channels.",2,0
birmingham-shuttlesworth-airport,J Eduardo,United States,Poor airport overall. Limited food choices once past security. You are stuck with pizza or sandwiches no real sit down restaurants. Many of the food places close very early and start cleaning up the foods even earlier so you are out of luck if you get there too late. Only shops are Hudsons. I have been in smaller airports with much better facilities. Not very clean bathrooms were untidy and common area were just plain dirty benches with food spilled on them that sat for the entire 3 hours I waited for my flight. Not an airport I would ever want to be stuck in for an extended period.,2,0
birmingham-airport,B Whitaker,United Kingdom,I read the reviews with regard to security queues posted in October 2010. The position now is perhaps even worse. I travelled out of Birmingham in January and again in the first week of March. Each time we queued for about 45 minutes to get to the security screening. At 5.30 in the morning you don't expect to be greeted by any queues! I dread to think what the situation will be this Easter weekend or in the summer. The problem is easy to see and the designer of the security area wants sacking. You cannot pick up a tray until you get to the X-ray machines so there is no way to start preparing to remove liquids belt jewellery coat boots laptop coins and everything else that has to go in the tray. Hence the delay. Once through there are only a couple of tables and chairs so you struggle with the largest tray imaginable and have to sit on the floor to put everything back again. When will the airport authorities realise that they have made a huge mistake and address this problem. And don't even start me on charging to drop off airport users.,3,0
birmingham-airport,J Ryan,United Kingdom,"The prime objective seems to be revenue with no consideration for customer satisfaction. What other International airports charge £1 for drop off or for trolleys or have such dirty and toilets? But the biggest problem with this airport are the queues for security. They have always been a problem but have recently got worse with the ""upgrade"" and ""improved"" security screening facilities. On the 25th October there were 100's of people inconvenienced like myself and it took over an hour to go through the process. I questioned the reason for this with an airport representative and she said the problem was management and the way it is run. So paradoxically the security screening process ""improves"" but the passenger experience does not. I agree with this and there needs to be step change in management thinking to focus more on customer satisfaction. The obsessive focus on processes and the training they provide seem to turn the staff into ""jobsworths"" doing everything they can to discommode the paying public. So allow extra time to go through this Airport which offers a similar experience to many in the third world.",2,0
birmingham-airport,Paul Turner,United Kingdom,Birmingham to Dalaman from Terminal 1. Check in was fine but then we hit the queue for security. I have never seen anything like it. It took 1 hour to get through and not all the scanners were being used. For that reason alone I will avoid this airport if at all possible.,3,0
birmingham-airport,David Brown,United Kingdom,Beware travellers attempting to travel through BHX. This airport has succumbed to a lack of investment in people and equipment. Security is one of the worst manned and slowest there is out there. I now won't even think of turning up with 45 minutes before my flight with just hand luggage for an early morning flight. Even business class travellers beware the priority pass may save you having to queue around the food court and upper atrium but doesn't save you from the other queues once behind the 'security wall'. That said the departure lounge is very pleasant with plenty of choice for eating and drinking and not very long queues as most people have spent so long in security they have had to go straight to the gate. Coming back in to BHX you may have more luck occasionally the IRIS system is working in immigration and you can sail through (but I never seen it) and sometimes the queue at immigration is easy. However if you land just after a 777 from Asia expect to wait a long time. What you see on duty is what they have there seems to be no one in the wings ready to improve the flow. Unfortunately it's my local airport and has good connections around the world but I wouldn't recommend it. Oh and £1 for every 15 minutes just to pick up or drop off passengers.,1,0
birmingham-airport,A Marks,United Kingdom,I have flown from Birmingham Airport both european and middle east (UAE) flight on quite a regular basis over the last two year. Birmingham is a lovely airport not small but not huge. Every thing you need is there and the shops in departures are normal not just high end over priced clothes and hand bags! I've only had one 20 minute delay and airport staff have been great. The only gripe is the NCP parking on site although not the airports direct fault the website says its covered and a 2 minute walk to the terminal its open air and a 10-12 min walk at a brisk pace or 5 mins on the free bus (every 5-8 mins or so) still better then Heathrow or Gatwick.,5,0
birmingham-airport,G Gosall,United Kingdom,Excellent link between train station and airport meant I did not get ripped off for parking. I usually fly from T2 which I have always found to be excellent but due to upgrading work most flights are now departing from T1. As a result I arrived extra early to check-in etc and boy am I glad I did! The queue for the security line in T1 was a joke; it was snaking around the terminal past the shops and restaurants. For 40 minutes I shuffled through the line to the security desks where the staff themselves were complaining (quite loudly) that more desks needed to be open because they could barely cope with passenger numbers. Queuing to get hand luggage X-rayed was frustrating; passengers were lining up through a maze of channels just like when queuing for a ride in the theme park though this was infinitely less fun. Staff were constantly patrolling calling out for final call passengers. I don't think anyone was actually in control of the situation and it felt as though this was a regular occurance which staff have become accustomed to. On a positive note the staff I interacted with were calm polite and helpful. Departure lounge had the usual assortment of retail and coffee shops and the departure gates were close by. On the return trip my luggage arrived within 20 minutes of landing. I don't think I will fly from BHX until all the building works have been completed. At the moment T1 is totally overwhelmed.,3,0
birmingham-airport,A Walker,United Kingdom,Birmingham Airport seems to be going down the road of ripping customers off at every opportunity. Firstly you have to pay £1 just to drop someone off. They charge Â£3 per 15 minutes if you dare take more than 15 mins at the drop-off area. It used to be free but according to one of the police officers at the airport due to anti-terror measures the charges were brought in along with a new drop-off area. The airport luggage trollies cost £1 (you don't get your £1 back). The plastic bags cost £1 at the security point. Upon arrival at the airport baggage always takes about an hour to arrive in the baggage reclaim area and you are stung again for a £1 luggage trolley. My suitcase had its wheels damaged which meant we had no choice but to buy a luggage trolley. I will not be flying out of BHX again.,2,0
birmingham-airport,J Taverner,United Kingdom,I am biased and live 5 miles away. Security out was slow but immigration back from Palma yesterday was speedy. New terminal wing very pleasant. I cannot comment on park and ride The Emirates lounge is very plush.,5,0
birmingham-airport,J Hebberts,United Kingdom,I have used this airport for many years and service has declined in recent years to the point of being utterly appalling. The parking systems are a joke - you could not make them any more confusing if you tried. In particular I would like to congratulate those who designed and procured the barrier machines - they deserve a medal for disguising that all-important button so well (nice and small ambiguous symbol on it and surrounded with utterly bewildering information). On-site parking took so long due to the infrequency of buses that my wife reached the front of Check-In queue alone where staff insisted that she go to the back of the queue again (like a naughty child) rather than allow those behind to pass her. The liquids ban has given the airport yet another chance to sneak a few more pounds out of unsuspecting passengers by forcing those with cosmetics etc to purchase a quantity of 4 bags each in a useless plastic ball. Incidentally Drop-off costs a pound and even a luggage trolley requires a pound (non-refundable). The baggage reclaim on return took over an hour despite the airport being very quiet with no explanation of the delay other than 'operational difficulties'. Finally the long stay parking (operated by NCP) was also difficult to exit for prepaid customers and every single one of the 4 cars ahead of me struggled with the process for several minutes each - as I then did.,1,0
birmingham-airport,W McCafferty,United Kingdom,"Long stay car park 1 arrival and departure handling times were terrible. Security at Term 2 terrible queued for twenty five minutes just to get to scanners arrogant member of staff replied on being asked by a lady why such a long queue he stated that ""this is not a queue you should go to Term 1 to see what a queue is"" very helpful ! This with their various charges drop off trollies etc makes this the worse UK airport for me.",1,0
birmingham-airport,David Jones,United Kingdom,Not nice when arriving at terminal 2. If more than one plane lands at the same time you are forced to endure a claustrophobia inducing queue in a dark passageway to get to passport control. Terminal 1 is better but security queues can be very long. Passport control here is also bad especially if you arrive at the same time as the Emirates flight. I have often flown on Monarch and been kept waiting for and airbridge shuttle bus etc. Shops and facilities are ok.,3,0
birmingham-airport,Andrew Walters,United Kingdom,An airport where much is done to minimise cost meandering infrequent courtesy busses. and maximise retail opportunities ie they trap you in the shopping centre until your gate is called a windowless chaotic cell when pier is a much nicer place to sit. poor choice of food and snacks and only the normal high street shops but does not feel special. An airport that is good for healthy holiday makers and budget airlines but for frequent business travellers for those new to flying or not actually disabled but not comfortable on there feet for a couple of hours luggage hauling its not so good.,3,0
birmingham-airport,Nick Wilcock,United Kingdom,This used to be a very pleasant airport. But it has slipped in a couple of areas of late. The first impression if you use Long Term Car Park 1 is the bus to the terminals. This used to be for car park passengers only and it stopped at both terminals. Now it is for car park passenger 'set down' passengers using the free 15 minute option and airport staff. As a result it is slow and meanders its way through the car park before stopping at a point which still requires an open air walk to reach Terminal 2 departures. Quite why business travellers should be forced to share a bus with airport ramp workers is beyond me - no other airport mixes staff and passenger buses. The 'priority channel' at security causes resentment from passengers queuing in the 'normal' access - particularly when only 2 out of 5 checking lanes are available. Servisair lounge offers very little in the way of comfort food or beverages and the thumping music from the Tie Rack shop nearby is intrusive. On return the automatic passport readers are a plus - but then it all goes wrong again with the latest change to car parking. You can no longer pay in the terminal; instead you have to drive to the exit gate park pay in a draughty shed with only 2 machines (which do not have clear instructions for use) then back out into the oncoming traffic to drive to the exit lanes. Whoever came up with this stupid idea should go and visit other airports to see how car parking is managed!,4,0
birmingham-airport,Kevin Tunnicliffe,United Kingdom,They need to sort out the priority service for security. The entry is clearly marked but merges for the first check with the normal line which causes resentment amongst passengers who have had to queue. This is even worse when you get through to the screening. It could be though out a lot better. That said the screening was efficient and quick on our return our baggage came off the belt within a minute of getting to the reclaim hall and we were on our way home within 30 minutes of leaving the aircraft. Sort out the screening and the outrageous charges for dropping passengers off.,4,0
birmingham-airport,Paul Dixon,,This is a very handy airport for access to the Midlands (including Shakespeare Country) and Birmingham itself and in a pleasant location - only 80 minutes by train from London. The best transport option is the train which can whisk you to Birmingham New Street or Coventry in just over 10 minutes. Birmingham International Station can easily be reached from the airport concourse (upper level) by using a monorail system - the trip is some 2 minutes. In contrast the bus service is poor and many of the lines serving the airport do not operate on Sundays. Car access is easy from the A45 and well signposted; car parking is plentiful (both indoor and outdoor) but very expensive after the first 15 minutes. I used this airport this week (GRU/FRA/BHX and back) on arrival my wife and I cleared immigration easily and the immigration officer was very pleasant. The first shock however came soon after - a fee of 1 pound to get a trolley (change machines are available). Our departure was also OK except for the excessively strict security they confiscated my wife's skin moisturiser but at least did it with a smile. The airport has a good variety of shops and also food outlets. On the upper level near the shuttle station there is a good variety of restaurants (mostly on the expensive side) - you can even have good ol' Fish 'n' Chips in true British fashion while waiting for your flight. There are shops in the departure lounge too so if anything gets confiscated you can buy another one - just be sure it's under 100ml.,4,0
birmingham-airport,David Gartside,,Birmingham T1. Worked fine; good deal on weekend parking in short/medium stay car-park. £1 for trolley looks a bit grubby but several abandoned in car park so not a big deal. Check-in security airside departure lounge ok and much better than MAN. On return baggage retrieval efficient,4,0
birmingham-airport,K Botrell,,The special assistance area at Birmingham Airport is badly situated in the very busy & noisy check in area. There are often no seats available. The only disabled toilet nearby is often occupied by non disabled passengers or else nappy changing parents & it is often dirty. It was much better when it was upstairs in a quieter area with toilets nearby. My daughter is in a wheelchair & flies regularly from Birmingham. She always has a long wait to be collected from the plane or to be put on it & is often the last to get on! She had to wait over an hour to be disembarked last time & the pilots & crew were not happy as they were waiting to take off again. I'm not able to accompany her to the departure lounge & have to wait outside until I'm sure the plane has left without problem. In other EU countries its no problem to go through to the departure lounge & wait with them. Why is it not possible here? It is a terrible ordeal for her & for me but we cannot avoid it.,1,0
birmingham-airport,M Hyland,,I use BHX on a fairly regular basis and overall it is good. It is not that big and easy to navigate however you must make sure you have loads of time before your flight. The queue for security in terminal 1 can be massive at times and it can take over 30 minutes to get through. Once through there are a few shops leave plenty of time as there are always large queues in the newsagent and they seem to run out of newspapers by early afternoon. On arrival try and avoid arriving around 12.45 when you have Emirates Turkish and Turkmenistan arriving around the same time you can imagine the queue at passport control. Regarding the parking arrange to meet arrivals at the car hire roundabout which is a short walk away plenty of people do that. BHX have improved the luggage collection before you would have to wait an age but it is now much quicker. Terminal 2 is smaller than T1 and you are through in no time at all.,4,0
birmingham-airport,R Tremaine,,You get ripped of on arrival with their enforced £1 drop off fee then ripped off again when you want to use a trolley. You then stand in a long winding queue for ages to be met by surly security staff. I'm ashamed to say I live in Birmingham - I can only imagine what visitors must think particularly if they have the misfortune of using T2 departures - and I haven't mentioned the public conveniences with lights out ceiling tiles missing and cubicle doors broken.,1,0
birmingham-airport,Peter Cullen,,My first use of this airport since 2004 and I was pleasantly impressed it has improved since then. It started when I arrived at the long-stay car park which I had pre-booked to be told I had been 'upgraded' to medium term at no extra cost. So a two minute walk to the terminal. However note very carefully where you have parked if you use these car parks the numbering system is very confusing (at least to me) - I wrote it down correctly but it took me ages to find my car again on my return. As others have noted there are plenty of shops and cafes and also seating. If you arrive early you can use the viewing terrace free too. No major queues anywhere on departure or arrival a good experience.,5,0
birmingham-airport,J Russell,,"Smooth and easy transfer from train to the airport terminal buildings seem about the right size with good shopping facilities. Today's experience Flybe to Isle of Man from Terminal 2 however was just shockingly bad entirely down to an apparent complete lack of any control management or oversight of the security process. A security queue of 50 minutes only a single scanner operating the harassed staff clearly not in control of the situation and no-one managing them or the queue of whom most were on ""final call"" by the time they reached the front. Several passengers on the same flight as my own were rushed through security yet when I asked to join them I was told that the other passengers would be able to hold my plane and I should wait in line? When I finally reached the front of the queue the checkers had clearly hit a problem were arguing between themselves and not actually putting any bags through the scanners. Utter chaos.",3,0
birmingham-airport,William Read,,Arriving by train the airport is just a short (free at the moment) shuttle ride away which is one of BHX main plus points. This means that a passenger can avoid rip-off parking and disembarkation fees. Check-in was swift and efficient; in my experience the check-in staff do not concern themselves if your suitcase is a little overweight. The departure lounge is reasonably spacious with adequate seating and a wide range of shops. My main criticism is that on too many occasions passengers are bussed to or from their aircraft rather than being able to walk.,4,0
birmingham-airport,D Bokr,,I have just returned from BHX airport. The airport itself is nice and airy and plenty of places to eat. There are several hotels just outside the building within walking distance. Its easy to find your way around the building. However the majority of the staff at the airport are not that friendly. A smile seems too much of an effort. The airport security staff seem to have the biggest attitude problems. I realize they have a responsible job and take things seriously but I think it sometimes goes a bit too far. Instead of the 20 x 20 cm plastic freezer bag for carry on liquids I unfortunately had a 23 x 15 bag. (Who honestly measures this bag before packing?) I was scolded by a female staff member who obviously wasnt too happy at this time of the morning (0730) and was told to go over to a machine where I could purchase 4 plastic bags of the required size for GBP1. I wasn't alone there where several passengers being forced to do this. Strangely enough I had come through Frankfurt Hahn and Glasgow Airport prior to this and my plastic bag hadn't been a problem at all.,3,0
birmingham-airport,B Brewer,,I have just returned From Birmingham Airport having taken my wife to catch a flight. She regularly flies to various destinations around the world usually from Heathrow. I always stay with her until she goes through to security why wouldn't I? At Heathrow I have stayed for up to three hours and have never paid more than 10GBP. My less than one hour stop at Birmingham airport has just cost 17GBP. When I pick her up next week I'm going to drive around and around the roundabout until she calls to say she's outside the terminal building. Just to pick up will even cost a quid! Last time I was at Heathrow it was free to pick up. BHX certainly knows how to rip off it's customers.,1,0
birmingham-airport,David Walker,,ServiceAir Premium check in crew for EK were wonderfulg. Fast Track immigration for J passengers. Serviceair lounge was packed as EK put all their economy wheelchair passengers and families in their too. Boarding a nightmare as the flight to DXB was rather like the Polar Express and children wheelchair and J passengers all go in the same pen. On the whole its good to fly long distance from a local airport.,4,0
birmingham-airport,R Earl-Johnson,,Refreshingly the long stay parking is very near to the terminal. Check in/Immigration was speedy. Departure lounge was roomy with lots of shopping/catering choice. Me and my husband both agreed we would actively look for destinations from this airport again for weekend breaks.,5,0
birmingham-airport,Jenny Powles,,Birmingham Airport is awful for the disabled! My husband requires special assistance when we go on holiday due to his mobility difficulties. Every time without fail he falls through the cracks at some point. Birmingham (BHX) is not capable of providing a seamless special assistance service for the disabled traveller.,1,0
birmingham-airport,Colin Chadwick,,Get ripped off while you're dropped off! What other airports expect their customers to pay for the privilege of merely arriving at this airport? Avoid these charges by dropping off at Birmingham International rail station (next door) and taking the shuttle which takes you to the centre of the airport. Make arrangements to be picked up the same way on return.,3,0
birmingham-airport,Ray Woods,,Check in was a nightmare. It took us over 1 hour to check in. The main reason for the delay was that at check in if cases were even a tiny amount over weight they were forcing the mainly elderly passengers to re-pack from one case to another sending many to the back of the queue again and reaping a small fortune in excess luggage charges. The queue grew longer and longer with many passengers clearly distressed and nobody managing the situation. Eventually I asked for the supervisor and was pointed to a young man who had his head buried in a check in machine for 45 minutes - showing no proactivity in managing the situation. Generally prices to Malta are higher from Birmingham than elsewhere. Drop off zone is a rip-off.,2,0
bishkek-airport,David G Stein,United States,Simple clean and functional airport. Check in and security ws doe with ease. The food vendors are on the expensive side and do not accept credit cards. Seeing as most passengers rid themselves of local currency prior to leaving this presents as a problem.,5,1
bishkek-airport,S Odoca,United States,It is a small airport with standard facilities. Need more Jetways as most of the time the aircraft is forced to park far away from airport building. However the officers' attitudes in the CIQ area are amazingly modest compared to the ones from the other neighbouring Central Asian airports such as Almaty and Astana.,7,1
bishkek-airport,John Middleton,United Kingdom,Small functional airport. No frills. Arrived at about 3.30am from London. Not many passengers on the flight. Everything went smoothly and we were through immigration baggage and customs in no time. Once landside I realised my cell phone had fallen out of my pocket probably on the plane. A member of the BMI ground staff called the plane who found the phone and brought it to me. If arriving at Bishkek always make sure you are being collected at the airport by someone you trust and don't rely on taxis at the airport. Check in on the return trip at about 5.30 am was trouble free if a little slow on account of no online check in for my Turkish Airlines flight and painfully sluggish check in and security check staff. Travelled Business Class. Don't expect much from the BC lounge. Tired sandwiches and cake very limited choice of beverages and staff who were more interested in keeping up their conversation with each other to be bothered with the customers. Overall the airport did its job. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.,6,0
bishkek-airport,J Joshua,,"Overall the airport does the job and is an adequate small international hub but travellers beware of a dangerous scam by unregistered taxi drivers here. My driver was touting for custom with the rest of them as I came out of customs and immigration but turned out to be working with a fellow ""passenger"" who stopped the car between the airport and the city and extorted money from me to complete the journey. Two young men to one older man no contest here. Foolishly I only spotted the warning signs that the two of them were trouble too late and am grateful that it was only my pocket that was dented. Only ever take a registered taxi with the yellow taxi sign on top or better still have someone meet you. It sounds obvious but as most flights arrive here in the middle of the night it is possible to be caught out as I was.",3,0

blackpool-airport,J Parkinson,United Kingdom,Myself and husband have used Blackpool airport 6 times in the last 12 months - yes you pay £10 each departure tax but you can see nothing has been spent on the upkeep. I will still say we prefer going from Blackpool - there is less trouble and a lot less fuss. From landing and picking up our cases we can be home in an hour - we are very sad at its closing. We have just arrived home last night - we went from Blackpool put had to come back in to Manchester which we think is a nightmare - very sad customers.,8,1
blackpool-airport,Paul Cox,United Kingdom,Flew to Dublin yesterday (8th October) after catching train from Preston where I had been working for a few days to Squires Gate which is about a 10 minute walk. £10 ADF was a bit of a disappointment but check-in and security a breeze. Staff friendly and efficient. Depatures lounge was a bit old-fashioned (not necessarily a bad thing quite nostalgic really) but was very clean and the cafe was good. Aer Lingus as always a joy to travel with.,9,1
blackpool-airport,Helen Heron,United Kingdom,We have just returned from a trip to Tenerife with Jet2 and used Blackpool for the first time as the flight times from here were excellent. Yes it is only small but check in a security were swift with no problems encountered and adequate facilities for a drink and a little browse in the duty free. On our return again swift baggage claim and on the road home within half an hour. The only downside we arrived well before we were meant to and check in wasn't even open however the parking was a nightmare. We went right round the back to the overflow car park and only at the very last minute managed to squeeze on the end of someone else. I cant imagine what would have happened if wed left it later we would have missed our flight. Also it was a long walk to the terminal building and it was pouring with rain we were amazed their wasn't and easier way in to the building also our car on return was covered in dust from all the passing vehicles. This aside I would travel from here again as the good out weighs the bad but I really think you should assess the parking situation as this is very limited for the passengers travelling and is letting this airport down?,8,1
blackpool-airport,Alan Ormston,United Kingdom,Jet2 flight to Alicante in August 2014. After travelling to and from Venice in June I had Venice down as the worst airport in Europe but my experience in Blackpool proved it to be even worse than Venice! First of all parking is a nightmare parking in an unsecure field 15 mins walk from the terminal. You then enter the grubby check in hall (Jet2 check in quite efficient) pay the extortionate departure tax and spend the next hour in a breeze block corridor waiting for the rude and inefficient security staff. Finally you are allowed into what they laughingly name the departure hall to find that all the seats are taken. How long will Jet2 stay at this airport?,,0
blackpool-airport,K Mond,United Kingdom,"This place is the pits! Ever since they took over which is several years ago the owners impose an Airport Development Tax (ADT) of £10 per person. Yes if you are going to be back in less than 2 weeks it entitles you to ""free"" parking (how can a tax of £10 per head be free) on a quagmire at best with absolutely no security. The tax was allegedly to develop the airport (hence the name) but every cent of it goes into the pockets of the Directors. Not a single penny has been spent on improvements. The owners will argue that the place has been improved .... and it has. However the franchises that use the place (duty free cafe newsagents etc) all paid for the improvements so don't believe the owners. The place is also filthy and cold and when it rains they have to use buckets to collect rainwater. As for the security and check-in staff - the check-in staff turn up when they feel like it and the security staff are rude and surly and totally objectionable. Completely different to the pleasant and helpful staff at Manchester.",1,0
blackpool-airport,G Cameron,United Kingdom,Dreadful do not let your student sons and daughters fly home from Blackpool. My son had to scrape the £10 ADF fee from his pockets. He is a student with virtually no money and had no warning that he was going to need an extra Â£ £10! Very unfair and simply disgusting. I intend to complain to Jet2 about the airport they are using.,,0
blackpool-airport,C Knight,United Kingdom,I flew from Blackpool airport to Belfast for the first time I always fly from Liverpool to Belfast with Easyjet but the flight times were better and it was slightly cheaper to fly with Jet2 from Blackpool. I was expecting a small airport with limited facilities but nothing prepared me for the facilities here. Parking is free which was a bonus for me when booking on arrival however both car parks P1 and P2 were full and ended up abandoning my car on a grass area known as an overfill car park. This was a 10 minute walk to the airport. On arrival there was nothing before the departure lounge. The cash machine was out of service and WHSmiths closed. Paying the £10 airport charge was no problem and I was assisted with my baggage tag by a very helpful Jet2 worker. The worst experience was going through security where the staff were extremely rude not just with me but with an elderly couple in front of me. I agree that security needs to be strict but not intrusive and this was made a much more uncomfortable experience by the rudeness and lack of customer service with the staff. I will never be using this airport again and even after a drink from the limited choice in the cafe/bar I was still reeling. I can safely say this is the 1st and last time I will use this airport.,,0
blackpool-airport,Paul Wharmby,United Kingdom,We travelled to Turkey on Jet2 mid-August returning early-September. We travelled from Blackpool as the holiday was some £250 cheaper than using Manchester. The car park ticket machine had run out of tickets but that didn't matter as the barriers to P2 had been broken off. We parked a good 5 minutes' walk from the terminal but it's free so I don't really see that being a problem. The terminal building is very basic and is more reminiscent of a coach station but check-in and security were both quick and easy (as was paying the ADF) and we were sitting in the bar area enjoying our first drink of the holiday while we'd still have been in the security queue at Manchester. An important point was that because we were going on a small plane to a small airport check-in at Dalaman on our return was incredibly easy drawing jealous stares from fellow travellers who were in 200-long queues. On our return to Blackpool from wheels stop through security and baggage reclaim to leaving the airport took less than 30 minutes. You absolutely cannot get better. The airport has a runway planes somewhere to sit and somewhere to get a drink. What else do you need?,8,1
blackpool-airport,Alan Shaw,United Kingdom,Whilst the amenities are those of a small airport they are still extremely limited. My main concerns regarding this airport are the poor services offered by the lounge and payment charged is way in excess of services on offer. There are limited drinks no WIFI limited snacks and maximum stay without flight delays is approximately one hour. Also when flight arrivals are able to collect their luggage and able to visit the conveniences there is only one female toilet one male toilet and one disabled toilet all with insufficient toilet rolls. Totally unsatisfactory when approximately 300 people are landing.,5,0
blackpool-airport,Peter Walker,United Kingdom,The poor lighting inside makes it look as if you have just walked into a fairground dark ride. The gents toilet (singular you'll notice) always smells of something unpleasant. The advertising blurb tells of facilities that are never open and it has a help desk that is manned only when the staff feel like it which is as good as never. It looks like an uncompleted job on which the builders have walked off because the service pipes are all exposed and there is not so much as a false ceiling to hide it all. It has been like this for decades. To then ask the public to pay £10 each to refurbish something that should be done out of the operating profits over many years is a disgrace. Forget expecting to see a terminal akin to those airy ones with glass and steel as at `proper` airports this is a chicken-shed inspired windowless dark oblong box. You are unable to see any aircraft from inside or outside so plane spotters stay away.,2,0
blackpool-airport,J Hilton,United Kingdom,I flew to Palma Mallorca on 1st May and returned on 15th May. All in all the experience was very pleasant. There was far less hassle than at the larger airports and the facilities available were quite adequate for my needs. There were no queues at the check-in desk and no queues at the carousel on our return. All the staff I encountered were polite and friendly. I do not like flying at all but the relative calm and lack of large numbers of people made the experience far less daunting than usual. Blackpool airport is on my doorstep so I will definitely be using it again if I went to go to any of the destinations offered.,9,1
blackpool-airport,B Coward,United Kingdom,We flew on a Jet2.Com flight out of Blackpool to Majorca. At the same time there was another Jet2.com flight to another European destination. Check in with the Jet2.com staff was easy and a good experience. However we then had to join the chaotic scenes of security. One man checking the boarding passes of 2 charter flights (leaving within 15 minutes of each other) then onto security. Whilst I do not mind any level of additional scanning and checks the method that these were conducted was shoddy. There was one x-ray machine in use and many staff just stood around. We were asked to remove all electrical items from the hand luggage to go into separate plastic boxes. As we were doing this (on the floor as there were no tables to place our items on) the staff were tutting. Once we go through the person scanner the staff were telling us to move on into departure despite our items still being in a queue to go through the x-ray machine. I know this chaos is not a one off as when we returned from our holiday the place was late into Majorca and the cabin crew said that this was because of problems at Blackpool with getting staff through. The Jet2.com flights are weekly from Blackpool and clearly the airport cannot cope. We for one will not be flying from Blackpool again choosing Liverpool or Manchester (who have the same level of security but it is managed in a capable and professional way - unlike Blackpool).,,0
blackpool-airport,C Rigby,United Kingdom,I totally agree with the comments made on the 20.12.12 very stressful flying from here. We have had 4 holidays abroad this year with no problems decide to have a quick break to Dublin and this was the worse decision to fly from Blackpool. Will never fly from here.,,0
blackpool-airport,J Woodman,United Kingdom,Ludicrously complex system for collecting unannounced £10 airport departure fee with no information provided and staff unhelpful. Access from road well-signposted but then no indication of where to go (head as if for the hotel car-park). No facilities before Departure Lounge other than machines. Only bright spot was the extremely pleasant and helpful staff at Europ car-hire.,,0
blackpool-airport,E Harrison,United Kingdom,I have used the Blackpool Airport many times. Yes the airport is basic but convenient. There are few shops but then I don't fly on a shop. There are no major queues as a general rule. The terminal door is near the check in the check in is near security and you walk straight into the departure lounge. Highly recommended for families and disabled.,9,1
blackpool-airport,B Martin,United Kingdom,We arrived at the airport in plenty of time yet it took over an hour to get through security 2 flights were trying to get through at the same time. UKBA were inefficient one passenger was taken to a separate room and everything just stopped! There were 2 scanners but only one in use with half a dozen staff stood around doing very little. Our flight was 8.35am and we had to leave home at 5.30am did not have time to buy any mags or newspapers as most of our flight had already boarded. The £10 surcharge for each passenger means it would be cheaper to pay for car parking we have been flying from Blackpool for over 5 years and the improvement fee does not seem to be spent anywhere that we could see so as far as I am concerned it was a con. Our flight home was delayed an hour from Alicante.,2,0
blackpool-airport,M Kinney,United Kingdom,We travelled back from Blackpool airport to Belfast 10th Sep 2012. We could not get through security before paying £10 each why are travellers not made aware of this charge before they travel? This information should have been disclosed to all airlines and travel agents so that they could inform would be travellers of this fee.,5,0
blackpool-airport,S Orr,United Kingdom,"On Friday 7th September I and two elderly relatives both in wheelchairs flew from Blackpool to Belfast International. The transport infrastructure at the airport is all but non-existent. No buses nearby or trains and taxis have to stop a good 30 meters at least away from the terminal buildings even if you have pre-booked assistance they will not bring wheelchairs out. The airport development fee is a joke despite being a requirement to leave I have no idea what they are spending the money on as the airport have no improvements. The terminal building which looks like a converted hanger or warehouse is very poorly laid out. The only queue of the security area goes across the building rather than deeper into it and can on a busy flight extend into the check in area. The security staff themselves are beneath contempt. Once we finally got through to the lounge there was no information only a single small screen with flight details and the best part when our flight was called ""could passengers who have booked special assistance make their way to the gate - um how?. At Belfast Int. Airport staff come and get you. On the flight I was travelling on there were at least six people in wheelchairs but Blackpool does not have a working ambilift - a scissor lift on wheels with a cabin on the back used to get wheelchairs up to the level of an aircraft. So airport staff had to carry people up the normal stairs. Instead of spending £10 per person to get out of the airport use the money to get to Manchester or Liverpool.",1,0
blackpool-airport,T Brown,Ireland,"Very basic airport only one cafe and shop in deps area. In fairness there is only a handful of flights a day so its probably all that's needed but queues and the inevitable knock on effect meant our food arrived as plane was boarding. Hand luggage was weighed although collectively they were well under the 7kg each allowance some were over some under so we had to open them and move clothes between them. To add insult to this the handle of one of them was above metal frame and we had to either leave it or pay a £24 check-in fee. We chose to leave it and distribute the contents between other cases. The girl on desk was very nice and patient and even told us to just move things from one case to other however the whole thing was bizarre because leaving Dublin there was no problem with luggage and going back the plane was only 1/3 full so a bag 2"" over limit was not really going to cause problems nor was any extra weight {which wasn't an issue anyway}. Also why could the ""£10 airport development departure charge"" not be just added to ticket price? Speaking of that the security man when we going through was not aware that u16's don't pay it and held us up waiting on supervisor to come. I will go back to Blackpool but will probably go via Manchester even allowing for train fare it will probably work out cheaper and in my opinion less stressful.",3,0
blackpool-airport,T McAleer,United Kingdom,The airport is convenient in that it was only 20mins from where I was staying and I could get a lift from relatives therefore cutting down the cost. However on my return leg of my trip there was the matter of the 'airport development fee' which we were never informed of at any stage until we were turned away from the departure gate to go purchase this ticket! When I eventually got the ticket purchased they tried to tell me I was going to have to check in my bag because I was also carrying a handbag! I refused as I was able to carry both my handbag and hand luggage bag on outbound journey without any problems. Thankfully my sister was also travelling so I put her bag into mine! The airport is small but what do you expect for Blackpool? No need for a car plenty of trains about and good service!,4,1
blackpool-airport,P Hodgins,United Kingdom,For a start there are next to know facilities other than a shop that sells all the 'tat' of the day a small coffee shop with no food available and the toilets air-side consisting of an outdoor port-a-loo. We travelled though on 12th of April. After we had checked in we were informed that none of the security scanners were working resulting in all bags being hand searched. This was one thing but after standing in the security queue for over 2 hours only 2 flights were departing at this time we found that 4 of the 9 security staff were standing in a huddle having a chat while the airport manager was leaning on the wall. You also have to pay £10 'airport development' fee for the privilege of going through security! Avoid at all cost and pay the small extra to fly from Manchester.,,0
blackpool-airport,Roger Ward,United Kingdom,I have read numerous reviews complaining of the car parking and the development fee. Yes the car parks are not smooth tarmac but both are fenced with access control and CCTV so in reality they are as secure as most airports. As for the terminal I can imagine it struggles when at capacity but for the majority of the time the slots are such that there is only one full size plane at a time and for this the facilities are fine. There is not the glitz of most modern airports but for us this is a plus point. From check-in though security and to departure gate is probably no more than 100 paces. There are not many shops but a basic duty free shop a cafe bar and Newsagent.,8,1
blackpool-airport,Graham Leigh,United Kingdom,Left to fly to Alicante. Checked in on line to save time but spent approx 50 minutes in a corridor queuing to travel less than 50 yards for security checks - they only have one baggage scanner. There were plenty of security staff on hand but they didn't seem to be doing much and only had one speed - very slow. Elderly people and those with young children would have struggled. As we arrived in the departure area our flight was being called. Our return flight back to Blackpool was delayed leaving Alicante meaning it would have arrived at 12.30am Blackpool only stays open until midnight. The result was we landed at Manchester and had to be bussed back to Blackpool. The other problem at Blackpool is the £10 airport development Fee levied on every adult passenger. Goodness knows how much airport authorities have raked in from this scam but there is absolutely no evidence of any development taking place whatsoever. As for Blackpool International Airport an airfield would be a more apt description.,2,0
blackpool-airport,A Roberts,United Kingdom,A basic and small airport which although advantageous at times is also its downfall. On the third time of flying out of here recently myself and my family were booked on one of the two flights scheduled to depart at the same time this showed how inadequate this airport is at handling more than one flight. The sole cafe in the departure was overwhelmed to a point where the lack of staff meant they could only offer bacon/sausage/egg barms instead of the other breakfast offerings such as a Full English. It is unacceptable that the facilities are not geared to cope with more than one flight. The second criticism is the car park. Spaces are effectively unmarked and in bad condition the overflow car park to the side of the terminal building is a large lawn with some tarmac for cars to drive along. The £10 Airport Development Fee - I am struggling to see how this could be justified there is little evidence of this having been spent since its implementation and little/no evidence of development plans with this money. If they were using this money then I wouldn't have much of a problem but as this is not the case I do. Overall I was not impressed with my recent experience.,1,0
blackpool-airport,J Prentice,United Kingdom,Just used Blackpool airport must say what a complete shambles this place is - from so called car park to terminal which is very dirty and ill kept. As to £10 charge what do they use this for - it is not cleaning and refurbishment looking at state of place.,1,0
blackpool-airport,C O'Neill,,A small and quite basic airport. On arrival the baggage area felt quite temporary. It was small and a semi-permanent warehouse type of building. It was a kind of heavy duty plastic panel building. It was OK in summer but might be pretty cold waiting for bags in winter. Departing was fine clear and well signposted. The shopping/eating facilities were not great nothing wrong with them but just limited. The entire departure section of the airport appears to be 1 hall. So all the gates are easy to find and don't take any time to get to.,4,0
blackpool-airport,B Scott,,My experience of Blackpool Airport was not a positive one and I will certainly not be flying from this airport again. The free parking one of the airport's selling points is a less positive feature when you realise you are parking in a field a long distance from the terminal building. It would frankly be an insult to charge anybody to park on what is essentially a glorified field. The Airport Development fee though much needed in terms of the airport requiring a lot of development is also a very irritating element of this airport experience. There is certainly no evidence of this money being spent on the previously mentioned car park or in fact the terminal building which reminded me of a scout hut in terms of build and facilities. My experience was not helped my officious staff many of who were clearly on a power trip indulging in their own self importance. The highlight of this was in the cafe in the departure lounge where the man serving decided I did not have time for the bacon sandwich I ordered (without even knowing which flight I was on or in fact what time I was departing). The facilities are extremely basic. On our return entering the scout hut via a fire exit added to the sense of amateurism that surrounds the whole experience of flying from this airport. Unless flights were a complete bargain I would certainly not choose to fly from Blackpool again.,1,0
blackpool-airport,R Fairweather,,Nice small airport but agree that Airport Development Fund is a bit much. Hopefully it will be used to improve car park and signage. Had to park in a field masquerading as car park 2 no shuttle transfer so you have to drag your cases through the mud. Rest of airport is very pleasant with a nice departure area and on our return a very prompt luggage retrieval.,4,0
blackpool-airport,N Brown,,It was only after I booked a flight from Blackpool airport that I discovered our family would each have to pay £10 passenger Airport Development Fee which I think is too high. I now wish we'd chosen Manchester airport which does not charge passengers extra just to reach the departure gate. Blackpool airport is OK as it is without the 'enhancements' which are not always worth the extra expense.,4,0
blackpool-airport,C Stephenson,,"A nice small airport with a friendly atmosphere. Unfortunately this impression is spoilt by the Airport Development Fee which is cheekily charged to all adult passengers (you have to buy a ticket for £10 before you can enter the Departures area). This does discourage me from using the airport. We were allowed to enter the executive lounge (with free drinks) but I'd rather have kept the £20 - it represented about 10% of the flight cost. I don't particularly want the airport to ""develop"" as it's a good small size at the moment and small airports tend to be much better than big ones (see how Liverpool Airport has deteriorated as it has ""developed""!).",3,0

blackpool-airport,Andrew Bennett,,I used this airport for the first time last week and am not so enthusiastic as previous contributors. I arrived in the dark on a wet and windy morning and had great difficulty in locating an empty parking space in the ill-lit long stay area and was then faced with a quite long walk on an uneven muddy and potholed path to the terminal building. Monitor screens gave no information about flights until about two minutes before boarding. On the return journey it took half an hour for baggage to be brought all of 200 yards from the plane to the carousel at a time when there was no other activity whatsoever on the tarmac. Durham Tees Vally which I use regularly and must be of a similar size and level of busy-ness seems a much better-organised and more efficient airport: or was I just unlucky this time?,,0
blackpool-airport,Julie Moore,,What an absolute joy this airport is. Short taxi ride away extremely fast checkin from very pleasant staff. The seating area is very comfy.

blantyre-airport,Wilbert Wolfs,,Arriving at Blantyre's Chileka airport is a colonial experience. Arriving from Johannesburg the airplane is taxied in front of the arrival hall. School classes have already been run out to see the big bird landing. The building has a wooden veranda and there is a special area were people are expected to cheer after the president has landed. The first time I arrived at Chileka the luggage was simply dropped on the tarmac. The passengers had to fight to get their possessions. Of course quite some passengers did not find any luggage at all as it had stayed behind in Jo'burg. Immigration is quite impressive with a lot of stamps in passports and on listings. To get out you have to go through a door then you turn sharply turn left and right. Again left until you bump into the departing passengers and their luggage. Since half a year we have a new arrival hall at our airport.,4,0
blantyre-airport,Duncan Lee,,I flew from Blantyre airport a number of years ago and was struck by just how quaint the whole set up was. It is a very basic airport not far off the common 'tin shack' analogy that comes with most African airports. There is very little to do and there is just a bar to distract you. The best thing about Blantyre airport is the Duty Free shop. A selection so limited it is almost refreshing: Malawi Gin Whisky (JW) Cane spirit macadamia nuts coffee and nick nacks. I bought to 60W light bulbs that had been turned into paraffin lamps. Wonderful.,,0
bloemfontein-airport,Abraham Faure,,The improvements I mentioned in 2007 were completed on schedule and have given this airport a new and modern feel. Unfortunately the upper level is no longer a viewing deck area. However a new restaurant with a view of the airfield was installed on the ground floor. Facilities are top class considering the size of the airport. A brand new baggage retrieval area was added to the airport. The layout of the airport works well. Staff are still just as friendly.,4,0
bloemfontein-airport,Abraham Faure,,Bloemfontein airport is currently undergoing improvements to its buildings and facilities. This is with a view to the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup to be held in South Africa. I love this little airport because there is an air of excitement and a bustle of activity. While the upstairs cafeteria is undergoing improvements there is a downstairs cafeteria where refreshments may be purchased. The airport personnel are some of the friendliest i have ever met! Their are ample parking and car rental facilities available.,4,0
bloemfontein-airport,Gareth Bronkhorst,,A very small airport with a few facilities including a shop and a upstairs restaurant. They have several car hire firms to choose from if you are intending to rent a car. What was quite strange was that the arrivals and departure hall is in the same part of the airport. Check in was very speedy and over in less than a minute. The good thing is that you will not be subject to very long queues and passing through security is quite fast. If you happen to be at the airport alone take some reading material as there is not much activity and you might get bored fast.,,0
bloomington-airport,S Hedden,United States,Very pleasant and easy airport. Rental car lot a few steps from the exit door. Spacious airport has 9 gates but only about half are in use. Only complaint is restaurant is before security and closes their grill well before the last flights depart in the evening.,4,0
boa-vista-airport,Daryn Johnson,Cape Verde,"I personally really like this airport. It's small but does everything it needs to. It looks more like a sand castle than an airport but every time I've used it it's been easy to check in. Unfortunately there is no smoking area anywhere in the airport and considering a fair portion is non smoking I find that a bit strange. Also, once I was delayed and as there are no tannoy announcements you are left wondering about that status of your flight which if you've travelled TACV can be understood. However, if you're a resident of Cape Verde you do get used to the ""no stress"" mentality even if it can be frustrating sometimes. There's a bar either side of check in/customs and they serve snacks. There's also a small duty free shop but most airline's stock would be more comprehensive.",5,1
bocas-del-toro-airport,Andre Franca,Brazil,BDT-PAC. The airport is located on the Colon island you can actually walk into town but still taxis will charge you only 2 usd that's nothing really! There's only one building very small one x-ray and two counters one for each airline there are no carousels you'll have to wait them to offload your bags so you can pick them up on arrivals hall on departure the airline staff will open your bags to search for dangerous goods etc. The airport was under refurbishment but I believe it will soon need a better upgrade!,5,1
bodrum-airport,J Slattery,Ireland,"BOD has a 2nd terminal for low cost carriers called BILLI. This is now the busiest section of the airport but about one tenth the Size of the main terminal. It is a newly constructed windowless shed, the worst space I have ever been in. The management is chaotic with about a 1000 people congregated in a small overheated shed. On arrival the overbearing smell of sewage was Stifling. On Departure due to lack of organisation 100's of people packed into a tiny space all fighting to get to through passport control. Shame on all concerned including the low cost carries such as Ryanair and Easyjet who operate to this airport.",1,0
bodrum-airport,R James,United Kingdom,The new terminal is much bigger and better than the old one. There are 8 gates now and a massive departure area where you can easily find a place to sit and wait for your flight. Check in is quite fast. Ground crew is friendly and doing their job well. The only thing is that some ground crew members are better to improve their English a little bit. PA announcements is a rare thing in the new terminal and it is very hard to understand them. But I think the management is still working on improvement and soon BJV airport becomes one of the best airports in Turkey. Keep working!,8,1
bodrum-airport,C Longhurst,United Kingdom,"We have flown into Bodrum airport many times arriving and departing from the old smaller terminal which was always very busy with no where sit if many flights were departing or if you were delayed. We have just visited Turkey again and flew into Bodrum and used the brand new terminal. What a difference! It is more than double the size of the older building built over three levels with all the ""mod cons"" including airbridges so gone are the days with having to use aircraft stairs and buses to reach the terminal building and the aircraft on your return. It is very clean and well laid out with plenty of seats. Yes it is still very expensive to buy drinks and food but what airport is not! The duty free shop is massive. A job well done and it was a pleasure to use! Roll on next time!",9,1
bodrum-airport,D Preston,United Kingdom,Food and drink prices are outrageous. If one flight is delayed (peak season) there is no seating space at all once you are airside the lucky ones get a wall to lean against whilst sitting on the floor. Easyjet is a shambles when your flight is announced consequently families are split up on board the plane. Speedy boarding offers some solution but many people sneak through or come up with ridiculous excuses. Toilets need to be more up to date in arrivals and departure lounge.,1,0
bodrum-airport,Una Smythe,United Kingdom,It was like a football crowd trying to get in one small door. You go straight through security before entering the airport then check-in and through security again. My problem was check-in the desk for Gatwick was taking 10 mins plus to process each couple/family. Some sort of proper queue is needed. No seats people laid all over the floor this is for very late flights so people are tired.,1,0
bodrum-airport,Robert Ellis,United Kingdom,Nice little airport if only one flight is in we arrived in departures 3 hrs before take off to find our Thomson flight had only one check-in open. This led to a queue which snaked around the airport interfering with other customers. Eventually 2 other desks were opened but no staff manned them for 20 mins this caused numerous fall outs among customers.,1,0
bodrum-airport,G Maxwell,United Kingdom,Been to Bodrum a couple of times in recent years. First time around we were gobsmacked at the prices - once bitten twice shy. I believe travel companies reps and even the airlines could do more to warn unsuspecting tourists about the high prices.,2,0
bodrum-airport,Sarah Banks,United Kingdom,Having just returned from our third trip to Turkey and third time using Bodrum airport we weren't too surprised by the prices (although our first time in the airport left us totally gobsmacked by the prices charged for food and drink). Unfortunately we were not aware that you could no longer take liquids through to departures with you and had to dispose of our water at the security desk. What did shock us was the fact that the staff at the desks where checking the bottles if opened they where disposing of them if the bottles where sealed and appeared full they where putting them into large plastic crates obviously for there own consumption. Duty free prices where same as UK more expensive than many high street stores and toilet facilities passable considering the number of passengers using them. As stated in other reviews if the cafes lowered there prices on food and drink they would actually sell more. Its quite sad that your holiday ends on such a low note.,3,0
bodrum-airport,O Dubben,Germany,Bodrum is the most horrible airport I have ever been to. When we departed the airport was very crowded and no seating available (don't even think of airport lounges). The prices in the cafe are the highest I ever encountered at an airport - 5 Euros for a soft drink and 7 Euros for a snack. Toilets were ok if you consider the vast number of people present. I would avoid this airport if there was a real alternative.,1,0
bodrum-airport,Tony Fabian,United Kingdom,Went through Bodrum yesterday and all previous comments borne out. It is the only airport I know where duty free prices airside are double the tax paid ones. Can of coke on the check in side TL5 once through to airside TL10. Also ladies loo was described by my daughter as one of the worst she's ever been in. A national disgrace in an otherwise charming country.,1,0
bodrum-airport,J Hall,United Kingdom,I have been using Milas/Borum ever since it opened as an International Airport circa 1998 two or three times a year and as with most airports would expect it to improve with time. No such luck everything appears to be aimed at totally ripping off the customers. Cafe Sera prices are an insult to all travellers. Maybe its time for another franchisee to be given the opportunity to supply a better and more reasonably priced service.,2,0
bodrum-airport,Paul Cox,United Kingdom,Just got back today they're still robbing with impunity. £14 for two beers and £5 for one litre of water. Of course they know you can't take liquids through now. Onur Air aren't much better either.,1,0
bodrum-airport,J Rowles,,Just flew out from Bodrum Airport. The prices in the cafe are an absolute disgrace. Drinks at Bodrum airport were three times the price of those on the plane. 3 Euro for a small water no other drinking water available. Turkey is a fantastic country it is such a shame to leave on a negative feeling. The Airport is ok but it has to be given a one star just because of the cafe a real shame.,1,0
bodrum-airport,E Watson,,Bodrum Airport prices an absolute disgrace. Yes still 5E for a can of coke which was handed straight back. They had taken my water off me at security so though thirsty was more determined not to give in to their daylight robbery.,1,0
bodrum-airport,Nick Paul,,Through Bodrum in September 09 (using the international terminal for first flight departure of day for domestic service to Istanbul. Check your airlines departure point - may not be from the separate domestic terminal which is a taxi ride away from the international hall). Good and clean facility security to enter the airport checks bags and persons through detector gate. Toilets clean and well signed. Gates clearly marked for departures. An outdoor cafe offers croissants pastries sandwiches coffee and teas - with a table service - but as with all the other comments - watch the prices - 2 coffees 2 crossants costs 22YTL - and from the cafe inside at departure 24 YTL for 2 glasses of fresh orange juice. Upstairs a further cafe offers meals but closed at time of day at he airport and can't presume the prices were better. One small shop with a few sweets and gifts - but no stamps sold here so don't plan to post any last minute mail. Limited seating in departure hall - 10 seats in total - (plus others for the cafe) before going through passport control. Prompt and efficient check-in procedures handling a fairly full flight. Good signs for departures and quick passport checks. Ample seating at gates. No air bridge to planes though so expect to get wet in poor weather. Apart from food prices - a good and efficient place. Just turn up and travel if you can rather than hang around and wait.,3,0
bodrum-airport,M Bishop,,Difficult to add anything new to the comments listed. Both the prices charged for food and the state of the loos should be considered a national disgrace.,1,0
bodrum-airport,J Catherall,,As reported by previous passengers the prices in this airport are very high and very poor value for money payable in euros turkish lira or pound sterling. Dull duty free shopping where is there any exciting duty free? I think that disabled passengers could not access the first floor cafe so are restricted to the ground floor area with unappealing furniture and probably the same high prices. The public areas were clean male toilets ok. Buses to planes.,3,0
bodrum-airport,E Wright,,Can only echo all the comments of the ridiculous costs of tea / coffee / refreshments. I would strongly suggest not buying from the cafe in the upstairs departure lounge which is probably the biggest rip-off in 30 years of air travel. To make things worse we were delayed 3 hrs returning to Gatwick - eventually leaving at 0600 from our check in at 0100 - and I still wouldn't buy a tea for £4.,1,0
bodrum-airport,Gareth Bowen,,A little crowded and long waits when many flights leave about the same time - but that is to be expected. The biggest problem is the cost of refreshments in the Cafe Sera. There is no justification for an instant coffee - not much bigger than two espressos - costing 5euro (£4) or a small plate of fries at the same price - captive client base with one airline (Onur Air) operating a no meals on board service! The airport rating goes down significantly because of this.,3,0
bodrum-airport,M Price,,Facilities are basic. Toilets disgusting. Staff work hard and are efficient in moving people as quickly as possible. Security not as high as UK airports but there are more smiles and a good deal of patience. As stated in every entry above the prices at the rather shabby cafe are stupidly high. Best advice is ask the cost before you buy then don't buy. I doubt the owner of this concession ever reads these reviews or would even care if they did but I will never buy another item from this place.,2,0
bodrum-airport,Stewart Townsend,,Just returned from a holiday in Turkey via Bodrum Airport. Whilst the public facilities at this airport are adequate and clean the catering is a total rip-off. Soft drinks retail at £4 a can (70p at Bristol Airport) and a very basic meal comprising hamburger chips and soft drink will set you back £10 a head! Best to take your own sandwiches and drinks. The Duty Free isn't particularly good value either. Don't forget that you have to pay £10 a head for a 30 day visa on entry to Turkey. So have cash to hand.,2,0
bodrum-airport,Tony McLaughlin,,I was quite impressed arriving at BOD in the new Hall A. It made a change to arrive at an airport which is an airport and not a shopping mall. If you are leaving from BOD Hall A you would be advised to eat and drink before going airside as facilities there are very limited. Also if two international flights are leaving at roughly the same time there can be a long queue to get through passport control and even if you have a Club Class ticket you cannot jump the queue. The Salon des Vignobles is not worth the additional money (if you are not in Club Class etc) as the selection of refreshments and snacks is very poor.,,0
bodrum-airport,J Lock,,The airport has plenty of seating which is just as well because many of the charter companies using it appear to have poor timekeeping. However the food and drink on sale is a total rip off - €5 for a can of coke you must be joking! I travel a great deal worldwide and this airport must be about the most expensive. Do they not understand that if they lowered the prices they might sell a lot more? On the plus side they do not seem to stop you taking your own food and drink through which is what I noticed all the regulars doing.,1,0
bodrum-airport,Simon Boxall,,One piece of advice: buy bottles of water and snacks in supermarkets before you leave - the airport prices are ridiculous. Over £5 for a small cup of coke and £4.30 for a bottle of water! Don't even get me started on the price of burgers and fries! If you're flight is delayed - good luck!,1,0
bodrum-airport,T Mahmood,,This airport is very basic. Add to that the absolute rip-off prices it seems the Turks want to wring every single pound out of you before you leave. Prices are not cheap in the tourist resorts but I was shocked at snacks and beverages being over eight times more expensive in the airport than outside. That's blatant profiteering and the one small stain on a wonderful Turkish holiday. The fun starts the minute you step out of the airport and not before!,1,0
bodrum-airport,Wendy Chapman,,"Everything previously said is true - no help at security check in or passport control. In fact it appeared that you could take any food and drink through into the departure lounge. The duty free staff appear to try and sell anything to anyone including vodka to my 10 year old daughter and it was hardly duty free prices. The cafe is a rip off three portions of ""chips"" a ham sandwich and four drinks was 83 lire (everything is priced in euros but they will work out the price in any currency) and I have now seen the dirtiest place in Turkey - the toilets in the airport. Although staff did put on some entertainment by driving a remote control car around the departure lounge!!",1,0
bogota-airport,F Vernier,France,All new nice but wifi not working properly in national hall terminal 1 and no quasi no charging place. Fast security check.,8,1
bogota-airport,Frank Sherwin,Chile,I pass through this airport on a regular basis both national and international terminals most recently at the end of April and beginning of May 2015. In general the airport facilities are good check-in procedures are generally quick as is the security process. Before passing security there are several restaurants at the end of the terminal building on level 3 after the national check-in area. A Juan Valdez cafe is being constructed in front of the international check-in area. There is a reasonable selection of shops in the international duty free area but a very limited selection of restaurants. WiFi in the whole airport is free but very poor the cafes and restaurants don't have their own WiFi zones. There are no options to buy pre-paid SIM cards for the major operators at the airport. A major problem currently is the airport taxi service on exiting the customs area in arrivals you will be immediately and aggressively pursued by taxi operators. Normal (yellow) city taxis queue outside (there are separate queues for national and international arrivals) but overcharging is now rife taxi drivers try to charge a COP 40000 fee for transfer whereas a metered taxi would correctly charge at most COP 28000.,7,1
bogota-airport,Abdulla Alkhatib,United Arab Emirates,The Airport is modern and clean. It is the best in South America and is better than many airports in the USA. The immigration staff are fast and friendly and luggage delivery time is excellent. My only criticism of the Airport is that it is too grey and it does not have enough greenery (indoor plants etc.) in a country that is so green and colourful.,10,1
bogota-airport,Andres Cortes,Germany,I was very surprised by the quality of this airport. It's nice and has everything you need. The staff are very courteous and at every corner there is someone to help you. The staff starting from the airlines agents customs duty free and shops are excellent. The airport was absolutely clean and totally new renovation that makes for me one of the tops in the world. I live close by Düsseldorf and I'm proud of this small airport.,10,1
bogota-airport,P Sale,Colombia,This review refers to the Domestic Terminal I had to fly from Medellin to Bogota and return the same day. El Dorado International Airport may well have improved their International facilities but it appears at the expense of their Domestic clients. For the Country's main airport this is a disgrace The Airport Staff were not helpful also surly and you could hardly blame the there is very limited seating for waiting passengers until you had´ passed security to the gate (This also applies to International Passengers) I had a a six hour wait for my return flight and was expected to stand the whole time it was that or sit on the floor. I suffer with my back so asked which Gate I would be leaving from and was told that it was not assigned until an hour before the flight therefore I could not even go through and sit airside. In comparison to MDE Medellin Bogota is light-years behind If you ever have to wait for a flight I would suggest taking a taxi to a nearby Shopping Mall and pass the time there before heading to the Airport Passenger satisfaction is the last thing on their minds!,1,0
bogota-airport,J Velasquez,France,Very good airport. Probably the best in the region. It is spacious clean and quieter than others I've been through in South America. The staff was polite and efficient. Check-in and customs were quite fast. The bad thing is that there are no decent restaurants after the passport control.,8,1
bogota-airport,Harold Bush-Howard,United Kingdom,Domestic flight with Copa to San Andres. The airport is new but the facilities are almost non-existent. The international section of the terminal has restaurants and nice shops but the domestic side has only one shop a Dunkin Donuts with overpriced although very good coffees and muffins. What a shame. The queue was very large.,3,0
bogota-airport,A Parejo,France,Excellent facilities probably the best airport in the region by far. Still needs to finish the ongoing work but it now a world ranking airport.,9,1
bogota-airport,Sebastien Aponte,France,Nice experience good facilities. The new Eldorado is a real international airport you have everything you need when you have some connecting time. Big and pleasant business lounges a bit crowded at peak hours but still very comfortable.,10,1
bogota-airport,Harold Bush-Howard,United Kingdom,I arrived 29 May and immigration was empty so was quick to get through. Bags were out very fast. Problem was on leaving the customs area I was stopped by a policeman (he was in a group of three) who body searched me and forced me to show him how many dollars I had. He was incredibly rude when I protested (I speak Spanish). I complied with what I was asked but found this experiences most unpleasant. I have travelled extensively in the last 25 years and have been to over 70 countries but have never encountered a situation whereby a policeman actually searched me and insisted on my showing him my wallet and its contents. No idea what his intentions were but I did not feel comfortable with a body search on entering a country and being forced to empty the content of my wallet.,8,1
bogota-airport,Diego Ortiz,Colombia,This is a new airport too big in comparison with other airports in South America very clean and very friendly people working here. The most modern and beautiful airport of Latin America.,10,1
bogota-airport,John Manson,United Kingdom,I went on a business trip last week and they finally ended the construction of the new national terminal I took a connection between Bogota and Medellin it was really easy. My connection lasted 2 hours and I found some particular stores to buy some interesting souvenirs. Free Wifi is great.,9,1
bogota-airport,O Gomez,Colombia,"Since the new international terminal was opened this airport has improved a lot the new building is modern and airy also there is a lot of check in modules lots of stores about food options there are two restaurants before immigration and a food court in the waiting area. There is free wifi in all the airport and works pretty well. The new national terminal will be open in October or November 2013 and the full demolition of the old terminal and the new control tower will be ready by June 2014 but even with all this work the airport is already working well be aware that there its a little terminal call ""puente aereo "" that its managed by Avianca.",9,1
bogota-airport,Harold Bush-Howard,United Kingdom,Great airport. Now up to Asian and European standard. Immigration both and arrival and departure was quick (less than 5 minutes) and so was customs check on arrival (every single bag is put through x-ray). Only problem I saw was chaotic and very busy taxi rank at around 7-8 pm when several flights arrive from the US and locals tend to bring a lot of stuff. Very good that one does not have to go through a second security check immediately before boarding for US and some European flights. The terminal is modern well lit and airy. Good selection of shops although stuff still mode expensive than in the city. I cannot see why they call it duty free. It is more like duty hike.,9,1
bogota-airport,David Stein,United States,My experience at Bogota's new airport was very pleasant. It is clean and modern with many stores in the departure area. Check in and passport control are both efficient and quick.,8,1
bogota-airport,G Benussaf,Colombia,Bogota airport has become very good recently. There are still (minor) glitches - mostly the taxi line is sometimes disorganized. But arriving to Bogotá going through customs and waiting for luggage are all fast and well organized. Checking-in may be slow or fast depending on the airline. But once checked-in there are various options for food and shopping. Of course only one third of what will be the new airport has been completed so far. Eager to see it finished. If the rest of the airport is going to have the same quality I will be very glad!,9,1
bogota-airport,Cesar Figueroa,United States,I have been traveling back and forth from BOG for the last 7 years and recently landed in the new international terminal after being away for 1.5 years. Although I agree the new international terminal has some minuses mainly in its long-term capacity and some details here and there in terms of decoration and painting the airport has improved greatly! It is much much more user friendly the lighting is great and is full with big windows and golden tiles. It has great shops and restaurants and the duty free is world-class at this point nothing to compare to the few shops present at the old terminal. Also and at least as of March the immigration process took less than 5 minutes all together not only for me but for everyone else who landed on my flight. The baggage claim area is large and bright and the system for baggage delivery is similar to big world airports such as JFK or LHR so nothing to be envious about. I believe with time BOG will become a great connections centre for Latin America and I strongly recommend it for future travels.,10,1
bogota-airport,J Gutierrez,Canada,"The airport was clean even though construction was in progress. The staff at immigration were disrespectful chatting with friends eating behind the counter while people were waiting to be helped and playing on their cell phones. There were 5 ladies behind the counter and 4 of them left at once leaving one girl to fend the desk and the line up of people there. She continually left us to help other people and made us wait 1hr before she completed the papers we needed to catch our flight. We were boarded on our plane and ready to go only to be delayed 5 hours sitting on the plane while engine maintenance was performed. Everyone seemed to be running on ""Colombian time"" chatting away and not working. I was only too excited to get away from there.",,0
bogota-airport,Richard Jenkins,United States,Recently completed an international round trip through El Dorado and another through its primarily domestic sibling (Terminal 1). The departures and at least part of the arrivals area for El Dorado appear to be in their new facility. The immigration formalities when quickly perhaps because it was a light arrival without a lot of other concurrent flights. Even in the Green Lane there is an obviously very perfunctory X-ray of luggage which mostly seemed to be a time consuming annoyance. The 'authorized' taxi queue is supposed to provide an estimated fare but does not do so. International departures area is bright and without the din of TV monitors found in the domestic airport. Only two cafe type restaurants in the ticketing concourse (almost hidden at the far end away from the ticketing area) along with a more visible snack bar. The actual departure area beyond security has many shops and a phantom food court which I was unable to find although there was a bar and cafe in the main concourse for gates. Two big inconveniences: Departing flyers need to visit a stall to see if they have to pay departure tax (it may be included in the ticket price) - there is nothing to draw attention to this stall and I found out about the requirement only after queuing up for departure. Fortunately the airline (United) let me go and comeback without re-queuing. Foreigners are supposed to be able to receive a VAT rebate if purchases exceed a certain threshold however there is only one place to do this in the domestic terminal. Security in the new terminal is erratic. Domestic terminal oddly has many more food options in the pre-check-in area than the bigger international terminal but nothing in the gate areas. Queuing for check-in is long and inefficient. The security protocol is very simple and there is no need to remove shoes watches etc. The 'gate' for my flight was in a bullpen in an airless poorly non air-conditioned part of the airport on the second floor with only vending machines for refreshments. Announcements translated into English only for international flights and even locals had trouble following the ones in Spanish. Monitors not updated and I determined that my flight was boarding based on Avianca's website. I had to trek to the other side of the airport to board no one was in any great hurry so I assumed this was a typical protocol. On return the baggage claim immediately spills into the taxi area. A nice new airport with limited facilities and ineptitude with tax issues along with an older domestic terminal that's great until you have to check-in.,3,0
bogota-airport,J Velasquez,France,Great airport. The new building has a spacious bright and transparent architecture. Good selection of shops and facilities. Waiting rooms are comfortable and quiet. The immigration process has improved a lot as they've increased the number of counters. It was a very pleasant experience. The only bad point was the customs process which was a bit too long. They don't seem to be prepared to deal with an increasing number of tourists.,10,1
bogota-airport,Sam Hussein,United Kingdom,Landed and departed recently from the new International terminal at Bogota. Sadly Colombia missed a real opportunity here. To show the world what an upcoming destination it is. The design is boring and full of grey paint. It could be anywhere in the world. Nothing to show the vibrant colours and life that is Colombia.,5,1
bogota-airport,A Gumucio,Mexico,Two words: avoid it by all means. Take any other option until the new terminal building is operational. Until then you will only find chaos specially if you are taking a national connecting flight. When you arrive from an international destination you will face very long lines in customs even if your luggage has been transferred to the final destination. Then you will have to wait for a bus which will only leave for the national terminal when it is completely packed. It will make one or two stops before you get to the national terminal after riding through planes cranes and trucks. Once at the national terminal there is no place to sit every meter is crowded then you walk and walk until you get to the plane to the stairs actually because they don't have direct access through boarding bridges. Nobody understands why such a large capital city has not taken provisions much earlier and is only now doing what should have been done 20 years ago.,2,0
bogota-airport,M Reid,Canada,We had to take our luggage on an overcrowded bus from the domestic to international terminal. No one was controlling the number of people on the bus and people just kept getting on until the doors would not close. There was a complicated set of security and immigration checks and we were just tourists leaving the country. Pieces of paper picked up and stamped passport stamped multiple times for no apparent reason. We were jammed into a departure lounge with no washrooms or facilities of any kind. Long queues for everything and top dollar prices for everything.,3,0
bogota-airport,Dimitris van Leusden,Netherlands,We visited in September 2011. I had read various comments about the queues and so on and was prepared for the worst. To our surprise the immigration queue went so fast that we didn't stand still at all (plane arrived 19.30). In fact there were more that 20 counters with immigration employees making the process amazingly fast. The immigration officer we met was very friendly. As for baggage collection I have no opinion since we had only carry-on baggage. The customs queue was a little bit slower but not slow enough. And the customs officer didn't lose time making useless questions. All in all within 5-10 minutes (literally) we has landed and were out of the airport. As for cleanliness everything looked good. The ceiling seemed a little bit old but that's all. It seems that the airport was recently painted and/or renewed.,5,0
bogota-airport,G Fairburn,Australia,You know you have arrived in South America upon arrival at Bogota. Flew AA from Miami. The first thing is the aged appearance of the airport with low ceilings and a dank feel. Chaotic arrivals area that can make it hard to find who you are looking for. Departures area is extremely busy at time of AA morning flight to Miami. Remember to go to the tax office line prior to the airline queue - this process seems archaic. The same staff who check you in will perform the final security check and will then be your flight attendants so the Bogota shift is certainly labour intensive! Duty free is cheap but staffed by extremely surly employees. Purchase if you dare. Certainly very dated and can only look forward to when the adjacent new terminal construction is completed.,1,0
bogota-airport,C Choi,Norway,You get processed fairly quickly but that's about the only thing positive I can say about our experience there. An embarrassingly small selection of low-quality overpriced (by Colombian standards) food and duty free stores staffed by the MOST arrogant rude lazy and generally useless people we have met in Colombia which was quite a shock after all the simply wonderful and friendly people we have met throughout our travels there. Left a rather sour taste in our mouths really. Can't recommend anything other than just checking in waiting and getting out of there ASAP. Overall the worst airport we've ever had the misfortune of using.,1,0
bogota-airport,Uwe Bode,Colombia,Bogota wants to attract more international traffic without improving the bottlenecks that are causing a lot of congestion. As of 31st of October LH is going to be back in BOG with departure and arrival times precisely at the peak hours late evening and arrival around 8pm- ish. More chaos programmed! Premium passengers will be shocked to see no fast track lane waiting for at least 30 minutes at immigration. As I live in BOG I do not have to change from El Dorado to Puente Aereo but I always can see upon arrival that it is a horror for those who have to. The saving grace are the fast track immigration lines for families with children and the good shops once passing emigration process. As far as Avianca check-in for premium passengers is concerned there are long lines too especially when leaving at the before mentioned peak hours. Same refers to the Avianca lounge it is unbearable between 7:30pm and 9:30pm only around mid-day it is worth spending time there. But it is true F&B offer is ridiculous the few snacks available have to be put on napkins as there are not even plates!,3,0
bogota-airport,Richard Winger,,BOG is turning into a total disaster under the twin pressures of increasing passenger loads and a long overdue incredibly slow renovation. Inbound immigration is often understaffed and the wait can be upwards of an hour. Domestic connections on the main local airline Avianca require another long wait for a long ride to their domestic terminal. Because the buses don't run frequently enough they are always packed and uncomfortable. Outbound if you are a premium passenger check in at Avianca is efficient. If you are just a normal person count an hour to get to the check in desk. Security and outbound immigration have improved and are now mostly quick. Avianca's international lounge renovated only two years ago is already run down with minimum food and beverage offerings but blaring TV sets all over the place. The second security check on US bound flights is a free for all. Surprisingly Avianca the main carrier at the airport has except for check in no fast track for premium passengers so regardless of how much you pay for your ticket or what elite status you have you stand in line with everybody else. Very democratic certainly but not very effective if the carrier wants to position Bogota as a hub for business travel into South America.,1,0
bogota-airport,B Rowan,,Landing at this airport is chaotic and getting a taxi can be trying. I flew Jet Blue and we existed on the tarmac and then walked outside then into the airport for immigration baggage and customs. After existing you need to go upstairs in order to find an ATM as there are none on the level where you exit. There is only one money exchange place which is a rip off. Departing: The lines at this airport are extensive. I flew Jet Blue to Orlando and would recommend getting there at least 3 hours early. You have to pay your departure tax at one line get in line for jet blue where they ask you about your trip and check the size of your carry-on baggage then you get in line to get your boarding pass and check your bags then you get in line for security then you get in line for immigration then you get in line at the departure gate where they hand search every single passenger's luggage and you get a pat down then you are allowed to board. There are few food options but a few places to buy souvenirs. It's nothing fancy but the lines are ridiculous. I understand that the airport is undergoing massive construction which is necessary everything is very outdated.,2,0
bogota-airport,J Faubert,,Since Delta's flight from ATL was early we hoped everything was going to be pretty well throughout. Very first line was long but it was fair fast staff provided us information about customs-forms and connecting flights (not good signs at all). Immigration was Ok baggage was awkward and a little messy as there were about eight flights claiming and rebooking luggage for connections. Finally a Customs-check where there's a huge line for passing through a redlight/greenlight device. It seemed every people who get redlight must stay for a final baggage-checkpoint. Departing was far messier than arrival. Prepare to pass through 4 security checkpoints. staff seemed to do it as best as they could; is a very small airport for handling all those pax specially in the morning.,4,0
bogota-airport,M Kattan,,The airport is clean and tidy. It takes a long time to get through if you are travelling international flights. The Bag searches are done all the way upto the plane which can feel a bit over the top but for all the right reasons! Allow 3 hours at least! Staff are nice and polite. You can get out of paying for the tax if you smile and ask nicely! check in staff can wave the fee if they want too!,4,0
bogota-airport,C Ford,,Allow 2.5 to 3 hours for international travel. Departing pax are selected for extensive baggage search I was one of them polite but thorough. If connecting with a domestic flight the domestic airport is about a 10 minute ride from the main airport use either a taxi or free bus service supplied by Avianca. Only buy immediate currency needs at the airport better rates are in town using ATM's. First time travelers using taxi service should go to the little office at the exit from customs to the right of the exit and get a suggested taxi rate to your destination in the city on a ticket supplied by this office. No wonder US Customs never bothers you on your return as I believe this is the most cautious airport that I have ever traveled thru. All airport personnel were polite. They are proactive not like us reactive.,4,0
bogota-airport,Harold Bush,,I travelled to Bogotá from Miami (AA) and Madrid (IB). The airport has improved enormously and is being extended. Immigration is still slow on arrival but it is better. Nice that the officers now smile and welcome visitors to the country. On departure allow an extra 30 minutes if travelling in the early mornings or mid-afternoons. To avoid queuing on the day of travel to get exemption from paying the extra tax get the stamp on arrival at the desk located next to the toilet in the baggage hall (sadly very rarely there is someone there; very strange; even at 2-7 pm when most flights arrive from Europe and the Americas). You cannot take baggage trolleys outside the terminal but there are plenty of porters to help. Apparently this is a way to help them. No problem with that except that they are always in a hurry and will leave you for another customer if your baggage do not arrive quickly.,3,0
bogota-airport,Simon Smith,,I used this airport flying Iberia to/from Madrid. The arrival service was fast efficient and pleasant - no queues baggage delivered quickly and the immigration officer even welcomed me to Colombia! Departure was another matter. At about 3pm when most of the flights to Europe are checking in the departure hall was so full it was almost impossible to move. When I checked in with Iberia they explained that I had already paid the airport tax on my ticket but I'd have to get an exemption stamp from the airport tax office. This meant another queue for at least 30 minutes; but if I was willing to pay the tax for a second time I could have done so immediately. This just seemed to be a way of extracting extra cash from people willing to pay not to stand in another long queue! Once I had finally checked in things improved and there was little queue at immigration or security. However shopping and catering options are limited and be warned that once through security there are hardly any shops or cafes.,2,0
bogota-airport,Tony Villegas,,Eldorado international terminal too crowded in the morning and afternoon hours and the check-in area is too small to handle passenger numbers. Parking in front of the terminal: more than 100 meters away is a tragedy when you travel with lots of bags. You find security everywhere what is good but which reflects the dangerous situation of this beautiful country. In the second floor you get some good snack bars and coffee shops. Immigration officers unfriendly terrible and lots of hand baggage and personal security checks. Hard to breath at the gate area - too low ceiling. Its 1970s facilities need urgent updates.,2,0
bogota-airport,Jacqueline Struss,,The airport is clean security everywhere but my experience leaving the country to get back the USA was terrible. I went through 4 baggage searches within yards of each other. While sitting waiting to board a worker comes up to me and no one else and demands to take my carry on baggage away because he claimed it would not fit in the overhead. I argued with him and did not let him take my baggage (everyone staring at this time). He finally backed off and left. Went to no one else questioned no one else attempted to take no one else's bag. He was an employee. I believe he was trying to take and steal my bag. In talking to others it may have been he was trying to do that. I loved the country but the airport experience was not pleasant!,3,0
bogota-airport,Luis F Mejia,,Eldorado Airport is conveniently located and immigration-customs procedures are as quick as they can be. Cabs are just steps away and you get a ticket stating the amount to pay to whatever final destination within the city you are going to. Cab drivers info is clearly visible when stepping in and you just sit and enjoy the ride through this magnificent city !,,0
bogota-airport,Marc Schwartz,,"Recently visited Bogota (via Miami on AA). This airport compares favorably to others I've been to in central and South America. The airport is conveniently located. Processing at all steps was efficient and friendly. I felt safe and secure. (AA does have a secondary security screening at the gate.) The airport does have an ""old"" feel but it is not run-down. I would warn that on the return to Miami I did feel that the flight got 'special attention' at immigration and customs. Miami (via Bogota) is where to expect the extra delays etc.",,0
bogota-airport,R Weber,,Funny that all bad comments have been posted by Colombians. Nothing new as Colombians tend to be ashamed of the place where they have been born as soon as they live in a foreign country. Bogotá Airport is certainly not comparable to airports in Europe like Munich Frankfurt or Heathrow but certainly much better than CDG or Barajas. It's clean people are extremely friendly and the security measures are stronger than in some European airport.,,0
bogota-airport,Jean-Louis Vergaert,,El Dorado Airport shows its age and there can be some long walking due to lack of walkways but it is relatively efficient. Before passing through passport controls you can enjoy good food and natural fruit juices at very reasonable prices. Security is usually fast and I always enjoy being questioned the friendly military (always mention your Colombian girl-friend!). Taxi's are cheap and very well organized providing good security in a country with such a bad reputation! But the great warning sign is the confusion between the terminals - you are better to be sure of which one you must go to because there is no indication and many exceptions to the common rule of the Avianca Puerto Aereo.,,0
bogota-airport,Bernardo Löwenstein,,Bogotá´s airport is having a revival. It's a nice airport to use friendly staff tight security controls. The buildings are very clean there are plenty of shops and fast food restaurants are cheap and very good (try Oma or El Corral). The transfer service offered by Avianca (Alianza Summa) to the domestic terminal (Puente Aéreo) is efficient and quick. Duty free is a bit expensive restrooms should be cleaner but in all it is very much above Latin American average and more user friendly that many other US airport.,,0
bogota-airport,K.Jütten,,I have been used the Bogota airport around 8 times during the last two years and I thinks this is one of the best in America. It's clean clear safe and people is very friendly and courteous. The duty free shops are very good and fast food restaurants are cheap and well served. Taxi counter is organized and service is safe and cheap.,,0
bogota-airport,Mario Almeida,,A surprisingly good airport. Good shops and souvenirs a very efficient taxi stand and friendly and helpful Colombians.,,0
bogota-airport,M Bregenz,,I arrived in Bogota from Munich. I was impressed with El Dorado Airport. I have only positive good things to say about it. People are courteous friendly and helpful. The airport is very clean good fast food restaurants and excellent duty free shops. Security is very good and I felt safe there. Overall compared to New York's Kennedy or Paris Airport I have to say El Dorado Airport is less confusing and more efficient.,,0
bogota-airport,Harold Bush,,I fly into Bogotá-ElDorado about three times a year from London. Immigration control and customs officers are friendly to foreigners; they are rude to Colombians. They are from Colombia's secret police DAS and one has the impression that they assume all Colombians passing through the airport are drug dealers or criminals. If you are Colombian with a second passport use it on entering or leaving the country because it will be much easier. Be prepared to be searched more than three times before boarding. This is good. Security is extreme and queues tend to be very long. Check-in can be a real nightmare. It tend to be very slow. Duty free is very expensive. In fact some goods are cheaper in downtown Bogotá. Trolleys in arrivals hall cannot be taken outside; a really stupid thing. Why put them there in the first place? It is a good airport by international standard with plenty of fast food restaurants and nice shops to purchase great coffee (but before duty free).,,0
boise-airport,M McManus,United Kingdom,The airport is a small regional airport. However there is a nice souvenir shop and a decent number of places to eat given its modest size. One thing you will see in the airport is life size cardboard cut outs of the famous Boise State American Football team the town's most famous export. There is a bus link from the airport to downtown but when I went it appeared to be having serious delays. A cab into downtown is not too expensive. The queuing times are very quick as this airport never really gets too busy as it is small.,7,1
boise-airport,R Dunford,,Pleasant enough airport small yet not crowded enough for it to be oppressive. Free internet for your laptop throughout the terminal is good (take note Seattle Dulles and O'Hare).

bologna-marconi-airport,Alessandro Mosichetti,Italy,Luggage claim is very long: you can wait up to 40 minutes to get your luggage.

bologna-marconi-airport,J Howell,United Kingdom,We were due to catch a flight at 10.25am on Sat 29 June 2013. The queue to check in the Easyjet flight was lengthy but nothing to compare to the queue for passport control. There was no proper queue so passengers were joining the line from all directions. There were only 2 customs officers checking passports which they scrutinised in considerable detail. At 10am we were nowhere near the front of the queue and there was no representative from Easy Jet to assist. We were all stressed that we would miss our flight. Eventually an indistinct announcement told Easyjet passengers to move to the front of the queue which we all tried to do. This was not popular with other passengers. We boarded the flight 5 minutes late. A horrible experience.,,0
bologna-marconi-airport,J Reddy,Luxembourg,Totally misleading information on the departure screens. Arrived by taxi at the airport from Bologna Train Station (15 euros for 4 people) only to read that Ryanair's flights have to be checked in in the East terminal. That is 10 minutes walk away at a fast pace or wait for a small yellow novelty train shuttle. Only to discover that passengers with just hand luggage need not check in here first and can go directly to the departure gates. The message on the departure lounge screens should say Only passengers with luggage to be checked in should go to the East terminal. Imagine this journey on a wet night with luggage a pram and a toddler in tow?,1,0
bologna-marconi-airport,S Curfs,Luxembourg,This airport is being upgraded but in the meantime is quite run down. Check-in area with large queues check- in staff not nice at all. Lounge has a dedicated security lane which is nice and the guy responsible for the bar in the lounge is very nice! Limited shopping possibilities. Boarding process as chaotic as can be bussed to the airplanes which is not very nice if there's no air-conditioning in 40 degrees sun. All-in-all not my favourite airport.,4,0
bologna-marconi-airport,Peter Cullen,United Kingdom,No major complaints this is an efficient and convenient airport. Queues for immigration check-in and security all less than 2 minutes and luggage retrieval about 5 minutes.

One slight gripe the coffee was not hot - but this seems to be the way it is in Bologna.,9,1
bologna-marconi-airport,A Caltabiano,Italy,Bologna Marconi My experience has always been below average of previous comments. Long queues at check in.

Price of the Aerobus to/from city centre is high related to the distance; frequency anyway very good.,2,0
bologna-marconi-airport,Paul Harvey,,From landing to being on the airport bus to town (5 euro) took only 10 mins.

An easy airport and a pleasure to use.,4,0
bologna-marconi-airport,S Bott,,A very good airport in all respects and very easy to reach from the A14 autostrada. The airport is small and not overcrowded and layout means that it is easy to navigate. Security and passport checks are efficient : when departing the Schengen and non-Schengen gates are separated - to access the non-Schengen gates one has to pass through a passport control booth which is quick to get through. Baggage reclaim is extremely quick: I spent only 10 minutes between getting off the flight and exiting the airport.,5,0
bologna-marconi-airport,F Dellera,,Arrived from FRA baggage delivery was quick and efficient I strongly appreciated the police kiosk inside the airport taking care of troublemakers or drunk passengers that sometimes bother other people.

bologna-marconi-airport,A Sahakyan,,Arrived from London Gatwick (LGW) with BA direct flight. There was no air bridge and passengers had to take a shuttle bus to the terminal. Because of arriving from a non-Schengen country I had to pass through passport control. The Italian border official was surprisingly quick and efficient and 15 min later all the passengers were already in the luggage area. I had to wait for almost 45 mins to collect my luggage and in fact it was the only flight at that moment with 50-60 passengers only! The airport is small and tidy. Upon arrival one can see a queue of authorized taxis waiting for passengers. A short ride from the airport to Bologna would cost EUR 15-20.,3,0
bologna-marconi-airport,Barry Byrne,,"In many respects a small pleasant airport. Unusually now it has rather more amenities groundside than it has airside. A large bookshop with a small selection of foreign language books food shops and catering facilities. Catering facilities airside are very limited if you want something substantial have it before you pass security. Check in was slow for no obvious reason but pleasant but many carriers have check in machines here so many passengers might avoid this problem. Security queues despite the limited flights were particularly slow but seemed to speed up later as perhaps more scanners opened up. Not a place to push your luck on clearing security in a hurry however. Beyond security there are few amenities shops geared to high end ladies interests newsagent and what was a very expensive ""duty free"". Wine here was as expensive as it was on the hotel menu the night before and at least one perfume was 50% dearer than in the airport at home. Although the aircraft parked 10m from the gate we were still bussed all the way. That was after a long time penned up and standing in the bus one easy way to reduce carbon emissions - let us walk! There was a spontanious outburst of derisory cheers when we eventually arrived at the plane. Bologna has an excellent and frequent public bus serving downtown including the railway station.",3,0

bordeaux-airport,Nuala Nic Ghearailt,Ireland,"I travelled through Bordeaux airport last week (inbound and outbound) and it is the poorest quality terminal that I have experienced as a flight customer. As highlighted by a number of the earlier reviews there are many problems/inconveniences: As I approached the security area - I was asked to push my carry-on luggage along chip-board tables (while sometimes taking my luggage off to avoid the roof poles). The security area was so busy (and it appeared the staff were stressed) that a 200ml bottle of sunscreen that I had forgetten to take out of my handbag was not picked up by the security screeners. We could not proceed to go through the passport control (unusually enough this appears to be a requirement upon leaving the airport) as there are only 2 boarding gates (beyond passport control) and they were full with passengers waiting for their flights. Once we could proceed to our gate (called 35/45) it was clear that the facilities at the gate were extremely basic. It has very few seats (I'd say about 10-15 for a full flights of about 200 passengers), no air conditioning (or at least that is how it felt), no toilets (and in our senario our flight was delayed by an hour) and no snack / beverage areas (particularly if one needs water). The procedure to use the toilets requires one to give one's boarding card to the airline staff at the gate, take one's passport to go out through passport control and to use the toilets in the 'main' lobby of the terminal.  In some parts of the terminal, particulary in the arrivals area, there is a very strong smell of fish. A very pleasant security guard sought to explain what the cause of the smell is. I didn't quite understand his French - however, it is clear that the fish smell is a problem and the authorities are aware of it. The same security guard stated that the design of the terminal resulted in a very poor experience for both passengers and staff alike. I commend all the staff we encountered as they were very courteous and professional while working in a stressful environment. I think the Billi Terminal in Bordeaux Airport gives a very poor impression of the airport as a whole and it is should be a priority to upgrade it.",1,0
bordeaux-airport,Mark Daly,Ireland,"I arrived into the main terminal with time to spare to see on the information board that the check in desk status was Billi. I had no idea what that meant nor was there any explanation so I waited for 15 mins or so for an update as I assumed it was just too early to check in. I eventually asked a member of staff what Billi meant and was told I had to leave the building to go to another terminal outside. On arriving here I found an enormous queue/crush out of the narrow doors onto the street and had no choice but to join. It was an hour before I and my 2 small children got to the desk to check in where I discovered I had to take my bags and put them onto a conveor belt myself (via another 10 min queue) to go to the plane. Then i joined a 15-20 minute queue to get through security followed by a rush to passport control. On arriving at passport control we were pushed to the side as there was no more room in the departure area due to delayed earlier flights so we waited 20 minutes. Eventually we were ushered through passport control and arrived into a hall area with seating for 10 people tops! At this stage my son asked to go to the toilet and I was told no toilets existed in this area and I would have to leave and come back in through passport control. Also our flight was delayed by 1 hour but as there were no screens or information boards we had no idea of this so spent well over 1 hour in this area. No toilets, no info, no wifi. My advice - stay away from Bordeaux unless travelling mainstream airlines!",1,0
bordeaux-airport,Gary Willis,United Kingdom,"Departure from the Billi Terminal at Bordeaux Airport is without a doubt the worst airport experience I have had in the developed world. Aesthetically it resembles a pre-fabricated shed, that aside: the check-in process is pathetically poorly designed, with passengers having to take back their baggage for the hold once they have checked in and carry it round themselves to the x-ray machine. Then once through security there are too few seats for everyone waiting for their flights, so yesterday I would say 20% of passengers had to sit on the floor or perch on ledges. Then when we got through to our gate there were maybe 10 seats, reserved for EasyJet ""special"" customers, and no seats whatsoever for the rest/majority of passengers, so another bout of standing up or ledge perching. If I had known I would have paid extra to use another airline using one of the proper professionally built and operated terminals, or indeed a different airport altogether. ",1,0
bordeaux-airport,Morgan Dye,United Kingdom,"I think there are two sides to Bordeaux airport: the main terminal and a budget airline terminal. The latter was really bad when I travelled through a few weeks ago. I think they must be in the process of upgrading it, or building it altogether! Presently its like a DIY airport made out of Ikea flatpack. When you check in you have to take your bags round to a separate desk for them to be tagged and sent to the plane. This created a pretty chaotic and busy environment. The queue for security was long and merged with the queues for the bag drop area. Once through security there were more queues that snake round the shopping section whilst people wait to go through immigration and the boarding areas for the flights. This means that its impossible to look round the retail area and food areas. It was all so chaotic and such a muddle! I'd hate to think what it'll be like once peak season kicks in. As i said, i think they're in the process of constructing this terminal, which is called the 'billi' terminal, as it had a very temporary feel to it. In the meantime, prepare yourself for lots and lots of chaotic queuing. Review is based on billi terminal only - rest of the airport may be a dream!",2,0

bordeaux-airport,Jeff Michel,Switzerland,If you think Luton is bad (and it is) the Billi Terminal at Bordeaux is awful. People living in the Bordeaux area must be appalled at this joke of a terminal.

Absolutely filthy and dysfunctional avoid Bordeaux (Billi Terminal) like the plague.,,0
bordeaux-airport,Ken Barber,France,Well a lot of people agree Bordeaux Billi Terminal is dreadful and there are many derogatory words used to describe it. I agree with most of what has been said. The question is who was involved in its planning and design i.e. who should take the blame? Is it purely the Bordeaux airport authority or did any of the low cost airlines become involved in it's concept and thus became implicated in any criticism? Does anyone have an answer? For me I will avoid Bordeaux airport completely and fly from the far superior Toulouse airport or from Bergerac. I would vote that Billi should be demolished like many others.,,0
bordeaux-airport,P Aylett,United Kingdom,Astonishing that nothing has been done in five years to improve the joke that is the Billi terminal at Bordeaux. The most humiliating thing is the scramble for plastic trays before security and the bizarre shuffle along Formica topped tables. Humping bags from check in to baggage chute is strange too. The building has been designed on similar lines to a battery poultry unit but the construction is less sophisticated. There is a reasonable amount of choice in the nearby regions including the pleasant airport at Limoges. Billi deserves to have no customers at all.,,0

bordeaux-airport,R Angermeyer,Germany,Billi the airport part for low cost flights (Ryanair Easyjet) is of unacceptable simplicity.

bordeaux-airport,Mike Saunders,United Kingdom,Avoid this place-it looks like an abattoir from the outside. Inside the cattle theme continues as you are herded around like farm animals particularly at the gate where you have to wait in a sort of holding pen rather than being allowed to sit down. The queues were awful. The bag drop was awful. There was not enough space in the departure lounge. Sandwiches cost 6 Euros a coke 7 Euros. Worst of all were photographs of groups of people around the place wearing T shirts spelling out BILLI - as if they had something to be proud of! They couldn't even bring themselves to give it a proper name like 'terminal 2'. The only good thing I can say about it was that it made the easyjet flight seem luxurious. I will do my best to avoid this airport in the future - particularly if I have kids with me.,,0

My experience started when I entered the airport by hire car and could not find the signs for the drop-off point. Nothing of the sort. I had to leave the airport via 'autres directions' and loop round a perimeter road and eventually using guesswork find the Europcar drop-off point. The other disappointment was my wife and I having to lug bags ourselves from the check-in point to another point for them to be X-ray scanned. That was a first for me having travelled around the globe for many years. Very primitive for a 21st-century airport in modern France! Another annoyance was when a tin of 'foie gras' was confiscated by security staff as it did not have a label. Then I went to the refreshment kiosk to buy a soft drink. A can of Coke was priced at 2.40 Euros about 4 times the price in your average supermarket! Profiteering at its ultimate an absolute disgrace! Many companies are offering their services at this airport so why don't they do something about it? Needless to say I will not be using Bordeaux Airport ever again and would urge others not to go anywhere near it.,,0
bordeaux-airport,David Hodge,France,Bordeaux is our nearest airport and Gatwick is our usual return destination. So we have a choice of British Airways or Easyjet. The BA flights times are not great Easyjet's are better. Depending what offers are on the prices are often comparable. Unfortunately I took an Easyjet flight and had the extreme displeasure of using the Billi terminal. A cattle-shed basically - although under EU directives I don't think you are actually allowed to treat cattle as they do in the Billi terminal. The length of the queue to check-in was dire. Then queue number 2 is joined to deposit luggage (for which I paid you to handle for me Easyjet) at the scanner while some idle layabout sits and watches. Indeed he only got animated when a surfer dude put his board through and it gets to the right angle turn at the end of the belt. Anything over a standard suitcase is going to get stuck. (There is an oversize luggage belt back in Hall A). Then I can only echo the waiting with 6 seats available. Easyjet what have you done? I presume this cattle shed is to reduce costs that is Bordeaux Airport charges them less to handle the planes luggage etc. It is a bad mistake. It is dreadful. I am afraid you have now driven me to British Airways. I expect to check-in my bag and see it again in London. What next? I have to go out and load it on the plane too? Bordeaux is a nice little regional airport perfectly equipped.,,0
bordeaux-airport,K Jones,Spain,There is only one word for the Billi Terminal and that is disgraceful. My main complaint is that there are no toilets in the terminal with passengers having to walk (or run) to the main terminal to use the facilities there. Before boarding the plane passengers are forced into a small room with hardly any ventilation no seats or toilets. Elderly people have to stand for ages and some people end up sitting on the floor. The same story on the way back no toilets until you have managed to pass through security control and then collected your luggage and gone to the main terminal. I plead with the airport authorities to do something about this and to treat it's passengers with respect and consideration (think about those who are elderly with young children or disabilities or health problems) no matter what airline they are flying on.,,0
bordeaux-airport,S Williams,United States,I have to agree with most others here - I had a horrible experience here at the Billi terminal. It was stressful tiring and the Ryanair staff were rude and impatient. I was told to stand in a line that no one was operating and as a pregnant person with back pain from standing it was awful. I will never travel in/out of Bordeaux again and I warn others to avoid it for their sanity.,1,0
bordeaux-airport,J Porterfield,United Kingdom,At Billi for Ryanair flight and experience once through security can only be described as like a cattle market! Is tiny and difficult to move around as queues for the gates go through the shopping area. Announcements are poor and can hardly hear due to the noise of passengers in this restricted area. Not enough toilets. We had a very uncomfortable and stressful experience.,5,0
bordeaux-airport,Roger Troughton,United Kingdom,"As others have said it's a shed. A big wooden shed. My wife agreed it's the worst airport terminal she's ever been to and she's been to Africa! How could they possibly think that a ""gate"" without seating is acceptable in 2013? How can they think that a bag drop where you queue to have the bag weighed then queue again to put it onto a conveyor belt is providing an acceptable service to travellers in Europe in 2013? Paradoxically the rest of the experience was fine prompt disembarkation when we arrived speedy passage through passport control both ways and reasonably speedy security. It was just that bloody shed with its badly signed directions and lack of seating! They need to get a grip and provide facilities in keeping with the wonderful city they are serving.",1,0
bordeaux-airport,Eric Leveel,South Africa,"Billi terminal quite a joke whereas the main terminal is quite pleasant. Had to wait there longer than planned due to a delayed flight to Barcelona. Hardly any seating arrangements beyond paying at cafe. No room to manoeuvre between queues cafe customers and shop clients. Boarding ""gates"" are laughable and boarding areas nothing more than cattle pens. I simply do not know why Bordeaux Airport is not making use of the main terminal to full capacity! I have flown on Air France from the main terminal and it is indeed a different world. At least security was pleasant and efficient as well as the baggage drop facility manned by friendly security staff. I will not even comment on the air ventilation air or the ""outside"" cafe made up of a van selling overpriced coffees and pastries. Quite sad for a wonderful city like Bordeaux with plenty tourists and business people visiting.",1,0
bordeaux-airport,A Johnson,United Kingdom,Billi Terminal is truly awful. Not even any toilets before security control. Virtually no seats at the gate. Rude and disinterested unhelpful staff. The terminal is just a poorly built shed.,,0
bordeaux-airport,T Liddell,United Kingdom,Ditto to all the other complaints about 'Billi'. The one cafe was massively overcrowded no seating anywhere else. It is a basic warehouse with nil facilities for comfort or safety. The main airport I noticed with all its facilities was almost deserted. Empty of people! Indicating an absolutely idiotic policy of herding their main passenger base through humiliating cattle-like experiences. They are shooting themselves in the foot here. People do not like paying to be insulted. I was especially angry and annoyed to see elderly and disabled with no seating or toilets available even for them.,,0
bordeaux-airport,M Lea,France,Bordeaux Billi - not the main terminal which is perfectly acceptable. The worst experience both for departure (crammed into departure sheds with little/no seating ) and arrival requires that passengers climb +- 20 metal stairs up then down (presumably over the departure gate) carrying a 10 to 20 kilo bag and or pushchair only to find that there are no WC facilities apart from in the main terminal. Who designed this shed and with what kind of service in mind? They tell us that their terminal keeps the price of our tickets low. I do not believe this excuse. It is my belief that they want the experience to be so awful that you will go back to paying Air France over priced fares on short haul flights! This is the worst airport experience I have ever had.,,0
bordeaux-airport,M Dukes,United Kingdom,In relation to Billi: the very worst terminal I've been to. There are 5 areas to this terminal. Baggage arrival Arrivals hall Departures hall Departures and Departure gates (past Frontier police). There are only toilets in Departures. That means you have to walk to the main terminal on arrival or before going into Departures. Once you have passed the frontier police there are no toilets until the plane. If there are two jets leaving close to the same time then the departures area is absolutely swamped. The queues go through the middle of the restaurant and down through the (duty) free store. However the main parts of the airport i.e. Terminals A and B are absolutely wonderful. This new terminal is an ugly stain on the whole show. They should really be listed as separate airports so that to good part does not suffer from the negative reviews of Terminal Billi.,,0
bordeaux-airport,N Gwynne,United Kingdom,Flew in and out of the new Billi terminal with Ryanair this September with our children. I would agree with all the other posters that this is the worst terminal I have ever passed through (and I have been through a lot in far flung places). Its not obvious that budget airlines go from this terminal. We had to ask after wandering around the main terminal trying to translate what Billi means in French. With three flights checking in people were queuing out of the door and luckily it was not raining and with only 20 seats plenty of old people and kids were having to stand. No toilets. Then a long wait to get through security and then after that a departure lounge with enough seats for about third of the passengers waiting. The final insult was queuing for boarding where again there was 3 seats and not even enough space for everyone to fit in. Funnily enough by the time our kids got on the plane they were pretty grumpy and so was I. Worst terminal par excellence.,1,0
bordeaux-airport,F Delpech,France,I've been flying in and out of Bordeaux airport for 12 years (and I've lived here for 5 years now) and it was always a pleasant experience until the opening of the new Billi terminal. There are no toilets where you check-in and no toilets after having gone through immigration (where you usually have to wait 40mins - 1 hr before being put on the plane). Very little seating once you're through security you have to weigh your bags and then take them to be put through the scanning machine. The shops are ridiculously expensive. The main issue is what happens once you're through customs there are usually 4 seats (for a plane load of people) and no toilets or any other amenities for some reason you're checked through customs about 1 hr before departure so you have to wait a long time standing up (why can't we go through customs when we're actually ready to board the plane? Lastly arrivals is also a joke no toilets when you're waiting for your luggage to arrive. There are also no toilets for those in arrivals waiting for family/friends. Billi terminal will deter people from flying to Bordeaux the only reason I use it is because I don't have a choice as I live here.,1,0
bordeaux-airport,P Somervail,United Kingdom,The Billi terminal will deter us from flying to Bordeaux again: we cannot understand why the city of Bordeaux considers it acceptable for its visitors to arrive and depart from such a dire terminal (see other comments below none of which have been addressed). 0/10. The terminal also reflects badly on the airlines who use it: we flew with EasyJet who usually treat their customers far better than this.,1,0
bordeaux-airport,Tim Charlton,United Kingdom,The Billi terminal is a disgrace it treats no-frills passengers like cattle. Lifting your luggage on and off the scales and then taking it to a conveyor belt. It's appalling from start to finish we only have low cost flights locally so why penalise us.,1,0
bordeaux-airport,Michèle Jarrige,France,In general a smooth-running and convenient airport easy city bus access every ten munutes (line 1). One minor drawback - there is not enough parking you can spend 20 minutes driving around the car-park looking for a space. But you can easily park free of charge in a side street in nearby Merignac and catch the bus every ten minutes. And one huge drawback - the dreadful new low-cost (in every respect!) terminal rejoicing in the irritating name of Billi. Total absence of comfort in arrivals there are no toilets available to those meeting pax no airport information desk and no machine to pay car-parking you have to go back to the other terminals - outside in the rain! Obviously the national airline put pressure on the airport to stop low-cost passengers enjoying the same facilities as other airlines.,3,0
bordeaux-airport,I Oddy,France,Having lived in France for the last 20 years I have seen the growth of Bordeaux Airport. However the last trip to UK found me searching for Billi only when I got to Hall B was there any indication of where Billi was. Having stood in the queue to register and then carry my luggage to be loaded I found there was no where to put the luggage trolley no seats to sit and in entering the waiting area little services at extortionate rates no toilet facilities and only when one passed through immigration were any available. While waiting at the departure gate we were herded like cattle no toilet facilities no seating for the elderly and infirm and a total lack of courtesy from the staff in attendance. On arrival at Bordeaux once again there were no luggage trolleys they were found outside.,1,0
bordeaux-airport,F Mulrooney,United Kingdom,Waiting to board a flight at the Billi terminal is something I do not wish to experience ever again. We were dropped off at the departures terminal and took a few minutes to work out where exactly our flight was departing from - unclear signage. On finding Billi we waited in a queue for over 30 minutes when we had already checked in on-line to discover than the girls on the desk were writing luggage tags and boarding cards by hand (in 2010!). We then had our luggage weighed and then had to collect them to queue again to put the bags through a security check (2nd passport check of the day). Then came the third queue to have our passport checked again to go through hand luggage security which we then queued for again. After clearing security there was very little space to repack hand luggage put on belts & shoes watches etc. We then went through to the departure lounge (read shed) where we paid 9euro for water and a sandwich and queued to use the only toilet. (There are no toilets whilst waiting to check-in/ bag drop or whilst waiting to board the plane). The seating are for eating/ waiting is smaller than the duty free shop and has one information board facing at the duty free shop with the back of a TV the only view to those waiting to board flights. Then came the worst part - boarding. We queued again to have our passports checked and then ticked off on a list by hand (where are the electronic systems) only to be crammed into a space with no windows what seemed like no air conditioning no toilets 4 seats people on crutches standing people with children sitting on the floor and a general feeling of being herded like cattle into a confined space. The place should be pulled down!,1,0
bordeaux-airport,D Chown,France,"Regarding the rather irritating name for the new low-cost terminal it is ""Billi"" because it is short for ""Bordeaux Illico"" or ""Bordeaux pronto"" recognising the rapid turnaround. Apart from that it is a hideous black and white striped squat block. Total lack of comfort and facilities. The addition of this terminal means the free period in the drop-off car park has been reduced from 30 to 10 minutes. If this is what the chamber of commerce think is going to attract more low-cost airlines maybe a re-think is needed.",4,0
bordeaux-airport,John Tidball,United Kingdom,The new billi terminal is a disgrace and shows the utter contempt that the Bordeaux airport authority have for so-called low-cost customers. Elderly people having to sit on window ledges or the floor at the departure gate is inexcusable and those responsible for this so-called facility should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves.,1,0
bordeaux-airport,Peter Cullen,United Kingdom,The new low-cost terminal is awful. Not quite as bad as the inhuman misery of Marseilles- Provence but not far off it. Laughably it is called Billi - are we supposed to feel better about being treated like cattle if the shed has a stupid name? As you enter leave your dignity at the door you are now a piece of self-loading freight. They have not wasted money on seats information screens (there appeared to be one) staff computers and other luxuries. Surprisingly they have found the money for a 'duty free' shop (most prices seemed higher than in the supermarket). You will stand in queues with your luggage to show your boarding pass passport and of course a good 20 minutes at the 'gate' (ie a door). What really puzzles me is why they have done this; I have used the main terminal at Bordeaux several times with low cost airlines and found it perfectly adequate and not overstretched - why is 'Billi' necessary? I can only assume it is about putting people in their place and if you are a low- cost passenger that place is beneath contempt. If the people who design these horrible places read this have you ever tried using one of your terminals under normal circumstances? Probably not you are too busy enjoying the business class lounge. If you are responsible for managing one ditto and put someone who knows what they are doing in charge; also invest in some new technology - checking people by hand went out about 20 years ago at most airports. If you are a passenger complain write reviews and fight against this they have nothing to do with efficiency and everything to do with increasing profits through sub-standard facilities.,1,0
bordeaux-airport,David Williams,France,Bordeaux (Marignac) airport now has a normal city bus link to downtown Bordeaux. Line 1 runs every ten minutes while the airport is open for a flat fare of EUR1.40. Not only does this make reaching the city much easier and cheaper but it means one can park in any side-street along the route and take the bus thus avoiding the crowded and expensive airport parking. The newly-completed third terminal (low cost airlines) is expected to enter service shortly.,4,0
bordeaux-airport,Gary Farrelly,,Classy architecture and nice decoration hides a badly laid out and thoroughly confusing airport. Once a passenger has passed into gate 14 there are no toilets and catering and to go back out is at the discretion of the guard at the door. Walking distances short and good views of apron from all public areas.,3,0
bordeaux-airport,E Dubern,,"Airy and efficient airport with plenty of automatic checking machines and nice design. A cheaper and more convenient option to reach Bordeaux that JetBus is to take city bus #49 (20 minutes frequency) in front of terminal A to tram stop ""Lycée de Mérignac"" (in 18 min) then take tramway line A to Bordeaux City Center (in 23 min). Traffic free peaceful and cheap (140€ in total).",4,0
bordeaux-airport,Mark Evans,,Not too pressured an airport in terms passengers volumes so therefore possible to appreciate the light and spacious layout. Highlight of the landside facilities is Les Navigateurs resturant which is value for money for an airport restaurant and offers good quality dining and service that one rarely encounters at other airports. Airside facilities much more basic. JetBus service to and from city runs on a 45-minute frequency single fare of EUR7. Shame the new tramway wasn't extended the few couple of from Merignac to serve BOD - the JetBus can get badly snarled in the Bordeaux rush- hour traffic.,4,0
bordeaux-airport,Keith Partington,,Not as happy as the previous correspondent with this airport I have to say. I didn't have a lot of time and as I had (thought I'd) checked in on line I went straight through security to the departure lounge for my easyJet flight to LTN. When I say straight through I mean eventually through as the online check-in and self-printed boarding card was not initially to the liking of the security staff. Once through I found one tiny bar that only sold beer or coffee and hardly any seating. Access to the gate area was barred until just before the flight arrived. I found a seat bought a pricey beer and used the free Wi-fi until I could get through to the gate. Make this place a hub easyJet and maybe the terminal facilities will expand with the passenger numbers? It has worked elsewhere.,3,0
bordeaux-airport,David Chown,,All work is now complete with much more space in both terminals additional shops tourist agencies restaurant facilities and check-ins. Car-park is maximum 5 minutes walk although spaces are sometimes hard to find. Very short walk to and from aircraft. Only problem is non-car access. The comment below about the trams is correct they will shortly reach Merignac Centre but this is miles from the Airport. The shuttle is not frequent enough 45 minutes wait.,,0
bordeaux-airport,Niels van den Berg,,Very convenient airport if you are in a hurry. Small clean you walk from the aircraft to the exit in less than 3 mins. Too bad KLM Air France are the only ones providing flights to AMS - so the ticket prices went up 300% since the merger. So now you must fly with a stop over to save some money.,,0
bordeaux-airport,Roger Brickwood,,Small well laid out but public transport to the city needs to be improved. The Merignac-Bordeaux bus runs infrequently and takes forever. Time for a rail connection!,,0
borg-el-arab-airport,M Abdou,United States,Clean and modern. Queues at immigration especially when you find no one helping however the immigration officer was polite and friendly. Airport is isolated outside Alexandria. The only way to go to Alexandria is Taxi who normally abuse that they are the only way to leave the airport and charge too much.,4,0
borg-el-arab-airport,A Mukhtar,Malaysia,Airport was new and very nice. Immigration friendly and welcoming. Nice first impression on Egypt upon arrival. Washroom need to be cleaned regularly though. Other than that it's a very nice airport for travellers to Alexandria.,4,0
boston-logan-airport,Dalana Huss,United States,"Not enough staff to handle lines in baggage claim and at security checkpoints, so extremely long lines and wait times. Flight delayed multiple times by more than 2 hours. All bathroom toilets blocked up (tried 4, all were stopped up). Water fountains not working. Hot at gate/terminal areas. Customer service not helpful. Horrible experience.",1,0
boston-logan-airport,Allison Stieber,United States,"Boston Logan has maintained its abysmal record of uncleanliness in the women's restroom opposite the Delta Airlines boarding area. On a recent trip, as on a previous one in the fall of 2014, this restroom had dirty toilet stalls and nonfunctional ""automated"" sink handles. The airport is, in general, user-unfriendly. Yesterday I had intended to wait for a friend on an arriving flight in the cell-phone lot, which I'd not been to before. The signage to the lot was so confusing that instead I ended up in the central parking garage. Signage from the garage to the US Air arrivals area in the terminal was similarly unedifying; I had to ask an employee for directions. Same thing to navigate the return to the garage. The signage for the terminals and parking is not only confusing but also dangerous: any attempt to change lanes runs the risk of involving oneself in a crash with one of the numerous fast-approaching vehicles on one's tail. I always dread having to pick up anyone at Logan and often resort to telling visitors they must take a cab.",3,0
boston-logan-airport,Brian O'Connell,United States,I've flown out of here a few times recently as it tends to be cheaper than my hometown airport (MHT) the Virgin America boarding area is small for the number of flights it handles and places to eat in Terminal B are kind of sparse. With all the international carriers coming in as well as being a focus city for JetBlue BOS does need to step its game up if it wants to compete on the world stage of airports but at least its wifi works for the most part!,7,1
boston-logan-airport,J Murday,United Kingdom,Really sorry I chose to transit through Logan. With waiting for buses queuing surly TSA and airport staff it has got to be one of the poorest airports. They conspired to gobble up over 2 1/4 hrs in a simple transfer from Terminal B to E. Why an advanced country such as America and a wealthy city puts up with such a shambles I can only guess and it seams to be getting worse. The management need to get out and see how a proper airport is run.,1,0
boston-logan-airport,Eduardo Pinzon,United States,I love this airport didn't have to make a line for security since I had the TSA Pre-check. Terminal A is very clean and has some good restaurants.,10,1
boston-logan-airport,JA Berg,United Kingdom,Huge delays even for US citizens. One line just to get to the computerized passport scanners then another line to talk to the immigration officers to collect the customs forms then yet another huge line for everybody where there is one person to collect the electronic printouts. This is going backwards not forwards in time and efficiency. And after a long international flights it is painful. The last line is for everybody and one person there to collect the forms. This is absolutely ridiculous.,,0
boston-logan-airport,J Page,United States,Taking a mid morning flight on Southwest arrived about 8am to get breakfast. Nothing open in entire airport but Dunkin Donuts. I am diabetic and nothing to choose from but donuts bagels etc. No tables at all so all the people on the long line had to balance their food and drinks on their laps or between their knees. Logan is an international airport so I am shocked that no restaurant is open at 9am.,4,0
boston-logan-airport,K Halouska,Spain,I was worried about using Boston Logan earlier this month but entering and leaving (from / to Frankfurt on Lufthansa) was hassle free and I was pleasantly surprised. There were not long lines compared to some US gateways – and the border control officers could not have been more considerate. Once through it is a short walk to get to the taxi stand.,9,1
boston-logan-airport,L Salem,United States,I fly out of Logan every week without any issues. The new United Terminal is lovely lots of good places to eat and the Berkshire Market is great for take away. The lines are short and as I am a FF I can take advantage of TSA pre check. The airport has under gone extensive renovations in the past few years.,8,1
boston-logan-airport,S Simpkins,United Kingdom,We arrived into Boston Logan from Canada so went through the immigration process at Montreal. This simply left us to collect our bags at Boston and leave! Luggage delivery was quite quick although the $4 charge for a cart is a rip-off which nobody was falling for. Quick and easy.,8,1
boston-logan-airport,R Tompkins,United Kingdom,Arriving on an international flight you expect to queue at immigration but not for over 2 hours and we were almost the first off the plane. Those at the back would have faced 3 hour plus wait and included families with v young children and babies. Just 4 out of the 20 or so immigration desks open! What's the point of 20 desks if you don't use them and zero facilities in the hall for people waiting. Its an international airport it cant be a surprise when international flights arrive. Still we didn't have to wait for our luggage when we finally got to reclaim. Immigration guy was friendly only positive about the whole thing.,2,0
boston-logan-airport,Derek Chilvers,United States,Most international arrivals seem to involve a minimum two hours delay sometimes three or four hours even for US citizens. All passengers arriving on a given flight are often made to wait in a corridor for an hour before being even being allowed to enter the passport hall. Then it takes at least another hour to get through passport control. The final insult is that even if you have only carry-on baggage there's another hour-long line just to leave the baggage claim area where just one guy collects each passenger's customs declaration form at a snail's pace.,,0
boston-logan-airport,R Gonzaga,Malaysia,Departed from Boston on Southwest to Baltimore. Check in area was empty but it looked inadequate for a peak time departures. Southwest use the E pier which seems to be isolated from other parts of the airport. Efficient TSA checks with friendly staff and good banter. The waiting area itself was somewhat dismal with little seating and few options for food: Dunkin Donuts and another bar. Otherwise other facilities were well maintained and clean.,7,1
boston-logan-airport,N March,United Kingdom,I travel through Logan every couple of months for business. I get very frustrated with the repeated extensive waiting time to get through security.

boston-logan-airport,H Frank,United States,"I am a 23 year-old girl. I use this airport 2 to 3 times per year. I absolutely hate having to use this airport. Every time I come here the TSA agents give me such a hard time. I wear knee braces due to health issues and I have to wear special orthotics in my shoes. Every time they have to metal detect them rub them each with a pad pat them down and they've even made me take them off and send them through the x-ray machine. This time they made me take my shoes off and stand on the cement with no support for 10 minutes. When I tried to explain that I was in a lot of pain and needed to sit if they were going to take my braces and shoes but before I could even explain anything the TSA agent glared at me and said ""No"". This airport is terrible when it comes to customer service long waits and handling people with disabilities.",,0
boston-logan-airport,A ODea,United States,I have been flying weekly for the past 20 years. Logan Airport is the worst airport I've used. The Airport ramp from 93 is constantly being closed in the morning forcing the traveling public to weave through side streets to South Boston where detours are never posted the TSA Screeners are among the rudest dehumanizing persons the lines at security are long and disorganized the parking is expensive and limited. Add to that Airline terminals especially recent ones are not well marked on signs.,,0
boston-logan-airport,James Williamson,United Kingdom,Arrived from Tampa en route to Glasgow via Keflavik. No signage from domestic to international.

boston-logan-airport,D Witman,United States,I hate Logan Airport but we had to take it for this last trip. It's one of the worst airports I have ever been in. Traffic logistics crowd management security lines everything cramped and insane. All bad. Whenever we can we travel out of Manchester HY Providence RI or even Hartford CT - anything to not have to go in to Logan. It's a nightmare just trying to get there but when you do finally arrive it makes the hellish drive in seem like a walk down the yellow brick road.,,0
boston-logan-airport,Josh Morrison,United States,Experiences can vary here as wait lines can be long depending on the time of the year. Personally I've never had any real issues here though know people who have. There are some decent amenities to keep you busy and plenty of bars/restaurants in all terminals I believe. Flown domestic and international to and from this airport.,8,1
boston-logan-airport,C Luca,United States,BOS-FCO Terminal E 29 July 2013. Check in was very fast. Security at the airport only took around 5-10 minutes. The departures level at Logan is very nice. There are many food options and facilities of your choice with many spectacular views of the planes gates and runways. A lot of seating near all gates. Boarding to Rome took around 15 minutes. FCO-BOS Terminal E 22 August 2013. Arrived at Terminal E on time from our flight. When got to US Customs it was very busy but only a few desks were available. Took around 15-20 minutes. Then we see this big line of people in a zig zag line to get to the arrivals level. Many passengers were frustrated with the crazy line. It went by fast though and we finally exited to the Arrivals level. Was very clean and was happy to be back in Boston.,9,1
boston-logan-airport,J Smith,United States,The security lines are very long and you have to go out and be re-screened at each terminal. Airlines have people in the area trying to help. TSA could care less. Typical government bureaucracy.,5,0
boston-logan-airport,M Paterson,United Kingdom,Arrived terminal A from Heathrow on 16th May at midday to be met by 40 empty immigration desks. (One opened to process the crew) by 12.30 still no staff by this time another two planes had arrived (Toronto and Amsterdam) the lines getting longer still no staff! About 13.00 a couple of staff made an appearance making a big show of unpacking their coffee flasks logging on etc no eye contact at all. By 13.30 a few more appeared and went through the same routine. Roughly 13.45 they started to process passengers with usual surly attitude. I have never met such a bunch of disgruntled didn't want to be there employees in all my travels both civilian and military.,3,0
boston-logan-airport,J Knack,United States,We connected through Logan from BWI to Dublin and on the return. No problems but it is odd that when changing terminals you have to leave the secure area and go through security again. That said the airport is clean has a great wine bar and a good number of food choices. There was a long security line on the return leg but it moved quickly.,8,1
boston-logan-airport,D Sengupta,India,Have used this airport multiple times in the last few months and think its definitely one of the easiest to use airports in the United States. Other than the really long lines for security checks there isn't much wrong with the place. Much cleaner and brighter than most of the older airports better connected to the city (free bus service on arrival!) and tons of food options.,7,1
boston-logan-airport,C Binhammer,Canada,We flew through Boston Logan en-route to Toronto. By far the friendliest staff we have ever encountered and very helpful. Never before had a customs agent greet us by name and inquire about our holiday. Excellent meal at the airport as well.,9,1
boston-logan-airport,Pontian Hotz,Switzerland,I used Logan Airport every year when I return back to Boston from Vacation. I fly a direct flight from ZRH- BOS. The forms you get at the airport are sometimes very frustrating. The Immigration Services Employees are indeed quite sarcastic and rough. But the Baggage came quite fast and quick. The return to Switzerland was quite bumpy. The security screening took ages and we were standing in line which filled a part of the terminal. Airside was also quite basic with not much to do. A big plus point is the view from the terminal. You can see traffic outside and the boats sailing and cruising next to the airport. That helped to forget to be angry at the poor WIFI connection.,6,1
boston-logan-airport,Paul Whiteley,United Kingdom,"Landside was fine. Used the water taxi service from Rowe's Wharf to the Transportation Dock and then the courtesy airport bus to Terminal E which was fine. Check-in Immigration and Security was polite friendly and efficient. However the paucity of drink/food outlets air-side was dire. Other than the excellent ""Vino Volo"" there was a sandwich place and a Sbarro's. No other sit-down drinking/eating facility.",6,1
boston-logan-airport,E Hardie,United States,Flew into BOS on JetBlue. Surprised at how much better the airport has become in the last few months. The airport always seems to be working at becoming a better airport which is good but that means a lot of construction. The airport was quick and easy except for the rental car place. It was a long bus ride but the hard part was getting out of the parking lot. Other than that Boston is proving to be a wonderful airport that I hope to fly into and out of again.,6,1
boston-logan-airport,John Pierson,United States,"We live near Boston and fly in and out of it frequently on a combination of national and international flights. All the negative reactions do not reflect our experience. We particularly like the speed with which we can clear immigration and customs. Transportation to the ""T"" (subway) is efficient. International departures can be busy and the lines not well observed at times. We have always found the people helpful and friendly.",8,1
boston-logan-airport,P Lolschou,United States,Worst airport - bring hiking shoes for long walks between terminals bring patience for slow security scanners bring a GPS to compensate for poor information signs and monitors bring earplugs for screaming security personnel (that's everywhere in domestic airports these days).,1,0
boston-logan-airport,E Biafore,United States,Flew BDA-BOS-DTW with a 3 hour layover in BOS. For a major airport facilities very basic. Eating places limited to a couple of fast-food places and restaurants with very very limited menus. Other than that airport was clean and staff were okay.,5,0
boston-logan-airport,J Fissore,United States,Boston Logan basically has the facilities services and operations of a regional airport whilst serving a major metropolitan area. Good attributes include the airport's proximity to the city the array of kiosks the ease of walking around and finding your way and quite good eating options. All that aside this airport is gruelling and disturbingly bad. The shopping experience is sub-par the airport is dirty restrooms are hard to find and the selection of destinations/flights is actually quite poor. These are nothing compared to the staff. Whether it the sarcastic rude customs officers disgruntled employees who will not want to help you. Overall a pretty disappointing airport.,3,0
boston-logan-airport,David Jones,Spain,Arrival at Terminal E was ok with a 20 minute wait for immigration. Excellent connections to get to the city. Departure Terminal B departure lounge is like a fast food court. TSA brutal making sarcastic remarks and making fun of passengers. They seem power crazy and are quite intimidating. I was berated for asking a question with the agent telling me off for speaking to him whilst he was checking the screen. There was nobody else to ask and they pause it often enough so could he not have done that then? Great time in Boston but marred by TSA on departure.,6,1
boston-logan-airport,Evan Hardie,United States,Driving to the airport was a nightmare and the rental car place is too far away. The roads at the airport are confusing and getting in and out is very hard. The security is the worst part. It took practically forever to get through and we got to the airport 75 minutes ahead of time. We were running to the gate. The only positives were the stores and food court and the people at the rental car facility were very nice and helpful.,5,0
boston-logan-airport,S Triantafyllou,United States,"Rude invasive customs officers always making sarcastic remarks and always with a ""suspicious"" attitude towards everyone. Overall airport is accessible and features some decent restaurants. Sub-par duty-free long waits at check-in security and baggage claim as well as customs. Overall if Newark can handle many more passengers in a much more humane fashion Boston should start thinking about changing policies.",3,0
boston-logan-airport,L Rupert,United States,Security queue was long and agents rude. They found an empty water bottle on a passenger and instead of allowing him to throw it away sent him to the back of the line. They called one of our party for further screening and they yelled at me for not moving my bags (I have a fractured spine and use a cane). When I said I was disabled I had 3 people offer me a chair to sit and watch my bags. The bags were blocking up the conveyor so I asked if one of them could put them on the ground they ignored me apparently they may not touch your bags after they've inspected them? There was in general a lot of snarling crankiness and rudeness from the staff. Airport operated shuttle was packed and grimy airport in general was not the cleanest.,2,0
boston-logan-airport,L Bateman,United States,Immigration agents appear to be disgruntled and are taking it out on the travelers. Horrible line management and understaffing of lines while multiple agents make a big display of leaving for the day.,5,1
boston-logan-airport,Derek Lightfoot,United Kingdom,I use this airport about once a year and I find it good with the exception of international arrivals. The Ted Williams tunnel makes connecting by road to the I90 and I93 simple. Taxi times can be long but airlines usually allow for this in their schedules. However immigration is a disgrace. On my last trip I was near the front of the queue and still took more than 30mins to clear. Some of the officers seemed to be on a deliberate go slow. A number of flights arrived just after us and by the time I left it looked like people at the back of our queue would have several hours to wait.,4,0
boston-logan-airport,Peter Nakhili,United States,Boston's Logan International Airport is a fairly decent airport. It offers a variety of regional and international flights. The parking is a hassle and is expensive in my opinion. Other than that they have buses and shuttles that will take you to terminals car rental places and hotels. The terminals are easy to navigate as is the whole airport. There is usually a long line at the security check but moves fast and is no problem. Taxiing on the the tarmac is a different story. There are lines and they cane take long. Once I had to sit at the gate on the plane for an hour after arriving from New York's JFK Airport. Only a couple of flaws.,3,0

boston-logan-airport,C Hill,United States,"Flying out of Boston Logan on March 11 was a nightmare. They have the new body scanners and TSA staff don't know how to use them and then they did not have back-up when the one in our line went down. The lines were backed up to the front doors and when we finally made it to put our items on the security line - they were letting other passengers in front of us. After we had been in line for 1hour 20 minutes - with no explanations why. Everyone was upset. Then after the whole body scanner everyone got a body search. 2 lines over however they didn't have the ""new scanners"" so people were going thru those lines very quickly. The attendants and TSA staff bringing other passengers in front of us would not explain and in some cases ignored questions from passengers seeking answers.",2,0
boston-logan-airport,J Quinlan,,Terminal A Delta baggage check-in staff attempted $150 shakedown - failed when finally got it thru to them that each passenger is entitled to 2 check-in bags for International flight. First agent named took her lunch break in the middle of checking our luggage! Said she had been working since 4am and at 9am always takes her break then left us with another agent who proceeded to try to shake us down for $150 extra bag-when we were only carrying the allowance and all bags were under weight limits. After insisting we pay her over several minutes each time my reply was we had the legal number of bags she finally realized she was wrong but did not apologize.,1,0
boston-logan-airport,F Pastizzo,,I have flown in and out of Logan a lot. I have twice suggested Logan adopt an inside-security shuttle between concourses to put an end to their double TSA screening of connecting passengers. I clear TSA at my home airport and am forced to leave security upon arrival and walk a mile or wait for an inconsistent outside-the-terminal shuttle bus and get back into a TSA line with hundreds of people. They are creating their own turmoil. SEA-TAC shuttles people from one gate at one concourse to another gate at another concourse. People remain screened and secured between concourses.,2,0
boston-logan-airport,L Middleton,,"Found the airport to be fast efficient and clean. Signage easy to understand and baggage arrived quickly. Only issue is with the taxis. A US$3.50 ""exit tax"" added to every fare plus another $4 toll to go through one of the tunnels into Boston. BOS to Long Wharf / Ferry terminals (a 10 minute ride) is about US$30 with tip. I'm guessing $6 a mile at least.",4,0

boston-logan-airport,Alex Keane,,Although Boston Logan is a rather large international airport (though not as large as JFK LAX and Heathrow) it is designed to feel as if it is not a chaotic bustling place. The security check-in and lounges are placed conveniently to the point that if you are making use of one. TSA people were professional and organized as well as the valet help desk and information. Two gripes - the baggage claim signal is rather annoying in that it goes for 15 blares and the Massport officials are still working on a design plan for the B terminal. They need to remodel it soon! Signage from the Mass Pike and the city are superb and the whole place is a delight to navigate.,5,0
boston-logan-airport,Steve Koenig,,As mentioned an adequate airport. I would describe it as one of the smaller major airports-- at least that is the impression gets within one of the individual separated terminals. Not a large variety of shops and restaurants but enough to get by. Taxis into town are expensive but there is also the Silver Line bus/trolley into the waterfront area and which connections to the regular subway system and a free (I think) bus that goes to another subway stop on a different line.,4,0
boston-logan-airport,Dennis Swenson,,Surprisingly fast queue through immigration/passport/customs despite many hundreds of people arriving from other transatlantic flights then a 10 minute taxi ride to my downtown hotel. Return flight even better! A 15 minute taxi ride to Logan and the new very nice Virgin Clubroom. What a place to wait for boarding!,5,0
boston-logan-airport,G Senior,,Flew in and out in late June with minimal queues both ways and helpful staff. The only criticism is the limited range of shops in the international departure lounge and that all the airline lounges are windowless.,4,0
boston-logan-airport,R Yancy,,Flew into Boston from Philadelphia and flew out of Boston to Charlotte both with US Airways. Facilities within the airport are nice. However if one had to connect in Boston with two different airlines it would be horrific as the airport is divided up between 5 or 6 separate terminals with no way to get from one to the other without leaving security from one and having to re-enter security at another.,3,0
boston-logan-airport,Vicky Hawkes,,A reasonable airport which serves its function satisfactorily. Immigration was quick and painless and without the usual aggressive cross-questioning I get as a solo female traveller - a great relief. The information desk was open and the staff member helpful and I got a taxi into town almost straight away. The return leg was okay - KLM/NWA check-in is self-service and efficient - but was slightly dampened by the disorganised security staff (how many times must people show their boarding passes?!) and lack of choice of somewhere to eat after passport control; but eventually Houlihan's proved a reasonable option with friendly bar staff and quick service. The rocking chairs in the departure lounge were a nice touch.,4,0
boston-logan-airport,C Chang,,Have been a frequent LHR to Logan passenger for years the last 3 with a child. The only good thing going for Logan is the short walk from the gate to immigration. Otherwise Logan is surprisingly incredibly baby/child-unfriendly particularly when one is travelling on one's own. Baggage handling takes forever. The pushchair promised immediately on exiting the aircraft as at LHR never materializes. It doesn't arrive in the baggage hall until LONG after the last of the baggage have cleared somewhat battered. It's not easy trying to carry a car seat with a baby in it hand luggage and gather baggage simultaneously. Other passengers waiting in the same predicament often take pity and offer help which is just as well as the personnel are insolent and unsympathetic. After 3 journeys of said experience I gave up and bought a Sit 'N Stroll but continue to see families waiting forlornly for their pushchairs to arrive. This is in contrast to LHR a much- maligned airport where I've always had every assistance I required as soon as I stepped off the plane,2,0
boston-logan-airport,A Johnson,,BOS is my home airportt. I find it a perfectly functional airport but not terribly exciting. Some terminals (A E Landside) are newly renovated and quite nice while others (B) are in need of work. I've always been able to check in quickly and baggage delivery has usually been prompt. There are an adequate assortment of shops and restaurants though some of them are landside rather than airside (such as the Boston Landing area in Terminal C). I've found the TSA staff at this airport to be among the more professional and efficient in the country. Coming off international flights clearing customs is a matter of hit or miss. I've made it from the plane to the curb in less that 15 minutes but other times it's taken an hour. Transit access to this airport from downtown has improved since the institution of the Silver Line though it is still a bus subject to the same pitfalls of traffic and slow boarding as the Massport shuttle to the Blue Line.,3,0
boston-logan-airport,T Atmore,,Flew into Boston from UK on the Friday evening before Independence Day when thought it would be busy. What a breeze. The view of the city upon landing is spectacular in the setting sun! Was off the aircraft through Immigration and Baggage Reclaim and into Arrivals Hall in less than 30 minutes. The best thing about Logan Airport is its proximity to the city - so much better than DC and both Newark and JFK. Took approximately 20 minutes by taxi to arrive at hotel. Very pleasant experience and wouldn't hesitate to fly into Logan again if visiting the East Coast.,4,0
boston-logan-airport,Rick Phillips,,Flew into Logan on Luftansa via Munich. Quick no-hassle experience through very pleasant customs/immigration arrivals area; easy connection to Memphis via Northwest. Dramatic Terminal E ticketing area; comfortable NW departures area though somewhat confusing to find. Logan really needs to provide escalators connecting international departures (where most of the food/shopping is located) with NW domestic departures instead of that hidden elevator. Luckily staff very helpful and courteous. Much easier/less stressful than the usual JFK connections.,4,0
boston-logan-airport,Lars Johansson,,"Keep in mind that the following opnions are based on my experiences from Friday March 16th and Saturday March 17th when the Northeastern US was hit by a severe snowstorm: BOS did not handle the bad weather situation well. Information provided was erratic if at all available. Flights that were cancelled were not listed as cancelled on the information monitors. They were simply taken off the monitors once cancelled. The airline staff told us that this was the way Massport the company in charge of BOS Operations always did it. One flight was listed with an arrival time of 6:30 pm until 6:40 pm despite that the airline staff knew that the same flight had not even departed from the airport it had been diverted to in the midst of the storm. The Massport staff assigned to the public information desks were extremely unhelpful and explained all problems with the incorrect information on the arrival/departure monitors as ""it's in the computers""! I can accept that a bad weather situation is extremely stressfull to any airport. But the unprofessionalism exhibited by BOS/Massport is totally unacceptable.",,0
boston-logan-airport,Jim Kenney,,Used BOS for BOS-FRA earlier this month returning yesterday. Terminal E's upgrades are nearing completion now Massport is putting new wall coverings up and new flooring at the Northwest section of the terminal. Boarding was not as chaotic as before and escalators were installed at this gate as well (departure lounge on level 3 boarding and CBP on level 2). On arrival the CBP immigration hall was empty. I have never seen it so empty before. I was literally through immigration 45 seconds after I entered the hall. The bag claim/customs hall is almost fully completed; there is a temporary wall beyond carousel 6 but other than that Terminal E is nearly done and has come a long way.,,0
boston-logan-airport,Jim Kenney,,"Used Terminal E for BOS-CDG-BOS. The terminal's interior upgrading is almost complete. Food quality is good. If you have time go to Houlihans if not plenty of other locations to choose. Shopping was alright but not much in the way of books except outside security. Boarding was slightly chaotic since we used gate 6 which looks as if it were placed arbitrarily. A note here terminal E gates with the exception of Northwest (the only permanant carrier there) are not leased to the airlines hence the lack of airline signage. Also the ground employees are not employees of the carrier. They are local employees assigned to carriers. I encountered a Lufthansa ground crewmember who told me she actually works for GlobeGround. She spoke German as do I but when I asked her if fluent German was a requirement she replied ""you don't even have to be fluent in English"". Kinda unsettling. Flight departed on time the return went alright however Customs still has not staffed the arrivals hall fully. While I realize this is not JFK it is no excuse to understaff the immigration hall. Especially when 4 flights arrive at the same time. Other than that it went well. The Airport Subway Station has come a long way and is very nice. Take it if you are trying to get downtown. Otherwise the Silver Line is also quite comfortable. Take it to South Station.",,0
boston-logan-airport,Jim Kenney,,BOS-JFK-BUR on JetBlue out of Terminal C. JetBlue's upgrades are becoming visable. There is now a Johnny Rockets a Wolfgang Puck and a Starbucks next to gate 28. A permanent Dunkin Donuts is under construction next to gate 29 (currently there's a DD kiosk). There is also construction across from security where the Sam Adams used to be. At the end of this year JetBlue has announced that it will be taking over Continental's Terminal C gates giving them more space to work with. The security line at C hasn't been too bad the last few times ive flown out of Logan. My only gripe about Logan is that AirTran was kicked out of the United bag claim and is now in with jetBlue clogging the arrival hall every time they get a flight.,,0
boston-logan-airport,Neil Thomas,,Had the misfortune to use Logan airport twice recently - what a disgrace! Over an hour to get through immigration then sent to the wrong terminal for connecting flight. 45 minutes to get through next security check with staff that simply throw your hand luggage around or stand chatting and rude in the extreme. All this caused us to miss our connection and we were made to fell it was our fault!! Same problems on the way back. If this is the first view visitors get of the USA I bet many want to turn straight back. What a shambles.,,0
boston-logan-airport,Peter Creedon,,Had to use Logan for a flight from STL-ACK. Terminal B is chaotic. I almost got lost trying to find the Terminal C walkway. Inside Terminal C there is a Burger King Sam Adams Dunkin' Donuts Starbucks and Legal Seafoods. The Burger King is alright. My Advice is to eat at Legal Seafoods if you have time. Security At Terminal C is very organized. I forgot to mention that in the long hallway area the Check in desks are all in one central island. The gates are well laid out and the Cape Air gate area is well maintained. It's in the Continental Connection area near Midwest.,,0
bourgas-airport,Doug Knock,United Kingdom,Airport is not greatest - currently outdoor seating is shut so were stuck inside in airless area for 2 hours. Toilets not great water very expensive and I have been short changed (admittedly 4 years ago). It's improved a little but long way to go.,3,0
bourgas-airport,L Lockwood,,Baggage claim took over an hour and the decor in the arrivals lounge is third world. In the departures area it took ages to check in and in the lounge itself there are hardly any shops and equally a very poor standard of decoration. Worst airport I have been in.,1,0
bourgas-airport,Alexander Olaisen,,On arrival baggage claim took over an hour and it was extremely warm. On check-in two weeks later it took approx 50 min.

Possibly among the worst international airports I've been to.,1,0
bourgas-airport,Markus Flatscher,,A smart little airport. The baggage claim on our arrival took quite long because the baggage- conveyor-belts are very small. Check-in one week later was very quick. Despite its size the airport is a bit confusing because of its soviet architecture.,3,0

bournemouth-airport,P Cullen,United Kingdom,"My first experience of this airport is very positive, at odds with most recent reviews but I would be very happy to use it again (and hope to). The car park is fairly expensive but no more than other airports in southern England and it is 2-3 minutes walk to the terminal. We had pre-printed boarding cards and walked straight through security and were in the departure hall within 10 minutes of leaving the car and that included stopping to buy a paper and having a chat with the very friendly security staff about our destination. The flight was delayed by about an hour, but that is not the airport's fault, and it was a nice environment in which to wait, plenty of seating and a reasonable café. Returning was even better, no queue at all for passport checks and in the car under ten minutes from leaving the aircraft.",8,1
bournemouth-airport,Garry Holloway,United Kingdom,I totally agree with the reviews posted regarding the surly staff at check in and the comments regarding clear plastic bags (they change the goal posts constantly) drop off charges etc the only smiling staff employed there are in the the main bar/food area. Do management ever read or act on these reviews or do they not care enough about their customers as they have a pretty good captive market?,,0
bournemouth-airport,P Blakey,United Kingdom,What a shambles! I flew to Antalya on the Thursday Thomson flight two weeks ago. After last year we decided to get to the airport at 11.20am for the 2.15pm flight. Check-in (fast bag drop?) opened at 11.35 we were 3rd in the line so we were through quickly despite only one functioning check-in agent. After a nice relaxed lunch we sat down in the gate area with 5 mins to boarding and were joined by an old lady who was distressed as she had arrived at 12.00 to be faced with the slow check-in and security. This was our experience last year. The old lady had just enough time to use the toilet before boarding. A neighbour of ours went a week later and they took 1 3/4 hours to get through. What a shame our local airport is a disgrace they don't care about their customers just maximum profit. Try to find an alternative airport or check-in like we did 3hrs ahead.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,P Anderson,Spain,My flight was cancelled - due to fly out at 17.50 and we were kept in the dark as to what was happening an hour later proposed flight time of 20.00 was given. This came and went still no information given no offer of food vouchers or hot drinks. The bar/cafe closed only the goodwill of the staff in WH Smiths allowed us to purchase drinks and snacks. Then it was announced that our flight would be the following morning and hotel accommodation was being sought. We then had to queue to say who wanted accommodation. Still no offer of food the Airport Manager arrived a lot later and hot drinks were made available about 11.45. I was in the first taxi to a hotel and was in the hotel by 00.15 being told to be ready for collection to airport at 05.00. On arrival we had to queue again to collect new boarding cards (this was not conveyed either the night before or on arrival at the airport) no one knew the time of our flight and no one seemed to want to speak to us again no offer of food or hot drink vouchers. Eventually we were told we could purchase food and claim back from Ryanair! Flight took off at 08.30! Altogether a bad experience mainly caused by not being kept informed of progress.,,0
bournemouth-airport,R Thoms,United Kingdom,Congratulations Bournemouth Airport at least you appear consistent. From the rip-off access charge and surly staff upon departure to the urine stained toilets and dog-end strewn arrivals exit area it was a thoroughly unpleasant experience.,,0
bournemouth-airport,Elizabeth Egbe,Greece,I suffer with heart failure and walking more than 20 metres (especially in the wind and rain) is very challenging why no drop off/pick up zone from disabled zone. Sign posting not clear inside and outside. I had to remove my flip flops why me and not others. I have difficulty standing on one foot no chair offered. Overzealous staff. Bournemouth airport will continue to be a 'backwater' airport if it remains so unprofessional. The screen informing you of your gate call instructs you to 'relax eat and shop'! The tables in the common waiting area were dirty and covered in beer glasses and crumbs from snacks.,2,0
bournemouth-airport,Julie Bartle,United Kingdom,"Totally agree with rip off parking for drop off. What a scam. The staff checking your passports and boarding passes need a lesson in customer service too. I travelled with Ryanair last month with hand luggage only. I put my liquids in a zip lock freezer bag that I've been using for the last few years only to be told by the ""jobs worth"" man that it was too big and I'd need to ""buy"" yes that's right ""buy"" 2 bags for £1! The bags that other airports give you for ""free"" So I did and decanted my freezer bag into the 2 flimsy rip off bags and went through ok. I was not happy at all though. I was especially annoyed by the superior attitude of the jobsworths there. So last week I flew with good old Ryanair again and used my 2 purchased bags from my previous flight you know the ones that I had to buy for £1 and guess what? I was told by a miserable member of staff a woman that I wasn't allowed to take 2 bags. So I told her about my previous flight and asked why I could only take 1. She informed me with a bleak expression that that was the rule. So if that's the case why can't one buy 1 flimsy plastic bag for 50p. The staff are sadly lacking in good customer service. They also need to be consistent and stop ripping off people. I use Bournemouth as it's close to where I live but if Ryanair and Thomson operated out of Southampton then I'd definitely use that airport. Bournemouth needs to improve.",,0
bournemouth-airport,Eric Sanderson,United Kingdom,I dropped off my family in the car-park and went to pay at the exit. I had cash of £2.50 and found it is card only. Not having my wallet I stated I have cash only. The instruction I was given was to return to the short term car-park and pay there. Where is the short term car-park as I tried to return to the drop off zone and of course the barrier only operates one way. On my return to the exit and by this time extremely annoyed the barrier suddenly opened and I was free. Its bad enough having to pay to drop people off but to feel imprisoned is something else. Please for the sake of other people arrange for cash payments to be made.,,0
bournemouth-airport,G Chaundy,United Kingdom,"Bournemouth Airport is like a Mickey Mouse service operating in a third world country! Exorbitant Car Parking costs and no Pedestrian access are the first obvious signs that you are going to be ripped off. I am here to drop off my wife and sister for a short break and a flight to Dublin. Arriving in the Departure Hall is like visiting a vacant planet - 12.15pm and not a sole in sight anywhere. Eventually one will spot a Departure/Arrivals board with possibly all 3 flights showing! You may have some time to kill (don't you always at airports) so you wander over to the only outlet ""Joe's"" only to be greeted by an attendant who appears to have better things to do than speak with customers! Told they haven't got any food as the delivery is late. We make our way to an enquiry desk - 2 ladies appear to be engaged in critical discussion so being the only other people there - we stand and wait and wait until finally one lady looks at us as though we were aliens and virtually demands with a yes! Can you tell me when the baggage drop for this flight opens - I ask. 1.20 she replies looking at her watch - it is 1.22! Without further ado she totally ignores us walks from behind the enquiry desk - across the concourse - and opens up the check-in desk! I will not bother telling you about the debate on baggage weights and Cabin or Hold Luggage but suffice to say its Southampton Airport for me in future.",,0
bournemouth-airport,L Joyce,United Kingdom,I know that the security info for airports from the government must change on a daily basis however the people who work at Bournemouth International Airport clearly don't want their jobs if recent experience is anything to go by. I have had the experience of this by flying out of there twice in a month. Once to Ibiza in June with Ryannair and I have just got back from Corfu flying with Thomson. I remember the days of Bath Travel when flying from Bournemouth was such a luxury. Having an airport not ten minutes away from your home and with happy smiling people was such a novelty. Since it has been sold to Manchester Airports I have noticed a very big decline in Customer Service. Lets start with the airport itself. To pay £2.50 for half an hour drop off is just a rip off and encourages people to be dropped off at the road before the airport. In the grand scheme of things £2.50 is not a lot but when hardly any other airport in Britain does this it makes you feel that you are somehow being scammed. The toilets are fine but there is simply not enough of them especially when it comes to last minute. I do like the Duty Free shop and the WH Smith the cafe is also fine and very clean with a wide range of dishes. When I flew to Ibiza in June I had my trusty clear sandwich bag which I have used at Gatwick various terminals at Heathrow and Southampton. This wasn't an issue here. Fast forward three weeks later to last week where I was stopped and told that my clear bag was too big and I needed to buy one of their bags for £1. (Gatwick and Heathrow hand these bags out for free so yes another way for Bournemouth to make money out of you). When I tried to say that I had used it three weeks before and it was fine the security guy simply told me that the other person shouldn't have let me through. I get the feeling that it depends which jobsworth you have on that day. Now my real reason for deciding to complain is the fact that Bournemouth airport offers online check in. We had reserved seats for both flights but checked in anyway to print the boarding passes. 20 minutes later I have filled in all their questions online with our details etc however unlike the big airports they don't offer a 'bag drop which I wasn't aware of and isn't mentioned online and which also meant that we still had to queue for 40 minutes and then a further 20 minutes at the check in desk while the Check in Clerk weighed our bags hand luggage checked our passports and documents even though we had already printed out our boarding passes. All this was done without a word or a smile. I don't see the point in offering a 'check in online' service if you still have to go through the usual process. The airport is simply too small and the airlines cannot be bothered to provide enough staff I am afraid that this has turned me back to the biggies or even Southampton. The only advantage to this airport is that it is so close to home. I will happily travel the distance to Gatwick again.,2,0
bournemouth-airport,W Tyrer,Spain,We arrived on foot at Bournemouth Airport to find no pedestrian access and were forced to walk the last 100m in the road to get to the terminal putting us at risk of an accident. The security staff were slow unhelpful and unpleasant and the searches overzealous otherwise OK.,,0
bournemouth-airport,D Smith,United Kingdom,Hurn Airport has never been great and is weak when compared with Southampton Airport. Their new 'dangerous to walk' to the Airport route to force people to drive in (footways have been removed). Lack of integrated transport options (no connecting buses relating to flights). Overzealous searches at any opportunity. The specified 20cm x 20cm plastic bag requirement for liquids (if it isn't you go to the back of the queue). Staff complaining to each other that there are too many people going through the checkpoint when a plane is scheduled to take off and also when you land why are you subjected to a 40 minute wait at Border Control and the queue goes across the apron for a least 15 of those minutes. Bournemouth - If you want to attract customers you need to take a serious look at your services and make travelling a delight. You are far from this.,,0
bournemouth-airport,K Hutchings,United Kingdom,I would recommend Bournemouth Airport but not the Swissport check in - we checked in for the Thomson Gran Canaria flight on Monday 1st April at 6.am. Unfortunately out of the 3 check in rows we got into the Swissport one. Our baggage including hand luggage was 3 Kilos overweight. Our own fault we hadn't purchased extra weight in advance. We told her we were quite prepared to pay the charge but no there would be no sport in that! The check in staff membber had us moving things from one bag to another. Then after all this charged us££39 which we could have paid 10 minutes before. The woman was extremely rude and quite unprofessional. On our return flight from Gran Canaria our luggage weighed the same as the outward trip and our hand luggage was not even weighed.,5,1
bournemouth-airport,P Baker,United Kingdom,On 7th April I arrived to pick someone up from Bournemouth Airport - a quick 5-minute job for which I had to pay £2.50 of course. But we found that we couldn't move out of the car park. There was a long queue of cars ahead of us and nothing moved. It was raining heavily and we didn't fancy getting out to investigate at first but eventually did and found that the exit barrier wasn't working. Nobody was doing anything to rectify this. After about half an hour some staff arrived to sort it out. Nobody offered any explanation or apology to anyone about this at all. One man who complained to the staff was treated quite rudely. I don't think much of the airport procedures if they cannot sort something like this quickly - perhaps re-route the cars out of the car park or lift the barrier manually or something. It's typical of airports that when there are delays nobody explains properly what the problem is and nobody apologises. Don't think we will use Bournemouth again.,,0
bournemouth-airport,C Hallett,United Kingdom,The airport is convenient for us and we use it at least 3 times a year. However the parking/drop down charges are extortionate and unavoidable - great to have monopoly power isn't it. Similar airports allow free drop downs or 10 minutes free parking - as Bournemouth used to. If you use a car park other than the ones at Bournemouth you are required to undertake a dangerous walk with baggage to the airport in order to avoid charges. This drop down charge really needs to be changed - it immediately puts travellers in a bad mood. The facilities have steadily improved over the years and although eating is quite expensive you don't have to buy their food. I have not found queuing to be any worse than at any other airport - return queues are long because of security restrictions. You can always arrive early to avoid long queues on the outward journey. I have found Southampton airport to be the best local one easy to get to by train and helpful staff. Bournemouth could learn from them.,2,0
bournemouth-airport,John Jacobs,Spain,We returned from Malaga on a flight that arrived at 8.25 in the evening. Once we has passed through the security and collected our bags we found no Taxi or bus service( buses only run until 7pm in the evening.) THEN had to endure 45 mins outside in the freezing cold for a taxi along with about 20 other people And they have the cheek to call this Bournemouth International Airport I don't think so. Why they cannot have Taxis waiting when they know flights are arriving what about people that have no transport or anyone to collect them.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,Denise Hope,United Kingdom,I live in Bournemouth and think we have done a great deal of good with our airport of late however on arriving back on Sunday morning from Malaga there were a fair number of non UK residents on my flight imagine the impression it presents when they get to the baggage hall to first find only 1 female toilet and then not in a good clean condition in addition no toilet paper just an empty spool I take on board this was 9.10am however I assume we are at some stage going to get an update of the arrivals hall but this is no excuse for not have the facilities clean and tidy. Not a good start to the start of their stay with us.,5,1
bournemouth-airport,M Feltham,United Kingdom,This was the very first time we have ever flown from Bournemouth Airport. We (3 adults and 3 Children) flew out of Bournemouth on Friday 13th. As much as we had our reservations flying on this date we can honestly say that it is one of the best airports we have flown from. After reading all of the negative reviews prior to the 13th we were apprehensive however utilising a little common sense we viewed Ryanair's baggage allowance and also printed a copy to take along should there be any disagreement at the airport. Arriving 2 hours prior to departure there were no issues / arguments / disagreements in fact everything was fab. The airport staff throughout were friendly and helpful. We will be flying from Bournemouth again following our experience.,10,1
bournemouth-airport,Peter Blakey,United Kingdom,They don't care about their customers. This is our local airport so I try and use it when I can. We flew out to Turkey on 5th September. We arrived at 11.50am for our 2.04pm flight so we thought we were in plenty of time wrong again. It took us until 1.30pm to get through checking and security. Then when we got into departures we were called for boarding straight away. No time for a meal or a browse around the shops.,,0
bournemouth-airport,M Goodliffe,United Kingdom,I live in Bournemouth but travel to Southampton or London for flights. I've used Bournemouth a few times and end up starting my holiday in a foul mood so I now avoid it like the plague. This airport is an embarrassment to local people and I feel ashamed that any overseas travellers should experience the petty penny pinching ethos of this airport. No drop off and pick up point extortionate short term car parking fees charges for plastic bags to put makeup etc in disgusting food in the cafeteria at extortionate prices to name but a few. I have to pick up a friend on Saturday and am annoyed already that I'm going to be charged car parking even if she's waiting on the pavement. Never will I use this airport again!,,0
bournemouth-airport,P Roberts,United Kingdom,Bournemouth airport. Rip off for clear bags. Charges. You have to pay £2.50 to even drop off at the door - ie. you can't drop off. You then have to pay £1 for clear plastic bags for liquid!,,0
bournemouth-airport,N Shaw,United Kingdom,I have flown from various airports in the UK but was persuaded to come all the way from Manchester to fly from Bournemouth. I have never seen anything like it from been ripped off for because you to have to pay for parking to be dropped off and picked up to no information boards upon arrival to show you where to go and what check-in to use. They should be at the front entry points to the airport as in all other airports! At the time we returned there was only our flight in but it took ages for the baggage to appear and to clear passport control. I hope you don't need the toilet on your return they only have 1 toilet for each sex and a toilet for the disabled in the baggage hall.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,B Gillam,United Kingdom,This is a small local airport that's very convenient for local people to use and avoid having to go to Gatwick or Heathrow. Southampton Airport is not very far away and the facilities there are so much better and they have a free drop off zone which is under cover. So much better than Bournemouth. The approach road into Bournemouth Airport has traffic cones all the way down each side and the centre of the road making it look like a motorway under repair and that's to prevent motorists stopping to drop people off without using their expensive car park. There's no pathway from the main road either so anyone dropped off outside the airport has no walkway but has to walk in the road instead and risk the dangers of traffic. This is not a customer friendly way of getting to the airport. Get rid of those cones and provide a free passenger drop off zone if you want repeat custom at the airport. Remember Southampton Airport is not far away.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,Paul Hatvany,United Kingdom,I fly about a dozen times a year and this is the first time I have used Bournemouth Airport. I was searched at security on a random basis by a young man who must have been a trainee. He took over five minutes and clearly did not have a clue what he was doing. The experience was not pleasant and would be unheard of at any of the more used airports.,,0
bournemouth-airport,M Kewley,France,Most of these reviews seem to focus on the rip off parking system comments with which I don't disagree. That said I would happily pay 10 pounds to park/be dropped off if I thought there was even the faintest chance that I would make it onto an aircraft without getting into an argument with a pedant about the size or weight of my suitcase or the plastic bag not surrounding my single pot of hair wax or the failure to put my boarding pass inside the photo page of the passport before having to practically take off all my clothes at x- ray and open and taste 8 pots of baby food and be pushed around by a bunch of miserable jobsworth staff in the longest queue for security ever seen in an airport with no passengers. I wish they would send the staff at BOH to a proper airport for an afternoon to learn the arts of applying the security and safety guidelines without patronizing and disrespecting all the paying public that pay their wages. This place is an absolute disgrace!,,0
bournemouth-airport,Ken Harrison,United Kingdom,I used to enjoy flying from Bournemouth but now it's a nightmare. Took 75 minutes from joining the check-in at 9.15am to the departure lounge. They could not handle 2 flights at 11.30. Heathrow is expected to deal with that amount of passengers every 5 minutes. Coming back was the same. Ryanair played their usual fanfare claiming the flight was 25 minutes ahead of schedule but we waited 45 minutes for our bags so what was the point in being early? The baggage collection area resembled the inside of a warehouse like those dreadful Spanish airports of 30 years ago. The person who designed Bournemouth needs to go to Spain and learn how things can change!,2,0
bournemouth-airport,J Elkins,United Kingdom,What a miserable airport! The drop off charges are unacceptable. The new buildings are dark and unfriendly. What has happened to the lovely viewing area and the friendly cafe? Won't be hurrying back and would not tell anyone else to use it.,2,0
bournemouth-airport,Simon Ward,United Kingdom,The meet and greet service that I paid an additional £10 plus is a joke. On returning from Cyprus we were in the first 25% to collect our bags and proceeded to collect the keys for our car. We returned to where we had parked the car and it was not there - I told my wife she must be mistaken and we searched the car park for a considerable amount of time before returning to the information desk where it became evident that the car had not been returned to the place we had left it. We paid for this service in order to get away as quickly as possible and were actually the last passengers to leave the airport from our flight at 02.05 in quite a stressed condition. I calculate that this delayed our departure from the airport by approximately 30 minutes and am extremely angry.,2,0
bournemouth-airport,J Spencer,United Kingdom,I had my first experience at Bournemouth recently flying to Ibiza and I have to say I thought it great - such a relief to be in a virtually empty airport! Everything was clean well spaced out and well thought out all services were quick and convenient and I actually quite liked the food I had in the 'pub'! And a great duty free. In all I thought a really simple clean quick un-stressful airport. Compared to Stansted etc it was a breeze.,10,1
bournemouth-airport,D Morris,United Kingdom,Rip off drop off charges expensive outdoor unsecured parking poor public transport connections no pedestrian access and that's just before you start! Inside the airport is like a huge hangar with rows of uncomfortable seating. The restaurant is terrible and there's no comfortable coffee shop. I much prefer Southampton which is so user friendly however for convenience as local travellers we suffer the Bournemouth experience but protest by spending no money there!,2,0
bournemouth-airport,Chris Arnold,United Kingdom,Use this airport frequently as I fly out to Alicante to my holiday villa in Javea. It is very convenient for me as I live in Ringwood (6 miles away) great for getting there in 10 minutes. I can use the shuttle bus as pensioners get it free of charge. If a family member picks me up then I don't begrudge paying £2.50 as the saving in fuel and time is by far greater. The airport is small but has a restaurant with friendly service a newsagent and duty free I have found the staff very polite and informative. Bournemouth is a great place and the airport is excellent.,10,1
bournemouth-airport,Peter Stevens,United Kingdom,A very poor experience today dropping off my family for a flight realising too late that I would be paying £2.50 to do so. There is no way to avoid it no way to turn round. To cap it all one of the ticket payment machines was out of order so what might have been a two minute visit necessitated a walk to another machine to pay my £2.50. I really felt that I'd been screwed by a company that doesn't give two hoots for its customers. I will have to pay again next week to pick up my family but that will be my last ever visit to Bournemouth.,,0
bournemouth-airport,Steven James,United Kingdom,I like this airport. Yes you have to pay £2.50 to drop and pick up but other regional airports now seem to be charging for this as well and I expect it will not be long before major airports follow suit. I save money by not having to travel to Heathrow or Gatwick and save again by being home before even reaching baggage claim in the major airports if my last experience is anything to go by. Bournemouth have helpful staff except the UKBA staff most of whom could do with a refresher in customer service but as they don't work for the airport authority I think it churlish to mark them down on that score. I think where Bournemouth falls down a bit is in the food outlets. It would seem that the cafes and restaurants are run by the same firm I think a bit of competition there might well improve things.,9,1
bournemouth-airport,H Mead,United Kingdom,Bournemouth Airport is owned by Manchester Airport - we are charged 25 pence more for drop off charges (£2.50) than those of Manchester Airport (£2.25). I like travelling with Thomson they are a terrific outfit who will help at every opportunity but I don't like Bournemouth Airport. Over priced over rated and very disappointing. Looking to take my next business and holiday trips from Southampton and Bristol.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,P Thomas,United Kingdom,I am disabled and agreed to see my sister and her husband off on a flight but ended up queuing to enter the £2.50 drop off car park area as cars were waiting to leave the barriered entrance to the main airport as people (rightfully in my opinion) entered the lane approaching the car parking area barrier dropping off there friends and families then reversing into oncoming traffic to exit the only road to this airport. Poorly designed system if you ask me. Just take the money with no regard or thought to the passengers who help keep an airport local let alone allowances to the disabled or elderly. I will definitely try to avoid coming to the airport again which is a shame because the new building area is an improvement on the old. All of my score ratings to your questions reflect a person dropping off friends or relatives.,2,0
bournemouth-airport,D Edmunds,United Kingdom,We paid for parking in advance and struggled to find parking on the day. You cannot get your money back for luggage trolleys taken from inside the terminal building in the car park unless you can find another trolley which has had to be abandoned. Staff are unhelpful and the customer service desk is unmanned both physically and telephonically. We have been struggling to get hold of the airport for 4 days regarding an urgent matter. We had issues the first time we used the airport 2 years ago but decided to try it again. I would rather travel to Southampton or London airports.,2,0
bournemouth-airport,Keith Goodwin,United Kingdom,I agree with everyone about the ridiculous 'Drop off con' but once inside the airport the only restaurant (The Olive Tree) dishes up very poor quality food. Even a McDonalds would be an improvement! I will not be using Bournemouth Airport again until they eventually realise the 'Drop off charge' is a dreadful rip off and stop it and I would only buy a meal in the airport when The Olive tree has been replaced by a 'Garfunkels' or better. The excuse by the airport authorities about the 'Drop off' situation being imposed because of the Glasgow bombings is so pathetic it's laughable!,2,0
bournemouth-airport,Shelagh Clyde,United Kingdom,Bournemouth airport not only charge for drop off but also pick up as well absolutely disgraceful if anyone is visiting our country for the first time what a great impression. No access for pedestrians! Therefore can only assume it is a total rip off. No wonder airlines are avoiding coming to this airport - no doubt the authorities are charging aircraft exorbitant rates as well. When will they learn? The public will avoid this airport like the plague and then everyone will be sorry. Southampton airport here we come.,3,0
bournemouth-airport,S King,United Kingdom,Went to Turkey last August and will be going to turkey this August from Bournemouth. No hanging around at check-in and no hanging around when we returned home. For those who moan about the 2.50 drop off charge pay the extra in fuel and go to Gatwick or Heathrow and wait 2 hours to get through security and on your return wait another 2 hrs to get through security and baggage reclaim parking will cost you a lot more than £2.50. £2.50 is such a small price to pay - very satisfied Bournemouth airport traveller.,9,1
bournemouth-airport,M Cunningham,United Kingdom,"I use this airport on a fairly regular basis as it is just a few miles from home. To avoid the ridiculous ""drop- off"" charge I usually get dropped off at the end of the approach road and walk the last 300 yds. There is no pedestrian access to this airport and you have to walk in the road. Cones have been placed in the middle to prevent cars from turning around as a direct tactic to raise revenue. I find it amazing that a major public amenity has been granted planning permission with no safe access for pedestrians and cyclists. One day someone is going to get run over!",1,0
bournemouth-airport,J O'Newbry,United Kingdom,This is possibly the worst UK airport. They charge for everything to try and recoup the investment they made in new terminals. Pedestrians are pretty well banned and motorists face a charge of £2.50 for a 30 second drop off. Disgraceful is too kind a word! The toilets were disgusting when I visited and staff are disgruntled and aggressive. Avoid Bournemouth at all cost.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,Michael Byatt,,As a regular flier to the south of the UK I often used Bournemouth but that was until they introduced the criminal theft of 2.50 GBP for dropping off or picking up. I now use other airports as a matter of principle. I absolutely refuse to be ripped off by these extortionate charges. I visit the UK around 6 times a year and now I actively boycott Bournemouth.,2,0
bournemouth-airport,James Webb,United Kingdom,All I wanted to do was drop off a friend - I ended up paying £4 for the privilege of doing so! As you enter the airport there are double red lines everywhere so you cannot just stop and let someone out. No room to turn around once you have entered so you have to go through the car park and pay a minimum of £2.50 - up to an hour is £4! The only other routes into the airport that I am aware of are limited - a bus service that runs only once an hour from Bournemouth (£5) or by taxi. I am amazed that they are legally allowed to get away with this. I left Bournemouth Airport feeling like I had been mugged - I doubt I am the only one.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,Peter Allen,United Kingdom,Not only was I incensed by the £2.50 charge when I only wanted to drop passengers off I then tried to pay at the machine only to be told 'ticket already in use' I then had to go into the airport and queue at information! So what was a 30 second drop off ended up being 20 minutes and an extra person wandering around the airport. Absolutely disgusting! I don't care if it's 'local' I will never use Bournemouth airport again.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,S Tomkins,United Kingdom,These charges speak volumes as to the airport's attitude towards it's passengers! Your local caring airport? Its a joke! They really picked a good way to encourage us to support it. Unfortunately this leaves rather a sour taste in the mouth when reviewing the rest of the airports facilities.,5,0
bournemouth-airport,D Morris,United Kingdom,Parking and drop off charges make this an airport of last resort no wonder there are so few flights these days especially in winter. No viable public transport access no pedestrian access make this a disgrace to the town. Try Southampton it's much more customer friendly.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,Ron Taylor,United Kingdom,I agree with all comments about rip off drop off charges. After years off travelling from the friendliest airport I will be making every effort to go somewhere else in the future.,4,0
bournemouth-airport,P Baxter,United Kingdom,The £2.50 drop off charge is not acceptable. I thought they were trying to encourage people to use this airport. This does just the opposite! Don't they get the message all these disgruntled passengers are sending? Maybe they just don't care.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,J Murray,United Kingdom,Drop off and collection charges? This is a shameless extortion to filch every last penny from customers! They only get away with it because there is no alternative you have a captive audience and take advantage. The major airports do not charge neither does Southampton a point not missed by me and my travelling companions.,2,0
bournemouth-airport,Simon Hird,United Kingdom,I have just dropped some friends off at the airport and was disgusted to see the airport wanted to charge me £2.50 to drive through the car park even though I had not got out of the car or even turned off the engine. This is a rip off if I needed to park I would be happy to pay this charge but a 30 second drop off / pick up option is not an unreasonable expectation. We are you customers Bournemouth Airport and this is destroying your reputation.,,0
bournemouth-airport,B Jones,United Kingdom,"I drove a friend from Portsmouth to Bournemouth this morning. I couldn't believe that I had to pay £2.50 just to drop her off at the terminal. This is extortion. When I questioned the guy on the security barrier he said ""you've got 30 minutes so you can buy a coffee"". I said I need to get back to work so only want to drop my friend off. Shocking particularly the bollards placed to try and prevent customers walking the 100yds in. It doesn't work - people were still walking in. I will most certainly never use Bournemouth airport myself - its Gatwick/Heathrow or Southampton for me.",,0
bournemouth-airport,M Chapman,United Kingdom,Bournemouth Airport is following in O'Learys footsteps and charging customers for anything they can think of - £2.50 to drop someone off (taking a few seconds) is about the most unwelcoming thing I've ever encountered in my travels.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,M Jef,United Kingdom,Drop off charge? Madness! It is unfortunate that the airport lost airlines and routes shortly after investing in an airport upgrade but making the airport less attractive to potential customers by introducing such a charge is not the way to boost volumes and recover expenditure. I have recently been using Southampton airport - far more routes now - and no drop off charge!,5,0
bournemouth-airport,Brenda Arnold,United Kingdom,We feel this an excellent airport for local travellers but we are very disappointed to find that when dropping someone off there is a charge of £2.50. We feel you need to look at this as it could make a difference through principal that we choose to fly from Gatwick Airport in the future.,4,1
bournemouth-airport,Jude Cox,United Kingdom,Absurd drop off/pick up parking charges my husband has been down twice within a week to drop off and meet his sister from an Alicante flight and it's cost him £5.00 for a 5 minute favour. Totally disgusting. Southampton doesn't do this why does Bournemouth have to? There's going to be havoc with people walking to entrance to meet their lifts - what will the consequences be then? Crazy!,5,0
bournemouth-airport,P Martin,United Kingdom,I echo others astonishment at the draconian policy of extorting money from all who drop off or collect passengers at the airport. I also pose this thought: the airport has contrary to every usual current policy deliberately made walking along the approach road more dangerous forcing pedestrians onto the road. So when an accident happens and a pedestrian is injured as a result how will the courts respond? Will the airport by virtue of its policy in this matter be liable to pay damages?,1,0
bournemouth-airport,G Thorne,United Kingdom,Glad to see rip of Britain goes from strength to strength. Stop this absurd drop off charge - the main airports don't do it so why do Bournemouth? Bournemouth need to encourage new passengers not drive them away. Whoever decided this has not thought this through.,2,0
bournemouth-airport,Brendan Treacy,United Kingdom,They are forcing people to pay £2.50 just to arrive at an average airport. I got out on the road and walked in - mainly because the taxi driver agreed with me about the whole thing being farcical - they tried to make that impossible as well by blocking all the pedestrian walkways and putting threatening signs everywhere. Pedestrian access should be a right and it should be free.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,T Cooper,United Kingdom,I encountered these charges for the first time when I dropped off my son last week. There is no warning whatsoever until you are within 20 metres of the only entrance into the Passenger Terminal which is at a traffic light controlled crossroad. The approach road from each direction is understandably designated as a no parking zone but once there one has no choice but to turn into the Airport Car Park unless you are prepared to do a 3-point turn in the road - which I will do next time. I took my complaint to the Customer Services Desk and was met with a good deal of weary autotalk about how 'all airports were doing the same every since the Glasgow bombings' - I don't think so. These charges are in my opinion made in the most devious and dishonest manner with passengers and their lifts having no option but to pay for merely being however momentarily on the airport land. If they really want to survive as a meaningful and successful business they should encourage not outrage their customers.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,K Bigwood,United Kingdom,Have just paid £5 to drop-off and pick-up a minor at Bournemouth Airport and have been ripped-off in the process. The £2.50 parking charge is a total disgrace. Clearly the airport authority have to fund a new terminal building but if this is the price of progress then I think Bournemouth airport have just taken a significant step backwards with this parking policy. Will not be using this airport again myself. It only serves to angers the customers whose business you need and damages your reputation in the process.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,G Hendle,United Kingdom,I have used the airport before but have now been forced to pay £5 just to pick up and drop off my grandaughter. Another example of Rip off Britain. I object to being forced to pay an unreasonable charge and will not use Bournemouth airport any more. Forcing people to pay unreasonable charges is not the way to improve a business. No wonder passenger numbers are down. Bournemouth airport should rethink its strategy.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,G Batt,United Kingdom,Use the airport often but tomorrow will be the first time with the drop off charge. Will not be paying the £2.50 charge on either trip but will be stopping in the road opposite the main junction and walking in. Cones sited in this road are not legally placed and can not be enforced. Bournemouth Airport is clearly struggling. An expensive new entrance and facilities and some things have not changed in donkeys years. I use it because it is very convenient. It could be so much better with very little effort.,3,0
bournemouth-airport,M Beenham,United Kingdom,I used to use Bournemouth a lot but now its been turned into a nightmare. Trying to drop someone off is confusing time-consuming and you get charged which is the final insult.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,B Sanderson,United Kingdom,I dropped off my wife and daughter at Bournemouth the first time I have been there since the drop off charges were introduced. What a sight signs bollards security men in yellow jackets. I had no option but to go into the car park to drop them off and on leaving one min later I had to stop and get my ticket validated. There was no clear direction for people being dropped off. The bollards in the road approach road as you turn in are surely illegal forcing anyone who is walking to walk in the road. I am sure this is an accident waiting to happen. Such a shame they have done this. I fly from Bournemouth 2 or 3 times a year and often drop off and pick up but now it doesn't seem such a friendly and 'local' airport.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,J Stonebridge,Spain,Security staff do not seem to have the best attitude we were also charged parking fees after being sent the wrong way to return car hire by a miserable man on outside gate.,3,0
bournemouth-airport,T Collins,United Kingdom,Pleased to see that Rip off Britain is alive & well at Bournemouth airport. What a lovely start to your holiday to have to pay £2.50 for 2 min parking. If other local airports can manage it why can't Bournemouth has it anything to do with a large expensive extension to the airport & airlines reducing their flights? Also no proper pavements for those that decide to walk into the airport.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,Max Greenwell,United Kingdom,Forced to pay £2.50 for 2 minutes as there is no turning back once you turn into the Airport and cones prevent you from escaping. Signs state that you shouldn't leave on foot because it is too dangerous! We saw lots of people avoiding the charge and were being picked up outside. Bournemouth Airport will cause an accident this way.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,N Brown,United Kingdom,I was very disappointed to see that Bournemouth airport have introduced a charge of £2.50 to both drop off and pick up passengers. How short sighted - this will lead to people not using the airport and will leave a very sour taste in the mouth of those who do.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,P Healey,United Kingdom,I visited to drop off for a flight to find that the process has been turned into a money making exercise. Thousands of no waiting cones are positioned each side of the approach road and down the centre of the road funnelling you to the end where there is a barrier preventing further access where you are forced to enter the car park and pay a minimum of £2.50. There is no turning circle. The only place once you have entered the approach road where you could turn around has another security person preventing that. The signs warning that there is no free drop off are only visible once you enter the approach road. There used to be a 10 min free drop off but not anymore.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,B Bakewell,United Kingdom,I work in Europe and did fly from Bournemouth 4 times a month now its £5 to drop off/pick up I now take the train to Southampton.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,R Boyd,United Kingdom,All the negative comments are valid from my viewpoint. I fly up to 10 times per year and Bournemouth had the most over zealous security of any airport. They also have the nerve to state that the plastic liquids bag MUST be a certain size. The UK Govt website states that the size of this bag is recommended not mandatory. With the extra charges for this bag the charges for drop offs and the dismal attitude of the security staff I feel I'm not wanted at this airport any longer. I feel the management there are not trained in true customer service but in how to rip us off.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,H Sherreed,United Kingdom,Flew from Bournemouth to Turkey my first flight from the Airport since the building work has been completed. Pulled up at the car park to a queue of people fiercely complaining about the drop off charge. Noticed lots of people walking from the main road with luggage rather than pay the fixed price to drop. Feel very strongly that this is potentially an accident waiting to happen. On arrival back well this can only be described as a total disaster. I have to say that the new arrival lounge resembled a cattle market and the staff there were completely and utterly useless. How difficult do you think it would be to mix up luggage from arriving flights. Lets face it there are only 2 carousels. People were waiting at the named conveyor watching it go round and round with nobody removing any luggage. It does help if it is put on the right carousel. The staff couldn't help because they were waiting for their boss to sort it. Luggage from 2 different flights was mixed up and the luggage from the Turkey flight was nowhere to be seen. Luggage from the Pisa flight was on both carousels even though they arrived after the Turkey flight. It was not a nice atmosphere to be in as tempers were flaring and the staff hadn't a clue how to solve the problem. The baggage handlers just kept on piling on luggage that nobody was removing and it appeared to be unsafe at times as suitcases were falling off.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,D Taylor,United Kingdom,I used to regard Bournemouth as a lovely airport so easy to use. Not now! I had to take a friend to the airport who walks with a cane just to drop her off for a flight with no baggage. £2.50 for 45 seconds and the same when collecting her! I could see her 10 feet away as she left the arrivals terminal but had to go through the barrier for her to climb in and then pay £2.50 to drive out. In my opinion this is ransom money and nothing short of extortion. Imagine the outcry if they did this at Heathrow or Gatwick.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,Raymond Morton,United Kingdom,"Bournemouth Airport is one of the most user-unfriendly airports I have used a place where passengers appear to be treated as a real inconvenience. Firstly the idea of not having a pavement and trying to restrict pedestrian access to and from the airport is ridiculous. It is then absurd to erect notices saying Pedestrian Access not permitted ""For your safety""! When they have purposely made it unsafe for pedestrians by erecting barriers and not providing a pavement. The abandonment of the free 10 min drop off/pick and the impositon of the £2.50 charge with the accompanying barriered access road and permanent manning of a barrier is prison-like and I would have thought hardly financially beneficial considering the extra manning it must involve. At outbound security passengers are treated like idiots there is no table for passengers to sort their belongings into trays prior to the loaders as at other airports. Being a frequent traveller as many are we know the rules and are quite capable of loading out own trays at a table without the indignity of having to open bags and remove items on the floor in the waiting queue. Finally the new arrivals hall must have been laid out by either a prison warder or a gymnast. It is ironic to see 3 security officers patiently waiting whilst a new arrival of passengers negotiate the long distance chicane hardly wide enough to negiotiate with a trolley/case. Surely the girl at the head of the queue would be better employed opening the barriers so that the first arrivals can go straight to the desks and then opening other parts of a smaller chicane as nessesary. Certainly at other airports (eg Gatwick where passenger numbers are significantly greater) they see no need for a girl to show passengers to an appropriate desk or to have such lengthy chicanes a sign saying ""Wait here until called forward"" suffices. Perhaps your management should visit other airports a benefit from others experience.",2,0
bournemouth-airport,A Charnic,United Kingdom,Avoid this airport's rip off parking - £2.50 drop off / pick up! It feels like it's run by a wheel clamping firm with cones and cameras everywhere. You cannot even walk in as they have made the verges unsafe and there is no proper footpath (what happens in an emergency?). Whoever runs this airport has forgotten the importance of first impressions and they will not notice whatever improvements might be underway if they walk in feeling ripped off on arrival.,2,0
bournemouth-airport,Graham Barber,United Kingdom,What a liberty - the £2.50 drop off and pick up charge. I use this airport 2-3 times a year not any more I would rather have the extra expense and go to Southampton its a nicer airport as well.,2,0
bournemouth-airport,H Mead,United Kingdom,Staggered at the charges at Bournemouth Airport. £2.50 to drop my family off and another £2.50 to pick them up two weeks later. The cheek of it is they have now closed the footpath to the airport and festooned the area up to and including the junction by the main traffic lights with enough cones to make it look like a military action.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,Jamie Davey,United Kingdom,New terminal is very nice but the arrivals building is still the old hospital waiting room. Be warned that parking is an absolute joke. £2.50 for half an hour is criminal. On approach to the airport you are notified of the charges but they have put cones down to avoid people turning around. If you want to leave the airport you have to go into the car park thus paying £2.50. I will not be flying through Bournemouth as the parking charges are stupid. Not worth it.,2,0
bournemouth-airport,Mike Byatt,Spain,A very poor rating since they started ripping off passengers by charging for a drop off. The theft of 2.50GBP just to drop a passenger at the airport is a rip off. They have even employed 'Jobsworths' to operate a barrier so that they can steal from the driver dropping off a passenger.,1,0
bournemouth-airport,Martin Cox,United Kingdom,"Publicity does not make it clear that the ""New Terminal"" just opened does not include any alteration to the dismal arrival buildings which will not be improved until an unspecified date next year. The time taken for baggage to travel a couple of hundred metres from aircraft to baggage hall with only a single flight being handled is very poor. Security appears to have variable comments from passengers. My experience was that the staff were helpful but there were not enough with the queue extending into the check-in area not helped by the passenger ""flow"" from the busiest check-in having to negotiate past all other check-in desks to reach the security area.",3,0
bournemouth-airport,R Lownds,United Kingdom,Being disabled I was pleased with the excellent wheelchair assistance provided the G4S staff - particularly in comparison with that of the indifferent staff this time last year! The new departure facilities are a great improvement on the old but the catering service lets itself down with only the one pay point and a large queue in consequence! Also there's not enough staff on to serve and clear the tables. Yet another case of keeping down the staff costs at the expense of customer inconvenience? Security is improved on our last experience where we had to queue for 40 minutes for the passport check. This time the staff numbers on duty bore the right relationship to the volume of passengers to be checked.,4,0
bournemouth-airport,R Homer,United Kingdom,Complaints about the car parking costs are valid the cost of taxi services to from the airport has been given to the largest local taxi company in the area so others are excluded. The taxis however (Approved local councils authority metered taxi rates) will be a comparable rates you would pay throughout the UK. As far as the infrastructure surrounding Bournemouth airport I wrote to my local MP in Bournemouth about two years ago asking what the plans were to improve the infrastructure to get to from the airport by car. I'm still waitng for a reply although I did get a photo copy of a letter produced by someone at BIA saying they were going to supply a shuttle bus service. Not really the answer I was looking for. The whole Bournemouth airport experience has always been one of make do and don't mend and I don't think anything will ever change..,2,0
bournemouth-airport,Andy Jones,,New terminal is under construction so you can expect a little walking through a building site at times but they are managing very well. A major gripe - the officious G4S Security Supervisor who checks the size of passengers re-sealable liquid bags before you get into security. He told my Wife that the bag she had her make-up in was too large and directed her to a machine that sold plastic bags for an incredible £1. The bag that she was using was given to her by Security Staff at Gatwick only three weeks before but was not acceptable at Bournemouth. He produced a hand written felt tip pen sign with some dimensions on and said that it was his decision as too what size was accepted. We can only assume that the machine was owned by this man.,3,0
bournemouth-airport,Rob Belcher,,Apart from the car parking costs Bournemouth is a great airport. No rows and rows of shops trying to rip you off a 10min walk from the car park and a 5 min walk to the plane. If you want to have a meal and do some shopping before the flight forget it but if you want to have a stress free time at the airport its perfect. Just hope the improvements dont spoil it.,4,0
bournemouth-airport,S Omar,,"Car parking at Bournemouth International Airport has now gone up to fifty-two pounds a week so it's lucky that locals in Ringwood are offering airport users the chance to park in their drives as part of the park at my house scheme. At the moment the Arrivals Hall is just a waiting room with no magazines and a vending machine and a single screen showing the arrivals but it's all full of ""rustic charm"" as they say and the really positive thing is that as soon as a plane has landed the passengers without luggage are straight out and ready for home. All in all I think it's a great airport very low key and relaxed and friendly.",4,0
bournemouth-airport,Susan Omar,,Yes there is now a link bus it stops at the taxi rank outside the Arrivals at Bournemouth Airport and it goes to Bournemouth town centre every 30 minutes during the day. It calls itself a shuttle but it isn't free. You're right - the airport isn't on the main route to anywhere being in the village of Hurn as it is. I give people a lift to the airport when they park at my house in Ringwood because the taxis are about twenty pounds and there is not a bus!,3,0
bournemouth-airport,A Turnell,,I was fortunate enough to be given a lift back to the airport for my late flight last night although next week that won't happen and I'll have to find my own way from the train station to the airport as the bus service finishes at 19:00. Taxi fares are quoted at £14 which is more expensive than my flight! Can anyone with local knowledge suggest a means of public transport to get from station to airport? I've found a bus that takes me closish (Parley Cross) but this will still involve a 2.5 mile walk! It looks like transport links are an issue for the airport - perhaps there aren't enough evening flights to warrant a bus service? The airport itself is obviously undergoing a major redevelopment at the moment and I'm sure it will be fantastic once completed.. I can imagine that the departure lounge can get crammed during busy times but it was fine last night. I did witness a minor flare-up between despatch staff and crew from another Ryanair plane that had been sat on stand for a while so maybe the comment about the inability of the airport to cope with more than two planes is true! Security staff were fine and facilities just about adequate. Can't imagine what it must be like in the summer season!,3,0

bournemouth-airport,L Addis,,Passed through Bournemouth on way from Dublin to Edinburgh. I couldn't quite conceive how small it was but I see construction is well on the way. However the longer I stayed there the more fond I became. There is no-one really about it is quiet. Security I see has been mentioned before and the problem may have been rectified as I had two elderly men steer me through who seemed very friendly and chatty. The duty-free shop is truly hilarious like a police seized goods room of shelves. Very happy to see (if old and tatty) comfy seats with no armrests. I took much pleasure in spreading out for a kip and to read my books. Glasgow flight went Edinburgh one touched down a tad late. Friendly and personal Servisair ladies were refreshing and our plane departed with only 22 people on board.,3,0
brasilia-airport,Rob Brook,United Kingdom,Arrival from Lisbon - long queues for non-Brazilian passport holders at Immigration and then again at Customs after baggage pick-up. Only one person checking everyone from an A340 plane (it took over an hour) so decided not to line up but sit down and wait it out. At least there is a small shop to relieve the tedium. Bring a good book. Plenty of taxis outside to take you into the city. Mine was metered so the fare was as expected. Departure on an internal flight to Sao Paulo. Check in was rapid and lines at security not too bad. But eat outside in the pleasant concourse before you go through security. There is only one small snack stand (that we could find) on airside and the seating area waiting for the transfer bus is small and crowded. No wi-fi either. Essentially many parts of the airport seem not to have expanded with increased traffic. How this airport will cope with the crowds attending World Cup 2014 can only be imagined.,3,0
brasilia-airport,S Koenig,Brazil,As noted the check-in area is open air and spacious. The shopping area beyond that was expansive. All in all nice. The gate area used by most domestic flights however would be more suited for a small provincial airport with few flights. There is not nearly enough room for the lines of people waiting to board. Thel snake thrugh the small terminal making it difficult for others to walk by. My fight was not through a jetway but via a shuttle bus. The monitor above the door we were to use first correctly reflected our flight and time and then suddenly switched to another flight leaving from another gate (there had been no gate change). Brazilians commented that a tourist (e.g. for the World Cup in 2014) would be completely lost. The bus trip to the plane was very long. For arrivals the directions on where to go for the baggage claim area (vs. connecting flights) were confusing. The bagage claim area is rather big confusing and dirty. It took over half an hour to get my bags. Signage to taxis busses etc. is inadequate. Still all in all I'd rate BSB above many other Brazilaian airports. It's easier to use than Rio or Sao Paulo at least until you get to the cramped gate area.,6,1
brasilia-airport,G Castro,,Brasilia airport is probably the best Brazilian airport. The shopping/eating area is good and with a great variety. The information desk is good and people friendly not to mention the architecture that is beautiful. The bad things about the airport are Transportation - Buses not as frequent as they should be. No metro or train. Boarding area - once you pass Security the airport is too crowded and not having the same amenities as the pre-boarding area make the journey less comfortable. Too small for the traffic it has. Drop off/Pick Up passengers: There is a lack of enforcing the laws and people park in the drop off areas making it difficult to approach sometimes.,4,0
brasilia-airport,Andre Souza,,BSB has its modern part but it is still a quite bad airport seems that they don't care about changing anything on this airport it's busy on weekends. Staff can be quite rude and as in most of Brazilian airports everything is overpriced. You'd be better eat somewhere else before flying.,3,0
brasilia-airport,G Villela,,The apparent discrepancy in previous comments is easily explained. The BSB terminal's quality is strikingly different between the boarding gate area and the pre-security one. The latter is really nice. The city's high-altitude tropical climate makes for amenable temperatures almost all year around and makes air conditioning dispensable in the wide open entrance area which is a really pleasant place. Check-in is usually fast and efficient (except on late Thursday and on Friday because of the already mentioned busy traffic of Congressmen and their aides going to home states) there is a fairly complete shopping-mall-style food court with many options including movie theatres good shopping with not only the usual luxury-item style but also plenty of those last-minute simple essentials. Once past security however things change. It wouldn't be bad were it not for the fact that the boarding gate area was simply underdimensioned for the traffic it gets. Pray to get a jet-bridged gate because the ground- level boarding area for bussed remote positions is very small and can be really chaotic at times. Arrivals are usually fine though - enough conveyor belts and luggage arrives fast enough to ensure a quick turnover. Signage could be better on arrival and transit areas. Transportation is indeed a problem - the buses mentioned are regular urban buses with no space for luggage and are infrequent. Taxis are really expensive but are mostly the only practical choice. But a light-rail line is planned for the next couple of years and that should improve things a lot.,3,0
brasilia-airport,S Koenig,,"I transited changing planes on my way from Fortaleza to Rio so can speak of only one part of the airport. That part was old-looking (maybe 70s retro-style) and cramped. The circular donut-shaped design with one wall between the central area and the boarding gates limited space so that if you had to walk between gates you needed to cut through lines of people waiting for every flights. The fact that this was a Friday afternoon when parliamentarians may have been fleeing Brasilia to return to their home towns may have exacerbated the situation. To me it looked like an older smaller airport in the midwestern U.S. that could call itself international due to one or two flights a day to Canada. Just one area in which to buy food (mainly snacks) with a long line. The rest of the airport including check-in area may be nice but my reaction to the gate area was What a dump.""",2,0
brasilia-airport,F Costa,,Considering the standard for Brazilian Airports the Capital's is very modern. Good options for shopping and eating and even some cinema theaters. As it is one of the hubs of the country the traffic in intense most of the time. There is a lack of good transportation options for the city. There is no subway station the buses are rare and uncomfortable and the taxis are quite expensive.,4,0

bratislava-airport,Farouk Mogheth,,Quite an embarrassing airport for a capital city of a booming country! I realise that VIE is quite near and the Slovaks completly lost interest in having a viable international airport of their own but the current state is less than satisfactory. The airport is stuck in a time warp passenger numbers are rising however there are no real facilities for the passenger and none for a business traveller. Shopping is a joke and nothing really to talk about. Check in in summer charter increase is assisted by a tent - staff surly and unable to assist. Spare yourself the hassle and fly to Vienna and they offer bus shuttles to Bratislava city as well - a far more civilised manner to fly.,1,0
bratislava-airport,Richard Melisek,,"As an employee at Bratislava Airport I have a few objections to L.Suciaghi's comments. First of all announcements about departures are made in both Slovak and English with the exception of Slovak charter flights which are often (but not always) announced only in Slovak as the passengers are Slovak and perhaps Czech nationals. On the other hand arrival announcements are only in Slovak as there are quite a few monitors/screens which are directly linked to the system here at OPC and hence automatically display current information. The arrival announcements are made in Slovak as they are not aimed at the passengers (they have the monitors) but at different workers at the airport i.e. mechanics catering bus drivers as we bus passengers to/from the A/C with some minor exceptions baggage handlers etc). Announcements in the gate are made if the airline wants them and these are made at least in Slovak and English. I would also like to state that often we make announcements also in other languages ie. for the twice weekly SU flight to SVO also in Russian and sometimes in Hungarian Italian German French but that only if unnecessary and very seldom. We also have three announcements plus special ""name"" announcements - quite a few more than at many other airports.",,0
bratislava-airport,Lorant Suciaghi,,Efficient small airport still has that east block feel to it still. Check in was fast and efficent but the agent looked like she was about to lose the plot with the face she had on her.

bratislava-airport,R Sherman,,"BTS Airport is small for an international airport but it is easy in and easy out. Seating is limited but because it is small you don't have to be there for hours on end (unless your flight gets delayed). Luggage trolleys require a coin (US$0.25 5SK or 2 Euro) but you get the coin back when you return the trolley. Parking is expensive for this small airport (550SK) but in the ""off-airport"" parking lot it is half the price. There are plenty of places to get a snack in the airport and the duty-free shopping is adequate. The airport would do well to have a shop that carried some Slovak souveniers as none are really available there now. There is regular bus service from the airport to Vienna which takes about 75 minutes. All in all a decent but small international airport.",3,0
bratislava-airport,Nigel Lillywhite,,I do not think BTS is up to international standards. Arrivals are probably adequate as most passengers want to get away quickly. The departure check in area is small and there are only 6 or 8 seats available for waiting passengers who do not want to pay to sit in a small cafe or the restaurant. The latter is upstairs no lift or escalator is apparent. Those with luggage with children or with physical limitations are disadvantaged. The B departure gate lounges are ludicrously small and 3/4 of passengers on a major flight will have to stand for up to 3/4 hour before boarding. on 21st April 2007 a situation arose in which it was very fortunate that no accident or panic occurred at the bottom of the escalator to the shuttle bus for a late flight.,,0
bratislava-airport,Janne Petersson,,Last time I used BTS check-in took less than a minute and most of the staff are nice and helpful. However be careful if you fly with CSA or Lufthansa from BTS and have connections at PRG or MUC: If you want to buy Slovak liquor note that not all duty-free shops provide the sealable plastic bags needed to get the bottles through security at PRG or MUC. I had to leave my bottles go to one of the other shops and ask them for a sealable bag take it to the liquor shop myself and ask the staff there to pack my bottles in that bag. Unacceptable. Otherwise BTS is a nice airport.,,0
bratislava-airport,Cormac Phelan,,Very clean and accesible by the excellent bus service. Howeverit is somewhat restricted in terms of open space. The check-in area is quite small and was quite crowded due to the Ryanair flights to Stansted and Dublin all being processed simultaneously. Overcrowding appears again once you have gone through security. The boarding gate the Dublin flight was leaving from had a sliding door separating it from the main hall- area and as there was a flight to Tunisia using this gate all the Dublin passengers were forced to crowd outside the door (where there was a lack of seating).Nice airport overall but could do with an expansion.,,0
bratislava-airport,Mike Preston,,I flew out of this airport on Sky Europe this morning and was favourably impressed with the cleanliness speed and efficiency of check in and departure also with the friendly attitude of the check in agent and the restaurant staff. A very pleasant airport indeed and a refreshing change. I will certainly consider using this route for any future trips to Vienna despite the 60kms which distance it from that town. The taxi fare to/from the city centre should be less than SKK 300 (GBP 6) and the ride is about 20 minutes. Unfortunately not all taxi drivers are honest the scumbag who took us from the railway station into town (5 minutes) on arrival charged SKK 400 by somehow fiddling the meter. On the negative side the duty free prices (EU) are high but I suppose that is beyond their control as now that Slovakia has joined the EU it no longer has the right to decide on such matters as tax rates.,,0
bratislava-airport,Holger Thiele,,"In general BTS is easy to navigate but bssed on my recent visit there I would point out two things. Bus #61 going downtown and to the railway station has two stops near the airport: To the left of the terminal is the bus terminus; across the street from Arrivals is the first bus stop when going downtown. Bus tickets strictly cannot be purchased on board ! If a ticket vending machine is broken down (as in my case) one has to find another source for buying a ticket (a kiosk or go to the next bus stop). I was unable to find a kiosk selling bus tickets at the airport (but not all kiosks were open - so there might be one). To make things more complicated the ticket vending machines accept only coins (bring a lot of coins to purchase a daypass !). If more than one flight is leaving at the same time waiting times at outbound immigration and subsequent security check can be long. This is worsened by the fact that staff at BTS tends to page ""Last calls for flight xxx"" pretty early but once at the departure gate boarding hasn't started yet (but don't count on that).",,0
bratislava-airport,Marián Ondrišík,,"Bratislava Airport most traffic is operated by low-cost airlines. These don't have any connection flights (low cost carriers do not offer transit flights and only some of them offer transfer flights) and one of their rules is that the check-in opens two hours before the scheduled time of departure. Therefore a passenger cannot expect to check-in her/his luggage seven hours prior departure. Condition of the particular airline of this kind should be written at least on website. But in local conditions this is how it works also for passengers of global airlines alliance members Air France Austrian Airlines Czech Airlines Delta Airlines Lufthansa or Spanair codesharing on flights from Bratislava. One of the reasons is also baggage sorting area limits. There is no additional space for luggage waiting to be loaded in seven hours what can cause a loading mistake so the baggage can be loaded incorrectly and ""be lost"". However baggage sorting area is now under reconstruction (as well as baggage screening system whole check-in area ticketing area or arrival area) and its space should be doubled at least. Bratislava Airport is improving its services according the EU and SR legislation and regulations as it can. To compare annual capacity of the terminal build in late 60s and early 70s and enlarged in mid-90s is 350000 passengers a year. This year BTS expects approximately 1250000 passengers. Left luggage office was closed under new management regulations because of security reasons (no satisfactory baggage screener) in mid-2004. Under this decision it will be according the airport spokesperson closed until a new terminal with relevant security facilities in 2007 will be build. Regarding this interesting is that Main Railway Station as well as Main Bus Station have no satisfactory baggage screeners in their left luggage offices and these offices are opened. By the end of 2005 a name of new investor and future 66% shares owner of Airport Bratislava (BTS) should be announced. Hopefully inverstors main intention will be solving the problems of terminal congestion lack of staff and quality of services.",,0
bratislava-airport,L Bleichenbacher,,Last week I used BTS airport arriving from Kosice around 9am and with a connection to Zurich at 5pm. Having planned to spend the day exploring Slovakia's beautiful capital I was rather intrigued to find out that the left luggage office 'had been closed for security reasons'. A friendly employee suggested that I could leave my luggage at the train station (a 20' taxi ride and at some distance from the city centre) which I first took to be a joke. When I then tried to check into my SkyEurope flight a mere seven hours before take-off the attendant said this was impossible because 'in the meantime the luggage might get lost'. For me the outcome of this extremely customer-unfriendly and rather absurd policy was to hit the central bus station (which is only somewhat closer to the centre than the railway station but still a 15' taxi ride if there is no traffic congestion) whereby I lost over an hour of precious Bratislava-time. Conclusion: Transit passengers are something Bratislava Airport may yet improve services for.,,0
bratislava-airport,Robin Noble,,Bratislava airport is pretty small but efficient - think Birmingham UK then divide it by four and you have the approximate size.

bratislava-airport,Peter Kacur,,During peak times especially in the summer usually all 11 check-in desks are open. However the terminal should undergo a slight reconstruction in the winter season which should bring some more check-in desks as well as passport check counters. From January 2005 the airport will have its own security service so the checks will be more flexible and brisk. The so far state airport shall be privatized within a year and then a construction of a new passengers terminal is expected.,,0
bratislava-airport,Dave Jaros,,BTS airport has been revitalised a bit due to increasing traffic by domestic low-cost company (SkyEurope) however its out of limits especially in space for check-in - in peak times there are only two counters open. Accessible by bus No 61 from train station but drivers are sometimes angry and buses not suitable for easy baggage transport. Tickets are sold in machines or news-stands only (no driver sale !!!) so look around for coins. Terminal - absolute lack of seats inside and not visible security precautions. Most vulnerable point that can make you upset is security check - just after passport control you stay in line mixed from few streams and only one from two x-ray gates is open goes very slowly every stuck stops the people behind (executed by state policemen not security service - they don't pull people aside when beeping but stop them all until trouble solved !). A bit late gate/delay display information no arm access to planes (so that all 100 passengers must walk outside or are taken by bus). Baggage unload is quite fast yet. Recommended like low cost alternative to Vienna (60 km) good train (city) or shuttle bus connection.,,0

bratislava-airport,R Lester,,I visited Bratislava airport in March 2003 the airport itself was very clean small and user friendly. The airport only handles a handful of flights a day and the staff that check you in also take you to your plane.

This airport certainly has potential to handle more flights that it does at present.,,0
bremen-airport,Andrew Coogans,United Kingdom,"Flew in and out of the dedicated Ryanair terminal (Terminal E) at Bremen Airport, but also spent some time in the other main terminal complex. Upon arrival, the Immigration desks were efficient, but the queuing area seemed to be slightly small for a full Boeing 737-800, and indeed there was a small area outside to accommodate a queue. The terminal seems to be a converted hangar, and serves its purpose well. Baggage collection time was fine. Amazingly close tram stop outside, along with office blocks and hotels. It feels like the airport is simply another building in the middle of the city. The tram is a very convenient and cheap way into the city centre. On departure, we walked through the main terminal to get to Terminal E. It appeared very spacious and quiet. There appeared to be adequate check in desks for the flights that were operating and the whole place seemed very tranquil. Terminal E itself was busy. About a 10 minute wait at Security and then the gate area seemed very crowded, particularly for the non-Schengen area flights, of which there were 2 departing within 5 minutes of each other. Still, I was impressed with this airport and would have no issues about using it again.",8,1

I flew there last year on Easyjet to and from London Luton but they don't do the route anymore it seems. Squeezed out by the inferior product from Ireland I guess so the comment about other low- cost competition may be a pipe dream. Now if Easyjet were to try again from Gatwick they may give Ryanair a fright. My advice to Jurgen when next departing this lovely airport is to use the facilities in the main terminal first (much nicer and not much blue!) before travelling to Ryanair's plastic chairs at the last possible minute.,3,0
bremen-airport,Jurgen Arnold,,As living in the north of The Netherlands Bremen airport is a good alternative for Amsterdam. Recently flown from the new low cost Ryanair terminal. Its basic clean and blue! There is a multipurpose shop which sells everything from a to z at somewhat inflated prices and small coffee shop. Seating is mostly in plastic chairs which you could find at your local dentist. Reasonable but we had an early flight so it was not so crowded. Would not like to be there when its get full. There are also some paid internet terminals. The airport is well situated from the city center and freeway from the parking garage you are within 3 minutes in the main terminal building. Bremen is still a great small airport but they need to get some other low cost airlines on board besides Ryanair.,4,0

Tram number 6 will take you to the main square outside the central railway station in 10 minutes for 2.05 Euros. Tickets are purchased not from the driver but from onboard ticket machines that take coins only. There are instructions in English. Airport has a very small duty free shop and in the evenings (our flight was at 21.20) the departure lounge only has vending machines for the purchase of hot and cold drinks ice crams and snacks. Overall a stress and hassle-free airport.,,0
bremen-airport,Hassan Al Jebel,,"Bremen is a quite modern airport small but the first impression is really good. I arrived by taxi but the taxi driver left me in front of Terminal 1. At that time of the day the airport was empty no rush so was the service. The signs to find the LH counters - no idea where they are! I saw an information desk where a woman in red dress was sitting. She was very unfriendly when I asked where I can find LH. She said ""Terminal 3"" and nothing else. I don't think this is a service desk just a cashier for the parking - and service means friendliness to me. LH check in was really good friendly efficient and professional like I had experienced before at other airports. I arrived more than 2 hours prior to departure so I had plenty of time. Some nice cafes at the second level some bistros a restaurant and travel agencies. Some pictures are presented in a room in terminal 3. Shopping is very poor although there are some signs showing the way. Didn't find any. Hair dresser was closed in the morning. No chance to change my left Euros. Excellent a free of charge terrace at level 3 with a great view of the apron. ""Bremenhalle"" on the roof is a small museum with an old airplane called Bremen like the city which first crossed the Atlantic from East to West real aviation history is presented here. Security check was somehow rude. Boarding on time and efficient. All in all a very nice small airport nice terrace but only a really small number of shops missing/wrong sings dirty toilets (waters is dirty). Airport could be even much better. I will come back to Bremen.",,0
bremen-airport,M Meiners,,"I just had to fly out from BRE. Actually a nice small airport bright and quiet with lots of green in front of it located just a few kms away from downtown Bremen with easy and frequent connections by tram leaving in front of central station and dropping passengers of right in front of the terminal within 20 minutes. Layout of the terminal is a bit strange: arrivals in the center with departure and check-in sections on either sides. I took the first entrance showing ""Departure"" and of course couldn't see any LH desks when looking on the monitors I found out I had to go to terminal three. That gives the feeling that the whole airport is huge but actually this ""T3"" is across the arrival hall just at the other end of the building all on the same floor at a short walk away. LH ticketing lady friendly and helpful. Check in at LH easy and quick. Only one eco one business and even first class check in desk (even though on domestic an European flights LH doesn't offer First class). Attendants just wave waiting passengers to come trough at the first desk available. Lady at first class desk efficient and doing her job but not much more than that... If I were a First class passenger I would at least have expected a smile for the price I'd have to pay... For the rest not much to do in the terminal building. There is a sign indicating ""shopping"" on the 2nd floor but there is a just a pharmacy and a small ""art"" exposition (which was actually certainly not of my taste). Throughout the building there a few news stands/ souvenir shops and a variety of coffee shops some looking actually nice and friendly. Offering a variety of drinks and snacks for very reasonable prices (I would almost say cheap compared to the rip off prices in other airports). For the rest loads of last minute ticket shops selling last minute holidays to the well known tourist spots in Europe and around the world. Maybe convenient for locals who want to have a easy overview of all the offers but for those who already have their tickets to leave not of much distraction. For the rest not a soul there. Security a bit overdue in my eyes: I handed over my cell phone wallet with coins and was asked to remove my belt (I still wait for the first time all passengers will have to strip down...) but still the buzzer went of because of my watch or so and that happened to basically everyone passing. In the departure lounge LH offers free coffee and tea and some news papers (only in German including international titles like Financial Times so not much for international travelers...). Altogether a quick and pleasant experience.",,0
bremen-airport,J Boese,,Bremen is one of the cute little airports that make flying fun. Located close to the city you can leave home/hotel about an hour before your flight departs and you will make it. Security is usually very friendly (rare for German airports). Since it is not too busy departures are quick long taxiways unheard of and upon returning in most cases I found my bags already rotating on the belt when I came from the plane. The tram connection to the city center could be more frequent evenings and Sundays but then a cab is just a few bucks anyway.,,0
brescia-airport,Dave Stanley,United Kingdom,This is a fairly small but modern airport that is taking a lot of charter flights for winter sports holidays. Often small airports give very good service compared to the large well known international airports. Brescia does not. On our arrival the queue for immigration extended outside the building almost as far as the aircraft we had arrived in. Luckily the weather was kind to us. Baggage reclaim was somewhat chaotic. On the way out we were delayed by 5 hours. The airport has minimal facilities and we were provided with a fairly awful sandwich and had to wait in the crowded entrance hall. Check-in queues were long. Airside there were next to no services and not enough space. Overall a very poor experience.,2,0
brindisi-airport,Lawrie Hall,,Brindisi (Salento) is a pleasant fairly new airport spacious enough for the level of fights. The lurid yellow/green fluorescent plastic seats are a bit much and I wouldn't want to encounter them with a hangover. Transit from city centre by bus 'A' costs 80cents (buy tickets in airport or in town from the bar on the way from the railway station to the bus stop in Via C Colombo) and runs half hourly. The snack bar prices are silly. Coffee 60% more than in town bottled beer 150% more (draught beer only 25% more but wasn't available). If your flight is from gate 1 (which the Ryanair flight to STN was) be aware that it is straight in front of passport control meaning that a lot of people can't get through passport control until boarding begins.,4,0
brisbane-airport,Carlo Irace,Australia,I was coming back from a holiday in Italy on July 8th with my family and after almost two days of travelling we were directed by airport staff to a line reserved for family with children and I was glad to see that they finally did something to make life for parents and kids easier especially after a long flight. However I was wrong to think that because the line we were in was the longest and most painful I experienced with just one officer checking passports keeping us waiting for more than 1 hour. The worse part was that our line (family line with children) was queuing and it was extremely slow while there was hardly any queues in the rest of the lines for passengers with no children. My frustration was unbearable especially when you are surrounded by children crying and screaming. ,4,0
brisbane-airport,G Bray,Australia,This is my first visit to the international terminal since the renovations took place. The tilted hall looks a little cold and harsh at the moment but then again the newly planted trees have not grown and will probably soften that effect soon enough. Having a small food court at one end and three bars and coffee shops in the other areas gives an impression of a luxury end and poor end to the hall. Have not had the bad experience through immigration or customs that others complain about. The far flung gates can feel very distant and empty with few services bar those that exist in the central hall.,7,1
brisbane-airport,A Dunn,Australia,I've been through approximately 20 different international airports and don't understand why everyone is giving Brisbane such a bad rap. After reading through a few reviews I don't believe anybody has really experienced anything that could warrant such low ratings. Is the airport easy to get to? Yes. Do I feel safe in this airport? Yes there's no need for soldiers to be stationed there or paramilitary with automatic weapons at every vantage point. Is it easy to navigate? It's small and fairly open so yes. Are the staff culturally sensitive and ethical? In my experience yes you're not going be searched here because you haven't covered your tattoos or have to worry about security staff confiscating your items so they can pocket it. And neither are you going to be separated into different queues based on your gender. Are the queues that long? There's definitely room for improvement but in no way is it anywhere near the worst I've experienced elsewhere. Clean? Every time I've been through it's clean.,8,1
brisbane-airport,D Lobo,Australia,Shocking customs and immigration queues. They know how many international airlines are arriving at the same time so why don't they add more staff. Trying to be an international destination with regional staffing!,2,0
brisbane-airport,N Atwe,Australia,When we arrived from Europe stopping through Incheon International Airport you can see the difference in all levels. We commented that after stopping from Incheon Brisbane Airport belongs to the dinosaur era.,3,0
brisbane-airport,R Cooper,Australia,In the last few years this airport has gone from being reasonably acceptable to being a total joke particularly since the recent renovations. Making both arriving and departing passengers pass through the duty free stores thereby running the gauntlet of aggressive sales staff is totally unacceptable an insult to the travelling public and something of which Brisbane Airport Corporation should be ashamed. While I pass through the terminal at least twice a month and used to spend time perusing the shops while outbound I now refuse to spend a cent in the shops on principle. On top of that mornings at the airport (both arriving and departing) are an absolute debacle with long queues and insufficient customs staff and the most inefficient security staff (outbound) I have ever encountered. If the body scanners are in use it seems that the whole screening process for the rest of the passengers comes to a halt. To further inconvenience the travelling public the scanning machine operators change frequently and instead of adopting a system whereby there is a short overlap between operators they have to stop the whole system for about five minutes further backing up the queue. Finally when inbound and holding an express card one would think the process would be efficient right? No. Following the signs to the express queue at immigration results in the longest possible walk to the counters and then you simply merge with the normal queue! Who dreams up these systems? My recommendation is to avoid this airport wherever possible. Unfortunately for those who live in Brisbane there is little alternative but at least don't encourage their poor management lack of planning and foresight and the derision with which they treat passengers by spending money at the overpriced duty free stores or extortionate foreign exchange facilities.,2,0
brisbane-airport,J Miller,Australia,Its very sad to see that an essential service to the public like an airport should be has become more a shopping center than an airport. People are now forced to go though duty free shopping both in and out of the International terminal. And the shelves with products are placed in the middle of the corridors so people have to actually stop and go around them making it impossible to walk straight through. It is very sad how society has become! What next? Force people through shopping stores as you walk into emergency section of hospitals? Police stations? Should all of society be focused only towards selling products?,1,0
brisbane-airport,P Schweizer,Australia,"Just returned from LAX on Monday 06/10/14 on QF 16. Seems the international arrival area is going through extensive renovation to ensure each arriving passenger has to pass through duty free upon arrival. Upon arrival on Monday I could not believe my eyes when we actually had to stand in line in front of the duty free area for approx. 30 minutes before being able to enter the actual immigration area. Fortunately I had an express card and eventually made it to the baggage claim within 1 hour but believe economy passengers would have easily spent 2-3 hours clearing immigration. Air conditioning was not sufficient and saw lots of tired families arriving with their children after a long trip from Europe/Asia/America. Immigration experience simple and fast as usual but the incompetence did not stop there. Had the pleasure of waiting another 30 minutes for my luggage as some clever mind decided to combine our QF flight from LA (B 747) and a SQ flight from Singapore (A 330) and the same luggage belt. As the majority of passengers were stuck in the immigration line no luggage was removed from the belt so lots of luggage was backed-up and could not get on to the belt. Needless to say that 2 other belts were not used at all while others just serviced single flights on small B 737 aircraft. First impression of a visitor arriving in a foreign country is always the airport so I feel very sorry that so many visitors on that day had such terrible experience arriving in Brisbane. Hope somebody will take responsibly to this mess but assume on my next return home to Brisbane I will ""enjoy"" a walk through a new shopping mall.",,0
brisbane-airport,Bronwyn Hughes,Australia,Brisbane airport - Cairns has a smoking section once you are passed security. Having passed through the lines at security the last thing I want to do is go outside. Also flying out on a 10pm I was hoping to get a meal. I arrived before 9 to find everything substantial closed. Fair enough but the terminal was packed with still 4 flights to go out. I was a little disappointed. Plus side the airtrain and access to the terminal is great.,5,0
brisbane-airport,A Cai,Australia,Good Aussie airport. Designs - much newer with fresh attractive colors. Gets the basics right too.,9,1
brisbane-airport,Lucas Walmsley,Australia,Brisbane Airport is an absolute abomination. It is without doubt the worst first-world airport I have ever had the misfortune to experience. The staff are acceptable however the facilities are a disgrace. Toilets are filthy and food outlets non-existent. There are only 4 food outlets in the entire place 3 of which are coffee shops all selling the same overpriced items. The line for food is over 30min! It's currently undergoing renovations but still not acceptable and a poor example of what Australia has to offer.,,0
brisbane-airport,Glen Lawrence,Australia,I live in Brisbane so need to use this airport when travelling overseas which I have done consistently for the past 12 years. I have to say that unfortunately I find Brisbane International Airport to be the worst in the world compared with those I have used. I have flown in and out of at least 20 international airports around the world including New York (JFK and Newark) London (Heathrow and Gatwick) Los Angeles Singapore Bangkok Hong Kong Abu Dhabi and Chicago. Brisbane airport is incredibly inefficient the staff are consistently rude and unhelpful and I am embarrassed that this is the first impression of Brisbane and Australia for many tourists. The toilets are in an unacceptable condition the facilities non existent. Passport control is very slow I arrived last night at 1am still took 1 hour to get to the taxi rank from landing and we were the only plane there. In comparison we arrived at 18.40 from Hong Kong we were checked into the room of our hotel by 19.20. I have been hearing for years at this current location and the previous ones that there is 'going to be renovation'. Well if there has been they have not been successful at all. Perhaps some of the decision makers at Brisbane airport could spend some time at Airports that actually look after their passengers and citizens such as Heathrow and Singapore. Hopefully over the next few years it will improve.,,0
brisbane-airport,K Pardoe,Australia,Arrived early morning (0700) and straight into chaos at the immigration. Huge queues for all 3 passport lanes. Immigration officer attempted to apologise by saying that a few flights had arrived at the same time like they were not expecting anybody! After that it was quick through customs. One bag had arrived when we arrived at the baggage carousel but still had to wait for the other one. Sydney is a far better choice than Brisbane.,4,0
brisbane-airport,I Favella,United Kingdom,Good clean and well set out. It is a lot better in the international terminal and a lot quieter.,9,1
brisbane-airport,D Walker,Australia,Flown out through Brisbane International recently. Immigration and screening areas way to small for the amount of mid morning flights. 3 eating areas which is poor. Tiny TV screens to check your departure gate info. Refurb going on which is a waste of money. Nothing much else there.,3,1
brisbane-airport,M Everett,Australia,Least helpful immigration staff I have ever come across. Was traveling LAX-PER via BNE with my wife (non Australian) with 2 hours to clear customs and get to the domestic terminal. I cleared the e-chip queue in about 5 minutes however my wife lined up in the foreign nationals queue. 3 staff working with a massive queue at 7.45am. It was evident that the pace travellers were being processed would not enable us to make the connecting flight and I requested two separate immigration staff assist my wife to clear immigration. Both were most unhelpful and said they couldn't assist as if they gave her preferential treatment they would have to give it to others who may miss their flights. I would presume part of their customer service role would be to assist travellers in need of such assistance. I waited another 30 minutes for my wife and missed the connecting flight. Just what I needed after spending 23 hours in transit. The Qantas check in officer was most helpful and said it was a fairly common occurrence due to immigration protocols (read incompetence). Next flight to Perth was full so had to fly home via Sydney with an additional 4 hours added to my transit time. Ridiculous and disgraceful. Will avoid this airport at all costs in the future.,,0
brisbane-airport,Helmut Schneider,Australia,The staff at Brisbane Airport are very rude that includes security and passport control staff. However when looking closer a lot of people stand around just doing nothing. There are very long queues waiting for security checks even if you have a so called express card. The whole situation would need a real good look at to streamline the procedure and motivate the staff to be a bit more customer friendly. I personally have never seen anything like it anywhere else. For the time being I will stay away from Brisbane International Airport.,1,0
brisbane-airport,Susan Smith,United Arab Emirates,I found the staff to be rude particularly at passport control. Travelling a lot through numerous airports around the world Brisbane is one of the worst for courtesy to the traveller. Having just recovered from cancer I found it extremely distressing to be put through the new scanner which failed to work first time and had to be reset I had to stand around and wait for the machine to reset for them to put me in it again. A distressing unnecessary start to my long journey.,4,0
brisbane-airport,T Maddern,Australia,I have flown in and out of Brisbane International and Domestic terminals several times over the past year. I have found both terminals clean and easy to get around. I also like them because there are plenty of seats and places where you can look out and watch planes and what's going on outside. In both terminals security is fine and not too intrusive queue times for me also were not an issue. For those wanting food and drink there are plenty of places in the terminals to get these outlets in the international terminals as expected are overpriced. There is a train link to get to the city this takes about 10-20 mins apparently and also links with the Gold Coast. There is a taxi rank outside the terminals also. Beware - Hiring a trolley for your bags is a rip off at $4.00 at the domestic terminal.,8,1
brisbane-airport,J Cole,Australia,Brisbane International airport is one of the least efficient in the world I've ever been to. The queue for the final quarantine checks spiralled out past the last baggage carousel - if the staff had been better organised they could have used the set up lanes and contained the crowds and queues.,,0
brisbane-airport,D Thompson,Australia,I travel often to Brisbane airport from Melbourne on business. I have observed that this airport is outdated and not very clean. The bathrooms at the Qantas and common user terminals look like they have not been cleaned since 1980. I travel to an office building not far away from the airport and pay an average of $20AUD for the trip. Every time I catch a taxi the driver gets angry because I am not traveling to Brisbane city where a taxi ride would cost $50AUD or more. It is my understanding that Brisbane Airport Corporation refuses to establish a short distance queue for taxis to avoid the taxi drivers behaviour which reflects poorly on Brisbane airport.,2,0
brisbane-airport,N Vivili,New Zealand,I always transit through bribane when traveling to PNG. My routes are always WLG-BNE-POM-BNE-WLG Clean big and informative terminal. Security staff at transit areas are sometimes pushy. Aiport has screens everywhere so you can check your flight everywhere you turn. There are power sockets in the transit lounges you can use to recharge your laptop. Currency exchange is ridiculous so I wouldn't recommend changing NZD-AUD for NZD10 I got 4AUD. A big airport you can't get lost in. Generally expensive but good!,9,1
brisbane-airport,Cheng Jun Lee,Singapore,This was my first time arriving and departing out of Brisbane. My Qantas flight from Singapore was parked at the furthest gate from immigration. Once I reached immigration it was slow and there was a very long queue. Australians were given priority to clear immigration first. Departure was more pleasant than expected. I recently read about reviews claiming that the security screenings and immigration were very slow when I went to the airport it wasn't as slow as expected. I managed to clear the security screening and immigration in 15 minutes. My flight was an Emirates flight EK433 bound for Dubai via Singapore. It was once again parked at the furthest gate away.,7,1
brisbane-airport,S Majid,Malaysia,En-route AKL-BNE-SIN. Definitely the worst airport in the world. And yes we are very well-traveled people. I can accept whatever reasons the Australian authority may have for the overkill security checks for transit passengers but being random in applying rules regarding what can or cannot be carried on flight were just outrageous. And worse of all no one at the airport could tell us who to contact in order to complain. A tiny airport with meagre facilities and nothing to enjoy. Little wonder why a lot of airlines are offering cheap flights to BNE or whatever flight that uses BNE as transit point.,,0
brisbane-airport,D Collins,Australia,I pass through BNE international twice a year - out of and into Australia from Asia where I work and usually exclusively fly Qantas. Generally I find the processing outbound good - but I do have Gold FF status so never queue for Economy. QF staff generally good. The Xpress service into Immigration is mostly not open and queues are long but the agents have generally been friendly and polite. Security screening tends to be ordered chaos but again mostly polite. Once inside you are basically at the mercy of retailers of over priced brands and so called duty free that in many instances is way above retail prices at the bigger chains. Seating is poorly distributed and caters mostly for consumers fast food so just finding somewhere to rest while waiting to board is pretty hit and miss. I do use the Qantas Business Class lounge which is usually not too crowded and definitely a bonus and worth it if you are prepared to fork out the fee for the Qantas Club; the priority boarding is also a huge bonus! Inbound I find usually OK even weaving through the Duty Free shop where at least the booze is significantly cheaper than retail. I use an ePassport now and haven't had a problem yet but even when using the agents didn't have a long wait. There's little point worrying even if it is slow because the baggage is going to be a longish time in arriving. Lifts to the various exit points outside Customs in the Arrivals Hall are far too small to handle more than about two luggage trolleys and far to few to move people at any reasonable speed or volume. Parking is obscenely expensive for anyone picking you up. My experiences in the past with the domestic terminal however are poor - unhelpful staff inefficient check-in even with the self check-in kiosks rude staff at the security screens. Overall international works OK and is at a standard comparable to any terminal I have been though anywhere around the world; domestic I found below acceptable standards but it may well have improved in recent years.,9,1
brisbane-airport,K Johnson,Australia,I travel from Newcastle NSW to Brisbane QLD Domestic terminal and back again once a week every week. I have also travelled extensively to both other Domestic terminals and international/domestic terminals. I can honestly say that Brisbane domestic terminal is the worst for friendly helpful service from the terminals 2 Bar stalls. The one in the Food court opposite Gate 5 has a very rude attitude to people using mobile phones. The other is the bar at Gate 1. Today I went to the side counter to order a beer and was told promptly to get round to the front. When asked why very short abrupt answer not allowed to serve there. It would seem we owe them the respect not vice versa. I think from now on I will bring my own drink in with me. A lot less nasty and by far a lot less cheaper.,,0
brisbane-airport,Ann Schrader,New Zealand,Possibly the worst Airport experience ever. Queued for over 50 minutes to get through immigration with only 3 staff processing hundreds of people as a result missed our connecting flight to Cairns. Airport staff couldn't have cared less with lots of staff standing round apparently doing nothing. Brisbane Airport management and staff you should be ashamed of yourselves this is not a good introduction to Australia. I have travelled extensively and have never come across such incompetence it is beyond belief in this day and age.,,0
brisbane-airport,K Joseph,Australia,Travel through Brisbane every few months not my favourite airport. Whilst international arrivals works fairly well - possibly because I tend to arrive at the right time (only one flight arriving) international departures is a pain. Last time on a Wednesday morning arrived at 7.30 am for a 9.30 am flight and took over an hour from check in to airside - long queues for security long queues for passport control. Then another long queue for refund of GST. Not enough seats airside and looking a bit worn. Glad to leave.,5,0
brisbane-airport,PJ Rior,Australia,I thought Perth international was the worst in Australia but this place takes the cake or runs a very close second. Forty five minutes to get through security this morning in chaotic unregulated conditions. Several hundred people queuing to get through the single open gate. Would have taken another half hour for immigration if not for the express card.,,0
brisbane-airport,S Limarporn,Australia,Flying in and out BNE every weekend is a pain. The worst pick up and drop off areas I've seen very poor management. Delay is a usual event on Friday evening. At least 30 mins you are going to experience when flying to BNE during peak hour.,3,0
brisbane-airport,P Schweizer,Australia,Brisbane is my home airport and am not a person to usually complain but my recent trip to Auckland left me with a bitter taste. Flying business class on EK had checked-in online and with carry-on only went straight to security and immigration. No priority security lane open at 6am but at least 50-60 people in front of me many of them being apparent first time travellers as it took ages to get through. Finally made it to immigration only to be told that I had no right to line-up in the express line as I did not have the express card from the airline. Told staff that I had checked-in at home and showed my business class boarding card but no luck so off I went behind the previous 50-60 passengers and wasted another 30 minutes. Instead of being through security in the usual 10-15 minutes it took me nearly an hour which is precious time as I needed to get some work done in the lounge. Very disappointing.,4,1
brisbane-airport,Josh Paul,Australia,The facilities and general condition of the airport is shocking. The international terminal has one food outlet open at 9pm! Transfer between terminals is poor. No bus or train after 10pm?Definitely wont be transiting thru this airport in a while.,3,0
brisbane-airport,Tony Biggar,Australia,The difference between the domestic and international terminal is like chalk and cheese with the international terminal far superior to the domestic. I would use the domestic about 6 times a year and the international about once every 18 months. With the domestic terminal not happy with the parking and drop offs general condition inside the airport choice of food outlets and like most people the flight delays. In the last 12 months none of my flights have taken off or arrived on time. Longest delay was 90 minutes. For my next trip if it is to Melbourne or Sydney thinking of flying from Gold Coast (about 60 minutes from where I live) or Sunshine Coast (about 75 minutes). With the average delay I have experienced it would be quicker. Also parking far cheaper.,3,0
brisbane-airport,V Murray,Australia,I have been using this airport for international and domestic flights several times a year for the last 25 years. There have been some improvements during that time particularly in regard to the incredibly discourteous security Immigration and Customs staff. Last weekend was shocked that my daughter was refused hot water at a coffee shop to warm up a baby's bottle. Had a very strange surreal exchange with the coffee shop manager which bordered on open hostility. Went to the baby care room no hot water facilities dirty smelly unhygienic. Terminal inside was reasonably clean but food and beverage operators rarely clean up their tables so you have to do it yourself. Outside the terminal was dirty and smelled of urine. $4 for a luggage trolley $16 for less than an hour's parking. An airport with such potential but there is a lot that lets it down.,2,0
brisbane-airport,N Samihah,Malaysia,We travelled Singapore Changi to Auckland en route (transit) at Brisbane on both legs. At the transit security check there was a long queue and only one conveyor belt and one x-ray machine. Worse it was manned by a team of slow security personnel who were rude petty and had no idea of what can or cannot be brought in. They confiscated my daughter's rice milk without any explanation or questions asked. We had a doctor's letter explaining our daughter's condition and furthermore we were aware that exceptions are made for baby food (never had any problems in Heathrow Zurich Changi). Our demand for these to be returned were ignored and instead we were greeted by some offhand remarks. We finally got the milk back after their supervisor came to our rescue.,,0
brisbane-airport,Karen Clarkin,Australia,Its ridiculous there is only one restaurant open for departing passengers before 6.30am. Surely people who have had to get up in the small hours for early check in could expect not to queue forever for a hot coffee and or breakfast at that time of day. Even worse the food was terrible. Airport managers need to get with the times and not cater as if its a small town domestic airport.,4,0
brisbane-airport,Suzanne Carruthers,Cook Islands,What a disappointing introduction to Australia this is especially after departing from a superb airport like Singapore's Changi. Dirty carpets in the transit hall grubby walls filthy toilets broken toilet seats -very below third-world standards. The departure area of the transit hall is not quite so run down and some effort has been made but toilets dirty and housekeeping poor. I would not have expected this standard in an International tourist destination.,,0
brisbane-airport,T Small,Australia,Avoid this terminal at all cost I have never experienced such a pitiful airport as this. Disembarking I walked the aerobridge - maintenance badly needed. The toilets on both arrival and departure levels are filthy. Unreadable flight Information Screens that scroll every 2 mins on arrival and departure level 1980s TV's for gate entertainment. Boarding lanes were made by these outdated mismatched tensa barriers broken and displayed throughout the terminal. Boarding gates were filthy and dust was evident. The so called express lane was a joke crew airport staff assisted passengers all channelled into one lane - waste of time. Food and Beverage outlet seating area filthy and overcrowded. Please take some ear plugs if you don't want to listen to loud screaming constant announcements. A major rethink is needed at this airport.,,0
brisbane-airport,B Maul,United Kingdom,I had the pleasure of flying out of BNE International on Dec 3. Since my first International flight back in 1985 I have only flown into and out of Oz from SYD and DRW (where I used to live). It just seemed so airy and laid back with no queues either at security (the fast track wasn't operational but there seemed to be no need for one) the shops I visited or the TRS booth. The Qantas Lounge was good again with plenty of space and reasonable selection of refreshments. Everything is also much more compact than SYD and I would love to use BNE Intl more often unfortunately most of my flights are with BA who don't fly into BNE. Of course I may have struck the airport on a quiet day it was a Monday lunchtime and that may have been to my advantage.,9,1
brisbane-airport,L Day,Australia,Short check in times friendly staff and a nice atmosphere. Never had an issue.,9,1
brisbane-airport,T Willis,Australia,I have used Brisbane airport for many years as a local and while its quite functional it just has no character or atmosphere compared to some of the other terminals but the worst part by far is the food choices available. Like all airports the prices are simply ridiculous for the rubbish on offer but as a state that has so much great local produce how is it possible that the very basic food court options are all fast food chains or pre packaged bad sandwiches. No wonder people feel bad during and after their flight. A better food experience would encourage guests to spend more and enjoy their pre departure time much more.,6,1
brisbane-airport,R Bayliss,Australia,Being a BNE local I use domestic frequently. Always a stress-free easy check-in security staff friendly enough pretty basic shopping/eating/drinking airside but decent enough if you're only waiting half an hour for a flight. Usually I catch the Airtrain which now running times have been extended is very convenient if travelling alone. Cheaper and easier to get a cab if there's 2 or more though. International is nothing special Again easy check-in clean friendly staff but for shopping/dining one would expect a bit more to impress o/s visitors. Last flight in a few weeks ago has been better than last year. Customs staff are much friendlier and it was much quicker. However baggage claim area is in desperate need of an update has the feel of a 90's office with cheap carpet and fluoro lighting. BNE has massive potential to serve as int'l gateway to Aus for Asia especially with the shabby state of SYD and MEL just needs that extra Wow! factor that all Aussie airports seem to lack. My advice? Take some architectural queues from Madrid Incheon or many other major hubs integrate cheap quick and frequent public transport and BNE would be transformed and to some extent probably Brisbane as well!,7,1
brisbane-airport,Y Ren,Australia,SYD-BNE-SYD. Haven't been to Brisbane for couple of months Brisbane domestic airport really changed. Construction for the car park finally finished - worth for the wait. The new walkway between domestic terminal train and car parks are fantastic completely new feeling for the airport. Security check area at Qantas has changed as well there is dedicated business and premium passengers line. It is very easy to drive to airport or go by train as well.,8,1
brisbane-airport,K Kanages,Australia,I never have an issue with BNE. It's never too busy it's easy to get around (particularly in arrivals) and I always find it a relaxing place to unwind and get ready for your flight. I rate them amongst the best I've been to.,9,1
brisbane-airport,A Briggs,United Kingdom,Nice enough except for the fact that almost all the passport control desks coming and going are unmanned: what is the point of that early in the morning when five international overnight flights arrive as they always do at pretty much the same time ? Ludicrous queues as far as the eye can see but what a fine array of unmanned control desks. Just as undermanned (though the concentration of flights is less so it is not so bad) leaving. Really rather unimpressive.,5,0
brisbane-airport,G James,United Kingdom,Brisbane international airport departure terminal was a pleasure to use. Check-in was smooth and unlike T3 at Heathrow you could easily see where to go. Lovely shopping area and Qantas business class lounge was fantastic. Coming in was just as good an experience - friendly staff in the quarantine section helped me throughout without much delay.,10,1
brisbane-airport,Ian Morris,Australia,It has been 6 years since the last time I was at Brisbane Airport and they still seem to be doing the same redevelopment! Signage is not good at the moment and somewhat confusing as to location of the coaches/buses from the domestic terminal. The domestic terminal is decent enough but staff could be a little more helpful. The transfer bus from domestic to international could be a little more frequent for those on tighter connections. The international terminal is a fairly typical modern airport terminal.,7,1
brisbane-airport,S Ryan,Australia,Once again typical Brisbane experience always OK leaving but coming back expect long lines at customs then waiting for bags then even longer lines for bag searches. Duty free is no longer Duty free at Australian airports. Overall experience is bad.,1,0
brisbane-airport,G Wilson,Australia,The airport is clean and easy to use both international and domestic and has basically what you need to get you on or off your flight without to much hassle.,8,1
brisbane-airport,K Verry,New Zealand,Very disappointed by airport staff especially security in departures. Brisbane is a clean friendly city and unfortunately the airport does not show this is any way. After travelling Portland-San Francisco-LAX-BNE and faced with a 13 hour transit I was stuck at the airport. With advice to clear customs I was gladly directed to facilities by information staff. As there is nothing landslide I decided to go airside and find somewhere to relax. I came down the elevators and was abruptly pulled aside to weigh my bag. This women was intimidating and rude by all accounts ripped the bag out of my hand and pushed me towards the lifts and told to check it in. I was unable to explain I was carrying medication which was exempt. After explaining I had medication that had been cleared along with the relevant paperwork I was told I was a liar. Also no Gluten free options for food and nowhere for travelers with long transits to go. Brisbane deserves some staff training and a little bit of the Brisbane culture!,2,0
brisbane-airport,Linda Halson,Australia,On arrival from LAX flight lining up for customs was a bit of a shambles - there needs to be more visible staff questioning and directing people to the appropriate lines. Customs staff were friendly however and the process took about 45 mins to get through. There were 4 international flights arriving at the same time so the wait was fine. At the Virgin/Qantas ground floor domestic transfer desks - the baggage travelator had stopped and we had to take all our bags with us on either the T bus (operated by Qantas) or TAXI to the domestic terminal. This was not the airlines fault but Brisbane Airport's. Toilet facilities in domestic airport near food court were outdated - sinks and seats clean but floor tiles grubby. International offers lots of shops - prices similar to other INT terminals and is bright and light.,4,0
brisbane-airport,T Maddern,Sweden,We flew in and out of Brisbane Domestic Airport this week. Arrivals was fine but I think it is a ridiculous scam to charge $4.00 to use a trolley. (I have never seen this in any airports I have travelled in.) Coming back the terminal temperature was very hot which I guess is to make people thirsty and need the food outlets to pay for drinks. Toilets were clean and tidy and there was plenty of space and seating.,3,0
brisbane-airport,J Hassett,Australia,For domestic flights this airport is fine but everything falls apart if you need to connect from domestic-international or international-domestic. I don't understand why they built the international terminal so far from domestic. You have to wait for the T-bus. Some passengers get a free ride and others get charged $5. I had a 1 hour 45 minute connection from domestic to international and my checked luggage didn't make it to the international flight. On return there were three incoming international flights and only 4 immigration desks open for non- Australians (the majority of passengers). There are plenty of desks but most were closed. Having waited for 30 minutes to get through immigration the luggage still hadn't arrived. It took me another 20 minutes to get through customs and I didn't even have my bags searched! Qantas have the dumbest system going. Even though your bags are checked through to your final destination and you have a boarding pass you have to check in again at the domestic transfer desk. If you don't get there an hour departure you won't make your flight. It's chaotic. I spoke to an agent and was allowed to jump the queue but it just doesn't make sense. If you have a tight connection take a taxi to the domestic terminal where you can check your bags 30 minutes before departure.,1,0
brisbane-airport,S Ryan,Australia,Clean airport heaps of seating airside but shopping is rubbish. Never had a problem leaving BNE just coming back is always a horrible experience waiting for ever for bags then a shambolic assembly while security insist on searching all bags and not xraying them. Almost 2 hours from exiting plane to walking out of the airport.,3,0
brisbane-airport,Steve Southey,Australia,Despite recent renovations the International Terminal has very few shops is overpriced on everything and the seating provided is spartan and uncomfortable. The jet ways and air-stairs are 'dated' and lack any modern decor. I feel for international visitors who are confronted with this and what their first impressions of Australia must be. The new passport chip system is poorly set up and confusing to travellers as to what their obligations are for getting through Customs.,2,0
brisbane-airport,D Silverstone,United States,Very disappointed by BNE given that Brisbane was the nicest friendliest cleanest and most modern city I visited in Oz (which covers all of them except Perth). The airport on the other hand is a bit shambolic with poor organization and surly staff both behind the counters and in security. Case in point: I politely asked for a manual inspection of my film since past experience has taught me that all it takes is one mis-calibrated machine to destroy weeks of photography. The response was hostile and wound up with several security people lecturing me about acting suspicious not reading the sign that said it was safe telling me my film case would protect them from radiation anyways and then finally putting it through the x-ray machine just to prove this (and not even apologizing when doing so revealed that the film case was NOT radiation-proof)! Shopping and food options are very limited and some gate areas have plenty of space while others overflow into narrow passageways blocking traffic. Briz definitely deserves a better terminal - and much better staff!,2,0
brisbane-airport,S Ryan,Australia,Clean plenty off seating which you need as there is nothing to do after you have had your $7 beer and $20 pizza. It feels more like a satellite airport in comparison to other airports. I agree that customs/security can be an absolute shambles when it is busy and what is the point of putting travelators in when they only go for 100 meters in a 1 km long terminal?,4,0
brisbane-airport,N Grigoriou,Australia,"Toilets and facilities are all clean. Queues are far too long though! Arriving at 1am from a long trip the first words spoken to us by an Australian were ""Are you right with filling out the forms because the sooner you fill them out the sooner we can go home! The next words spoken were at Passport control ""You should have filled out the forms on the plane!"" Welcome home!",3,0
brisbane-airport,J Couvaras,Australia,Arriving back on a Friday evening we joined a 100 mtr+ queue waiting for customs. No planning no guidance to structure - almost every man for himself - make you own queue and get there anyhow. Staff were pleasant enough but after standing for 45mins was a bit much. Eventually the overhanded intensity of checking was dramatically dropped and after a quick verbal check many passengers were allowed to pass through. Hardly a good warm or welcome experience for visitors first impressions of Australia!,3,0
brisbane-airport,N Harris,Australia,After a previous experience returning to BNE in 2007 we were met with an hour delay passing through Customs and Passport Control during the Arrivals departure upgrades. Staff were pleasant - however delays were inconvenient. Recently had the experience returning in April 2010 and a huge difference. The bio-metric gates proved a breeze to use which meant I was through passport control within minutes. We proceeded to the Something to Declare gate where we were processed within a matter of minutes after sighting the items to declare. BNE arrivals has improved beyond expectation - however due to the quick journey through passport control there was an annoying delay whilst waiting for luggage to appear on the carousel.,4,0
brisbane-airport,N Gallagher,Singapore,Construction work going on so we had a long walk ending up in the baggage collection area with no option to stay airside and had to clear security again - always very time-consuming in the domestic terminal. Not readily apparent why we couldn't have entered via a gate lounge.,3,0
brisbane-airport,S Spalsing,Australia,Parking is difficult in the domestic long-term park with frustrating delays trying to find a park - even before 8am. Adding to the frustration dozens or more of spaces are 'reserved' empty for valet parking should you wish to pay another $25 on top of the recently increased parking rate. If possible make other travel arrangements.,3,0
brisbane-airport,J Atkins,Australia,I arrived mid-morning on a China Airlines flight and transferred onto a Qantas domestic flight. Everything was fine. All queuing and waiting for customs bags and passport control was minimal with our flight and another from Japan arriving at almost exactly the same time. The process of international to domestic transfers is so easy and made pleasant by the Qantas transfer desk (who had to come running after me when i left my boarding pass on the counter). The free train (if you have a boarding pass) makes a good change from Sydney. Domestic has a reasonable range of food places.,5,0
brisbane-airport,R Liebig,New Zealand,Arriving at Brisbane airport was good hence being very far away from baggage claim passport and security although some travelators are provided when coming in on gate 75 but not all the way so whats the point of having them at all. and when departing when entering the terminal there are no screens telling you which check in desks your flight is at all then when buying some chocolate at first duty free before customs and security they tell you to pick it up after having cleared customs and security not good if you are in a hurry. Who came up with such a dumb idea of having security first and then passport control forcing you to line up and stand in a very long line and wait twice which is a total waste of time unlike all other airports where passport control is first and then security flows on from there very smoothly. Once through there are only gate direction signs in some far corner instead of straight in front of you when you leave passport control so you end up asking where to go. And when going to gate 75 which Emirates uses you walk for ages and at the end of it there is a travelator whats the point of having one at all if you have none at the beginning.,2,0
brisbane-airport,David Robertson,Australia,Not a big airport by any means and a bit crowded when we were there - however a really excellent facility. It was clean and comfortable and actually had a bit of character. Apart from the normal over-pricing of food etc (and what airport retailer doesn't do this?) this is a great airport and hugely better than SYD or MEL in my opinion.,5,0
brisbane-airport,Ron White,,Travelers to Brisbane airport need to realize that there is no free regular convenient inter terminal shuttle service between domestic and international terminals. The airport web site advises using the 'Airtrain' - or a taxi (they must be joking!) The Airtrain is in fact the regular service to the Gold Coast operating twice an hour so if you just miss one you have to spend 30 frustrated minutes on the platform from which the other terminal is clearly visible at the risk. And the train costs $4.00. (Only travellers arriving and leaving on Qantas flights have complementary travel by train.) There is a further inconvenience: getting yourself and your luggage to and from to the elevated train track; this may involve another $2.00 for the use of a trolley. There is an alternative: the airport-city mini bus service. The fare -- $3 when I last used the service - is paid at a kiosk just outside the arrivals hall and you have to wait nearby while a confusing sequence of mini buses bound for various destinations comes and goes. So inter terminal travel at Brisbane isn't a seamless experience and with trolleys and train fares factored in can cost around $6.00. . No one at the airport seems to be particularly sympathetic to the inconvenience (and cost) of this curious arrangement.,4,0
brisbane-airport,Roger Stone,,As a regular travelling through both the international and domestic terminals at Brisbane Airport I thought I would add my comments here. Compared to many airports throughout the world I have travelled through Brisbane Airport compares very favourably. Airbridges and steps to the aircraft tend to arrive quickly (unlike Heathrow for example) and immigration is mostly very efficient although I would recommend evening arrivals rather than early morning arrivals if you can plan it that way. Sitting next to passengers arriving from other countries I have noticed some confusion regarding transferring to the domestic terminal which is only about a kilometre or so away from the international terminal on the same airport and suburban trains are available for the transfer. However an odd problem I have noticed is that many in Australia seem to confuse the term 'terminal' with 'airport'. This means that you may be asked to transfer to the 'domestic airport' when arriving at the international terminal in Brisbane. Please do not be dismayed. This is in fact the 'domestic terminal' which is located on the same airport. There is no other airline-used 'domestic airport' in Brisbane separate from the main Brisbane Airport (as would be the case for example in Bangkok) The same issue applies in Sydney where the domestic and international terminals are located on the same airport despite what the confusing signs may tell you. The other main issue with Brisbane Airport is that although many flights now arrive from international destinations between 1030pm and 1am there are no trains into the city at all after about 7.30pm. The railway authorities do not seem to have realised this need. Otherwise both domestic and international terminals offer good shopping with airy walkways and plenty of parking and plenty of taxis are usually available.,4,0
brisbane-airport,Natasha Permall,,Used arrivals and departures at both domestic and international terminals recently. The international terminal reminded very much of Hong Kong. Very spacious and everything seems to run smoothly. The time to wait in security queues was minimal and there were plenty of food and shopping options. The domestic terminal is a bit more tacky but good nevertheless. Very good airport.,4,0
brisbane-airport,Steven Brown,,Used BNE to get to and from Canberra recently. Flight departed at 9.15am and must say the airport was practically dead. Bag drop was quick at Virgin and security staff were nice. Got pulled up about carrying food products on board and although professional they were still humane about it all. On the way back landing at 2pm airport was sort of being used to say the least. Baggage collection was quick and Airtrain was waiting right there. Although the airport is old it is still very functional and easy to use.,4,0
brisbane-airport,M Handley,,Landing at BNE in the morning is a bit of a mess baggage control cant seem to handle more then one plane load at a time which forms massive queues the whole stretch of the conveyor belts. weird thing is the occasional security guard will come up to you and stamp your landing card to enable you to skip this and go fasttrack - although this is pure luck and also raises the question of why have the screenings in the first place if 30% of people slip through this? Departing the airport is pretty good easy checkin desks nice airport seats despite there appearances and relatively quick luggage screenings - staff on the day were helpful and friendly - a rare thing to find in an airport!,3,0
brisbane-airport,L Cox,,Big changes at Brisbane International. The most obvious is the passport control/security bottleneck has been addressed by moving the security in front of passport control. So now the lines don't get held up by security. The new extensions are apparently going to increase the size of the terminal by 66%. The new north air bridge is really nice with leather seats lots of tables and additional F&B outlets.,4,0
brisbane-airport,T Higson,,Traveled domestically to and from Melbourne with my football team. We arrived at 6am and used Qantas' group check in. By 6.30 the bag drop line (which we didnt have to use) took some passengers over 45 minutes to check their bags in. Security was no problem at all and took only a few minutes during rush hour. Terminal is always very clean and tidy. On our return our flight was over an hour late and arrived just before 9.30pm. We arrived to a completely empty airport meaning our bags were collected rather fast. Brisbane is such a great airport both domestic and international only if they could increase the train services to the city.,4,0
brisbane-airport,P Stedman,,First time using Brisbane on Transit from Melbourne to Nadi. Based on experience I will avoid at all costs in future. Main issue is the lack of security staff and machines once going through immigration relative to number of passengers using the airport (exacerbated by stricter US Flight requirements). The security section is immediately after immigration (and I mean only 5-10 meters) and as a result the lines can back up quickly. It got to the point on the day we went through that they stopped processing passengers through immigration so the back log could clear meaning some passengers were late for their flights. Brisbane if you want to play with the big boys your International Airport needs serious work to compete. On a small point the terminal itself is miles form the end of the runway (depending on which way the wind is blowing).,2,0
brisbane-airport,D Holmes,,Have travelled through BNE International terminal 7 times over the last few months and it seems to almost be a tale of two airports. Outbound I have no problem whatsoever there are rarely any queues (of more than a few minutes long) for security and passport control. Check in is always a breeze again I have never queued for more than a minute or two. The facilities once you get through customs/security are fine too. There's a fair selection of eateries and seating and it's generally clean and tidy. Coming back is a different matter - I've had queues of up to 45 minutes for immigration (as a non-Australian passport holder) and the same again for quarantine. Just what you need after a 24 hour plus flight.,3,0
brisbane-airport,D Dale,,Transfer from Brisbane Domestic Terminal to Brisbane International Terminal seamless. Quick ride across on Airtrain link. Check-in at Qantas was fast with only a short queue. However a long queue was encountered at customs which resulted in a half an hour 'crawl' to the customs officer. Customs officer was polite and at this time every customs station was manned. Another 20 minute wait to pass through security. It appears that queues form in the morning (as I encountered) but afternoons are quite relaxed as shown when arriving at 4.30PM. Quick check through immigration and customs again with polite customs staff. Bags quick to be out on carousel. Departing from aircraft to leaving terminal would have been 25 minutes. Prefer Brisbane and Melbourne International Airports over Sydney.,4,0
brisbane-airport,G Wilson,,Checked in on line so went to bag drop & then to security check all in 5 minutes. Arrival - walked from plane to baggage claim to find bags already on belt. Good variety of shopping/eating outlets for domestic terminal. The only failure is the airtrain. It doesnt run after 8pm & with many domestic flights arriving & departing after this plus international departures it would make sense to run it longer as it offers a good service.,4,0
brisbane-airport,Simon Uglow,,"Brisbane Airport - inbound international - we were lucky at customs as we were at the back of a long queue when a friendly customs official starting checking from the back and cleared us through really quickly. Once outside though the scrum to get a lift to the car park was dreadful. Outbound international - we decided to use the train (a long slow journey and not an ""express"" by any stretch of the imagination) which did take us straight to the terminal. Once inside and checked in went through to departures but were disappointed in two things - no lounge in International accepting Priority Pass and the standard and spread of offering of catering was poor - not much better than Bristol.",3,0
brisbane-airport,Keith Jenkins,,Entry through Brisbane International was simple fast and with no problems. Immigration staff very friendly informative and dealt efficiently with a smile on their faces! A nice welcome to Australia especially in the evening - thank you. Exiting was a similar pleasure - no problems friendly staff varied selection of retail outlets fairly priced. This must be one of the easiest airports to exit with a hire car. Thank you to the lady at Red Spot who said I could follow her out of the airport to the motorway - nice touch. In conclusion a quality airport,5,0
brisbane-airport,Trevor Hoad,,Cleared passport control in 10 minutes despite a JAL 747 arriving at the same time and my bag was quickly on the baggage belt. Bought a return Air Train ticket to Roma Street station for $24 and checked in to the hotel just over an hour after landing. The domestic terminal for my onward flight to Darwin was very busy with a massive queue for the bag drop off desk. Once through security there were plenty of seats and a reasonable choice of shops and dinning options.,3,0
brisbane-airport,Tyler Higson,,Used the Domestic terminal the Qantas area. Just a quick credit to Qantas as well as BNE airport here the 'Quick Check' kiosks are very good and there are lots of them. It was very easy and took me 45 seconds to check in. Just a tip the Bag Drop line can be very long! Security was not an issue. They did there job I did mine no one got 'hurt'. I dont see why so many people complain on security when they are doing there job. I have gone through Brisbane a few times Domestic and International and I have never had a problem with security. Up stairs after security Plenty of shops all open (it was 2pm anyway) with your pick of coffees Subway Pies also a Newsagent with nearly everything in it for the flight. Toilets were very clean a credit to the cleaning staff at the airport everything was clean. But once I had to go up to the concourse to my gate there was only one little coffee shop with big prices. At those gate areas it was a large area with a good area to watch the planes take off and land. Im starting to find this airport easier and more comfortable than Sydney in some ways. Anyway good airport with good clean facilities.,4,0
brisbane-airport,Ken Matthews,,BNE international. Once my favourite airport. I arrived at the same time as a number of other flights. Not enough immigration officers on duty so 25 min wait. Rude and unpleasant. Luggage collection - another 15 mins. Tried to report missing luggage but no one there anyway. 25 min wait for customs. A long line with Japanese tourists having no idea what to do and being yelled at by immigration staff in English. Nice welcome. Staff in food and drink area told me long waits are normal as are complaints. Will use SYD in future.,,0
brisbane-airport,D Walker,,BNE domestic. Getting a bit crowded these days with passengers and looking a bit worn. Last air train during the week/weekend leaves at around 7pm from the city. To bad if you have a later flight. Toilets in the terminal building need some attention. Upstairs in the gate areas the food or lack of it is bad with the mere basics at crazy prices with less choice. No real loungers apart from 2 in the Aromours coffee lounge area.,,0
brisbane-airport,R Tolkien,,Note that there are no busses or trains departing Brisbane city for the airport after about 7.00pm. I just found out about this the hard way.,,0
brisbane-airport,Tyler Higson,,"Just came back from a stay in Japan. I departed and arrived in BNE. Going out immigration was a breeze and all the shops were open at 6 am but the coffee shop before immigration is way overpriced. Shops after formalities are good. A little overpriced but hey its a airport! Got on the flight easy. Comiming home the signage was clearly posted. ""Transat go to the left Customs go to the right"" It was time consuming going through Passport control and customs. After customs and in the arrival hall not much is on offer. Only Currency exchange and car hire desks. Good little airport but could use a few more shops after arrival!",,0
brisbane-airport,Louis Fotinos,,"As Brisbane is my home town and I travel extensively for business (mainly domestic) I use the airport a lot. The domestic terminal although a well designed building can be stretched for capacity at peak times. QANTAS check in although automated still lacks enough staff at peak times with the queue winding out the doors. Security checks are very quick and thorough with polite staff. A travelator on the Qantas pier like on the Virgin one is a must. Baggage collection is fairly quick (unlike Melbourne). The International terminal is again stretched at peak times both departing and arriving. Again QANTAS check in is inadequate where even Club check in takes far to long. Security is again fast and efficient but Customs both inbound and outbound seem to be stretched to the limit of their capabilities even with all counters and personel working. Transport to and from BNE is it's biggest downfall. Very farsighted in developing a rail link but let down by poor frequency the Airtrain even though very heavily marketed is not an attractive option for frequent travellers. I have used the service many times and it is fast reliable comfortable and not too expensive when compared to comparable services in other countries. The only problem is that it ceases operation far to early in the evening for when I'm returning. If you don't make it easy for people to use it they won't! The consequence is the traffic snarls which occur every evening with people waiting for passengers to arrive. Again the airport should consider a ""stay in your car"" parking area short of the terminals for such use.",,0
brisbane-airport,Thomas Beale,,Both domestic and international airports are reasonable in my view for most aspects of travel. Checking in when travelling interstate on business is very fast with the modern machines. The real problem is the airtrain - it is becoming non-existent. The last train is at 19:30 and it seems that the service has been downgraded to about half-hourly even around 6pm the time I last went out to the airport 2 weeks ago. There are flights coming in way past this time and the service needs to be every 15 minutes to have any hope of being used. And it is too expensive. In general the transport situation at Brisbane airport is a complete disaster. Due to the limited usability of the train most people are still in the mode of being picked up or dropped by family members to avoid the huge taxi fares especially from the west side (I did it recently - $55). The traffic out there is out of control. This is a joke - no other modern city I have been to in recent years in Australia western Europe and even the US has such poor transport options from its major airport. Sydney Berlin Atlanta Amsterdam Heathrow Paris Lyon Seville Hong Kong Singapore Narita and many others all have excellent public transport to the airport. What is wrong with Brisbane?,,0
brisbane-airport,Anil Kattula,,Used Qantas domestic terminal for arrival and departure in March. Arrival was good but why are there no moving walkways in the Qantas pier? They are in the Virgin pier and have been since the days of Ansett! Also signage airside to indicate way to baggage claim is not clear. Departure excellent using new Qantas self check in. Staff friendly and assisted when had minor problem -apparently I wasn't touching screen hard enough! Security strict but very polite. Ran explosive material detector over our twin stroller!. Two new food courts airside good.,,0
brisbane-airport,Steve Conroy,,It is very spacious clean and tidy and accomodates crowds very well in the check-in area and departure gates. Airside Shopping has improved significantly since it opened in 1995. On the down side queues for customs and immigration on arrival can be long and Customs and AQIS staff just don't seem to understand that they also have an ambassadorial role to play. However these problems are hardly unique to Brisbane. I have had far longer lines (and far worse treatment) in Sydney and Melbourne. Ever tried arriving at T4 at LAX in peak time??? In summary - Brisbane International is a clean and spacious airport and particularly well suited to the frequent business traveller. It also caters well for families with large amounts of baggage. Customs and immigration could use a bit of an attitude change - but what airport is perfect in that regard?,,0
brisbane-airport,Melanie Haigh,,As a new resident in Queensland I have not used the international terminal from Brisbane before- what a disappointment. The facilities upon leaving are not what you expect of an international airport - no decent restaurant or bar area. The seating is almost non existent except at the departure gates. The shopping is woeful. The current airport seems to have totally outgrown the obvious traffic of international travellers and needs to be upgraded. Upon arrival its just as bad with the number of immigration desks catering for everyone. I arrived early in the morning when the number of arrivals is heaviest and the lines were huge for both Australian and non Australian passport holders. Its not a good first impression of Australia for those newcomers and makes me wish to still be travelling through Sydney.,,0
brisbane-airport,Vijesh Sreedharan,,I have travelled through Brisbane Airport many times including domestic flights and international flights. Although the last domestic flight arriving in Brisbane is around midnight there are no shops open to cater to have a bite for the visitors and family who are waiting to receive their loved ones. Also in the international terminal there are flights leaving around midnight but none of the shops are open during that time. For eg. there is Singapore Airlines departing almost near midnight but there wouldn't be anything open after the passenger has checked in and if he wishes to grab a bite before he leaves. Also the Airtrain facility stops at 1930hrs(which is the last train to the city). After that you need to find your own means of transport or catch a cab (which could cost you a fortune if you are staying in the western suburbs). Since they have flights departing till midnight they could have trains running till then if not frequent but at least in frequency of an hour or so.,,0
brisbane-airport,Yvonne Kohunui,,Over the years I have frequently travelled from Brisbane to NZ many times. My main concern is the lack of customs staff at the customs counters in the arrivals hall at Brisbane International Airport. On many occasions I have waited two hours to get through to the customs counters. Perhaps customs need to employ more staff to decrease the waiting time for passengers and increase the efficiency of a relatively new airport that promoted a quicker service to passengers when it first opened.,,0
bristol-airport,Mikael Tonér,Sweden,"Unpaved rental car area, long walk without shelter (luckily no rain) to terminal. Airport homepage recommended to be at airport at least 2 hrs before departure. No early check-in, self-check-in did not work with our airline. Charging for trolleys, self-weighing of luggage, and limited wi-fi. Rip-off Intl should be the name of the place! Staff at information point were nice, but could answer my questions. Security staff impolite - words ""please"", ""sir"" or ""madam"" did not seem to exist. Security people at other apts seem to do their job properly without being unfriendly and rude. Upstairs after security check, the place was OK. Of course, that is where money is spent. OK number of seats at gate though, and very clean.",2,0
bristol-airport,Sean Mclaughlin,United Kingdom,It would be nice to be able to eat something without feeling fleeced.

bristol-airport,Morgan Dye,United Kingdom,"I last travelled through Bristol airport around eight or nine years ago and I remember it being pretty decent for an airport of its size. This time around I was disappointed. Firstly, the security check. If you've forgotten a small plastic bag for your carry on liquid items you are encouraged to pay out £1 for a bag - don't bother doing this! Once through there were staff handing them out for free. Not sure why they do this, Heathrow and most other airports seem to give the bags out for free. The security check itself was awful. The queue was unbelievable and crawled along at a snails pace. The low ceilinged queuing area was stiflingly hot and the whole thing was just bad. Compare this to my last flight from Heathrow when I zipped through in 10 mins, max. Once through, the facilities on offer aren't too bad, but the terminal building felt very dingy and closed off, there were no windows that offered views out onto the runway area. I'm sure there were last time I flew from here. The walk from the terminal building to the boarding gate for my flight was also epic. Admittedly, that isn't necessarily a problem unique to Bristol. Coming back, again the walk to immigration and baggage reclaim was a real epic, worse than going out. That said, bags came off quickly and the joy of a small airport is that you're out and on your way pretty quick. I've been told that Bristol is undergoing a bit of an upgrade, so be to be fair some of my gripes may be resolved in the future. If you're flying this summer though, prepare for some long and sweaty queuing at security.",4,1
bristol-airport,Mick Campbell,United Kingdom,"This airport is just a disaster. I arrived this morning from Poland with Ryanair (an airline I'm always happy with, by the way) to find myself walking what seemed like miles down endless corridors until I ended up queuing in a stairwell just to get to passport control. When I finally got in there with what looked to me like 800 others, we were herded like sheep around pens in a suffocatingly-hot room, making slow shuffling progress towards the head of the queue. When I finally got there, I asked the woman jobsworth who was pointing everyone to the different desks why they didn't broadcast an apology for the ridiculously long wait, and why they didn't turn some ventilation on. She completely ignored me. This is what the unknowing foreign traveller is confronted with on arriving. A nasty impression. The staff at Bristol all need a good kick up the backside.",1,0
bristol-airport,D Simon,United Kingdom,"Flying out could not be simpler apart from when you are booked with a no thrills airline you need hiking shoes on for the long distance you need to walk. Coming into Bristol is another adventure in itself. Forget the 3 mile hike its the queues for passport control that are beyond a joke. Everything is slowed down and you are herded like cattle into market single file round and round barriers until you lose the will to live. Forget the ""express"" lane the new technology is slow and very much dictatorial. You know you are back in Blighty with all the you must do this signs. Border control staff need to be taught how to be polite too. The chap who greeted us barked out his questions akin to being trained by uncouth barbarians.",,0
bristol-airport,Jeanne McKenzie,United Kingdom,I asked for assistance to travel to Cyprus I am 80 years old and disabled wonderful help getting onto the plane. Excellent help at Paphos excellent help to get me on the plane coming back you push a button in the disabled parking area and they bring out a wheelchair that you sit in until you enter the plane having gone up on the lift. When I arrived back at Bristol what a dreadful shock I had I asked for the use of the wheelchair that was on the lift that came up to the plane - I was refused I did not get a hand or arm to get off the lift left to walk unaided to a mini bus no help to get on no help to get off. I managed to find a wheelchair in the arrival disabled dept to be told we have nobody to push you. During this I kept calm not wanting to distress myself I realise I should have done things differently and sat in the plane until the assistance I had asked for and told I would get came about.,,0
bristol-airport,S Frith,United Kingdom,I flew from this airport on Sunday 5th April 2015 to Reykjavik along with my mother on EasyJet flight EZY6001 our first time of flying with this firm and from this airport. After going to the baggage drop-off and having my suitcase weighed and labelled I mentioned that it was hand luggage and the member of staff said he did not know what I meant! Eventually the problem was sorted out but it would be more than helpful if there were signs saying where passengers with just hand luggage have to go to check in rather than have them queue in the wrong place. It would also be helpful if there could be signs (or staff) telling people well in advance when they will need to show their passport / boarding cards and what needs to be placed in the trays for scanning rather than wait until passengers are at the scanners and therefore causing unnecessary delays. On the return journey (EZY6002 on 9 April 2015) we were rudely told to show the glossy photo to the scanner and stand on the footprints on the floor. My mother and I had no idea what the two female members of staff meant and eventually one of them took my passport and showed the photo to the scanner but once we stood on the footprints the two members of staff wandered off leaving us unsure what to do next - the picture on the machine was confusing. After several minutes the two staff members were altered to the fact that we were still standing on the footprints and returned to tell us we could go through the gate all of which could have been prevented if the staff had taken the time to explain the procedure and waited to check that we had understood rather than wander off for a gossip! Finally could all airport staff remember that they do their job every day and know the routine but a lot of the travellers going through this airport may be a nervous first time flyers in a different country or tired from a long haul or early flight and would appreciate being treated with courtesy and having any problems dealt with politely. Travellers can be stopped from flying if they are aggressive or rude to staff so could airport workers return the courtesy as good manners cost nothing but go a long way!,5,0
bristol-airport,P Cullen,United Kingdom,As a regular user I have often complained about the long walk to/from flights. The good news is that the new gates require a much shorter walk and there is far more seating than at the western apron. Note however that many flights do still go from the western gates so you may not be lucky. Early morning is always the busiest time but on my last visit the wait for security was about 5 minutes (though getting through took another 5 minutes as I kept setting the scanner off never found out why). Return was OK but could be better the usual lengthy wait for immigration checks but at least one of the officers took the time to explain why using the scanners is often no quicker than queuing for a manual check. There are still irritating things about Bristol (expensive car parks paying for trolleys limited seating in some areas) but it is in the mid range of UK airports from my experience.,5,1
bristol-airport,A Rowlands,United Kingdom,Large areas for check in great but facilities in the departure lounge were appalling. We were travelling with a small baby and needed to warm a bottle no signage and few people to help. The space for departures was far too small for the number of people trying to use the facilities. On departure went to gate with push chair but no staff around and had to carry it down a full flight of stairs no lift signs and no ramp.,,0
bristol-airport,Mark Taylor,United Kingdom,First the good news. Given this is a small airport averaging around half a dozen departures per hour you are unlikely to face a long queue on the runway for take off or for that matter to have to circle around for ages to land. Also the check in queues were not too bad albeit I flew during the off peak season. But that is about all there is good to say. The whole point of little airports is they should be easy to use very short walks from the plane to the exit. Instead it has been designed without airbridges so you usually need a bus to get to the plane. You will also face long walks with no moving walkways (mine on return was over 1/4 mile) along with going up and down stairs (again no escalators). Anyone with young children and pushchairs or elderly and infirm should take careful note. Access is horrendous as the airport is in the middle of nowhere without any sensible connection to the M4 or M5. Most people will either have to go through Bristol or across windy minor roads. The parking is basically in a dirty great big field poorly concreted and open to the elements so if it's raining you will get drenched. All this for parking prices on a par with LHR and Gatwick despite the airports rural location. Helpfully the short term car park is also sited in a dip so you face a big uphill lugging of your cases while the rain pelts you. If you want a trolley it's £2 per trolley non refundable. Even Gatwick and LHR don't do that! Generally I like small airports because what you lose in facilities you gain in ease of use and lower cost. But not here.,2,0
bristol-airport,Jules Weekes,France,"I have been disappointed with the security staff on a number of occasions now at Bristol Airport. At first I put it down to a stressful and difficult job exasperated by the heavy turn-over of passengers but now that I have experienced rudeness on 3 occasions I feel I should bring it to the attention of the airport itself. Myself and my wife are frequent flyers. We live in Dijon and travel back to the UK numerous times a year to see friends and family. The airports we use regularly vary between Paris Geneva Lyon Bristol and Glasgow and its disappoints me that the worst experience we have with security staff is at Bristol Airport. On two occasions I have been spoken to abruptly and rudely about items in my baggage. The first was while removing my wash-bag the assistant asked about electrical items and I explained I had none. He abruptly commented about my camera and I explained I didn't have one. He then pointed to the bag I was about to open saying I needed to remove my camera at which point I removed my clear plastic bag of liquids. He made no apology but simply said he thought it was a camera. On the second occasion I was travelling with a nutri-bullet in my bag. This as you'd expect caused some interest with the scanner operator so I explained what it was to him for no other reason than to help. He then accusingly responded saying ""I know"" and stated that if the blades were too long it would get confiscated. I was simply trying to help and understood the implications of the blade length. The staff were also rude to my wife last week while she was travelling alone. She had removed her liquids from her wash-bag but had another make-up bag which had no liquids within it. Again more accusatory comments about removing items that weren't actually present. I could give more examples of comments and demands of the staff but these haven't been directed at me but passengers around me. My complaint is at what point did the staff think it was acceptable to be so rude an ""excuse me"" or ""please and thank you"" don't cost anything. And why do they feel the need to be so hostile and accusatory? Sadly at the moment the airport is portraying quite the opposite through what I assume is a negative culture developed within the security section and assumption that everyone passing through is an idiot and will not have complied with the rules.",2,0
bristol-airport,S Brown,United Kingdom,The £1 for dropping off someone and saying goodbye within 30 seconds is a total rip off. The££2 for a trolley just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I will never use this money pinching rip off airport again! It's indicative of the greedy money grabbing society we have now become part off what where they thinking of when they sanctioned this.,,0
bristol-airport,C Maurer,Germany,"I am a Lufthansa frequent traveller with lots of international flights in one month. This was my first experience with Bristol. The airport itself is ok. The rental car pick up was a longer walk in the rain (with luggage). From there to the car it was again a long walk without signs giving directions. Car return was ok. The most negative experience to report is the security staff. They definitely are over fulfilling their duty and for my feeling they really feel ""mighty"". They opened my on-board trolley took everything out. They opened my toilet bag and inspected each single item. They opened a cotton bag with flip flops in it. They opened the container of my toothbrush. They separated ""liquids"": shaving cream tooth paste nivea aftershave etc. from ""hardware"": USB charger UK mains adaptor etc. Everything was put into 5 different containers and put into X-ray a second time. Afterwards they confiscated my beloved corkscrew (no knife short screw) which accompanied me for years and years to many different countries. When I carefully wanted to complain they murmured something about ""Germany"". This is not serving passengers this security is an assault to passengers. I will avoid Bristol airport whenever possible.",,0
bristol-airport,Tom Watts,United Kingdom,"It really is staggering how bad Bristol Airport is for a regional British airport. The problems start with actually getting to the place the bus is hugely expensive (£7 from the station compared to say £3.20 for the metro from the station to the Airport in Newcastle (which is a further distance but much faster) hugely impacted by traffic - there are no bus lanes on the route into the city and without alternative apart from taxis or private hire. If you drive to the airport then you better not follow the signs because you won't really get there well not in anything remotely resembling a reasonable time as the signing routes you out of the city then back into the centre again before directing you back out this is to avoid a residential area but that doesn't make it any less frustrating. Check-in/bag drop is usual for a regional airport not good but it works in the height of summer its a nightmare but otherwise its reasonably organised and as its quite a small area it works ok. Security is usually quite well organised but the staff are the worst I have ever experienced in the entire world. Its really tragic I usually make some kind of error even though I try really hard not to its like they're trying to catch you out the liquids rules are followed with an iron fist! I was once taken into a private room for having a ""hidden compartment"" in my bag this was actually just an interior pocket that the security person was unable to open I offered to help but was told to not interfere and then taken to a private room.... brilliant. I also walked through with a chap stick in my pocket which was found during a routine pat down apparently I was trying to ""smuggle liquids on board"" and the offending chap stick was placed through the x-ray. The departure area is hilarious firstly this is the only airport I've ever been to where the largest shop is a Claires Accessories. Not that it isn't an important thing to have in the airport but its not going to help get around the fact that there is no-where decent to buy a sandwich except starbucks which is tiny and often sold of most things by the evening. The seating isn't bad once you work out there's an upstairs but overall the whole place is poorly laid out and several of the gates queue straight into the main shopping area which while nicely avoiding a long walk does make the whole place disorganised. To compare Bristol to larger airports would be unfair but even compared to other similar regional airports is a disaster I've been to most airports in the UK and every time I'm in Bristol I'm always surprised that it is just as bad as I remember it being.",2,0
bristol-airport,Rob Payne,United Kingdom,I wasn't expecting a good experience based on a lot of recent reviews but was surprised how nice Bristol Airport has become. We might not have travelled in peak summer but we did travel at the peak of the day ie 7am. I found security queues short staff polite the whole departure area bright clean with a reasonable amount of seating. When called to the gate the ability to walk to the gate rather than being bussed was a much better experience than previous years. There was plenty of retail opportunities and I didn't find the prices that expensive compared with other airports. Car Parking we parked in premier only 2-3 mins walk from the terminal and again prices no more than other airports. Returning 3 days later the experience again was very pleasant from first arrival to picking up the car. The only thing which puzzled me was having to wait in the cold wet environment as our aircraft parked right in front of the main terminal to allow buses to move along the roadway between the aircraft parking bay and the building. We are the ones getting wet the people in the bus if there were any were in the dry? Why not allow us priority over those buses. Would most definitely use Bristol again.,9,1
bristol-airport,Peter Hardcastle,Spain,Good if you are a queuing fan otherwise prepare to become irritated - the airport infrastructure is unable to cope with the traffic flowing through it. Long queues both inbound and outbound - I've used it three times for return trips in the last month. But the cost of flights from Bristol seem to be lower than elsewhere so that's the choice. Road access is not good having to hack through Bristol city from the North - use the A4 from the M5 slow but better than following the signs that take you through the city (from the M4). Friday afternoon access from the South is even worse OK during the daytime but very long queues to the traffic lights at Congresbury approaching via the A370 from the South. So in summary it does the job OK if you can stay calm in the queues and leave plenty of time for road access. Staff seem indifferent but who cares!,2,0
bristol-airport,Chris Trebble,United Kingdom,Jaded and in need of a facelift. Facilities in the departure area are tatty and run down. You can get anything you like to eat providing it's an unhealthy and unappetising burger! Arrival area facilities are also poor. ePassports take longer to process than traditional passports and charging for trolleys is an absolute insult to incoming passengers who are normally tired and travel weary at this stage and need less hassle rather than more. Obviously the airport operators are more concerned with grabbing money from their hapless customers rather than with the quality of the service they should be providing. Years ago Bristol offered a friendly local airport that was both convenient and a pleasure to use. Alas that is no more. I've been fortunate enough to experience travels that have taken me to airports across the World but unfortunately Bristol ranks at the bottom of the list.,,0

bristol-airport,Gary Colburn,United Kingdom,A more than adequate airport for the west of England compact clean and staff are curt but efficient.

bristol-airport,R Burdon,France,We have used this airport over a number of years purely for closeness to our destination. However I have had enough! paying £3 for 23 minutes in the express parking and £2 to use a trolley is legalised profiteering. My Local International airport gives you 15 minutes free Parking and free use of trolleys. They even provide free tokens to use for the trolleys! It is a real pleasure to go there. You feel treated like a customer not a profit centre to be milked for as much as possible as quickly as possible. There is limited seating unless you spend your time in the bar / restaurant area enjoying the sixties decor. The Car rental area is located in a depression which is difficult to access when you have heavy luggage even when you are fit! The offices are like a big shed with limited space to stand inside if there are many people waiting to get cars. If is raining you could get very wet queuing outside. The cars are parked on a gravelly/muddy area. No fun when it is raining either for you your shoes or luggage. If you are travelling with someone leave them with the luggage at the shed and bring the car round and load there. The approach and exiting of the parking area is poorly marked and dangerous. There are certainly plenty of staff around to stop you doing anything that might conflict with the jobs worth mentality although there are some who will help. Herded at gates which reminded me of pens at a cattle market with virtually no where to sit. No I am not going to sit on a floor which has been tramped over by hundreds of shoes in good clothes! Some security staff are simply unpleasant and aggressive is it really too much for them to be polite to us. Avoid it.,1,0
bristol-airport,Alan McBride,United Kingdom,"Very disappointing and serious lack of manners amongst the security staff especially the two individuals I encountered on Thursday 4th September past. First encounter involved a woman impatiently beckoning me through the metal detector with a curled up finger as though I were a small child then rudely nodding in the direction of my possessions (as if I hadn't been watching them like a hawk and didn't already know where they were). Second encounter was the man who asked me to unpack my bag then went about confiscating various items (shampoo shaving foam deodorant etc.). He then proceeded to ask if I wanted them back upon my return (almost £25 worth) to which I replied of course. To this he responded ""well it'll cost you six quid mate"". I have to say I found the whole security experience patronising and insulting to say the least few of the staff seem to have any manners and someone should also point out to Bristol airport security staff who actually pays their wages. Needless to say I won't use this airport again unless I'm desperate. Oh and I almost forgot some of the surfaces in the long stay car park are in appalling condition £52 shame on them.",4,0
bristol-airport,A Finn,United Kingdom,I'm a regular user. Quick access from city centre by regular frequent bus. A bit over-priced at £11 return for a 20 minutes journey each way but cheaper than cabs. The on-airport cab service costs about £28 one way to the city which is £8 more than other minicab companies. The airport is generally efficient and quick to get through because it is small. Security usually copes but can get congested at peak times. If you forget a plastic bag for your liquids don't buy one as they will give you one. Three things that ought to change: they ought not to charge people dropping off and picking up and staying for less than 10 minutes - it just annoys people and they spend the money they earn from it employing security staff in trucks to drive around trying to stop people dropping off and picking up outside the designated area. They ought to provide a tap somewhere after security so you can refill your water bottle - they only provide hot water in the toilets. Both these things are obviously about earning a few more quid but they are mean spirited and undermine customer goodwill and that is just bad for business. Finally they ought like most decent airports these days to provide free good quality no strings attached wifi for an hour. With these things we would love Bristol airport. As it is we use it but dislike the people that run it.,5,1
bristol-airport,Simon Main,United Kingdom,Flew to Chania with Ryanair had to go to gate 16. A 450 meter walk with 2 kids is not fun and the same on the way back. A 1/2 hour wait to go through immigration is a small price to pay. Would recommend BRS.,8,1
bristol-airport,B J Hodge,United Kingdom,Highs and lows. To drop off a passenger is charged a minimum of £1. Car stopped probably for fifteen seconds max charge levied. They should advise on the Express drop off sign that there is a charge. Pathetic toilet provision. After security downstairs toilets out of use requiring a journey up the very congested staircase to the food court to find that the total provision of toilet cubicles for male passengers at what pretends to be an international airport is five. Security was quick and courteous. Finally and I realise that it is not the fault of Bristol but happens everywhere why oh why do we have to show our boarding card to buy a packet of mints.,4,0
bristol-airport,S Crowe,Canada,"Having read with much horror the reviews on BRS which came after we had booked our YYZ-AMS-BRS flights I approached our visit with trepidation. However it was not all that bad. Sure we had a bit of a short stroll from the plane and then a long walk along the passageways to Customs up and down some stairs (with carry-on(s) (a generous 12 kg. from KLM) and Schiphol duty-free bag) but I've seen it just as bad in ""big"" airports. Customs was a bit of a cattle-pen (area is still under renovation) but as expected we ""foreigners"" being only a few got through pretty quickly. Our companions who had the newest UK ""chip"" passports also zipped through. Old UK/Euro passports took forever being 90% of the arrivals. From that point is was fine. The luggage came along right away and we were off in no time. A quick stop in the ""tough-free"" loo and we trundled down to the car hire building. So far it was just like last time nothing had really changed at all except for the new arrival gate additions and the marathon walking. Sadly time came to go home. It was more of the same old same old. Same KLM check-in desk same way up to same Security area (I had bought 3. Fast Track passes on-line with a promo code on the BRS website) and straight into the Aspire lounge. As we could not buy cheaper ""Green Tag"" liquor because of going to Amsterdam we bypassed Duty Free and spent all our time in the lounge (who wouldn't?) and then directly out to the gate. Again a bit of a walk but it was not bad only a tad crowded at the gate. I assume the gates assigned are based on the plane capacity and some are gate areas are larger. (KLM is an E-190 at only 100 pax). All in all I have few qualms with BRS (except it should have been closed years ago and the City made Filton into a major West England airport instead) despite the £'s you'll spend for luggage weighing plastic security bags emergency carry-on tote bags trolleys refreshments etc. 2 notable side issues the currency exchange rates are criminal the check-in luggage belts have the scales turned off so you can't sneak a weight check for free. One small tip don't let relatives or friends pay to access the ""drop off / pick up"" terminal area use the car hire lot across the roadway.",7,1
bristol-airport,G Elliott,United Kingdom,"Last time I visited Bristol Airport I drove from Basingstoke through City Centre. The signs were either non existent or grown over with vegetation. Security was a nightmare although I had no liquids that needed to be confiscated I am always very careful I was told my plastic bag didn't ""conform"" and I had to buy a new one costing £1 although I was just feet from the departure lounge. When I asked for the security guys name he put his hand over his name badge and said he didn't have to tell me! With this and the long long walk to the gates Bristol Airport no longer appeals and I prefer to get a train to Birmingham airport. My son who has to travel from Bristol says it is a nightmare getting a taxi now. A shame as from October there will be no more flights from Exeter to Spain so Bristol could have benefited but not from me.",1,0
bristol-airport,L Cole,United Kingdom,For the last three years we have used Bristol airport for our annual holiday and on each occasion have been greeted by the rudest surliest arrogant security staff. On each encounter whilst being herded through the various security checks at this airport we were greeted with raised voices beckoning fingers aggressive and downright insulting comments. I would not tolerate this in my workplace and if this is how they think that they should behave when being confronted by a mass of humanity in an unfamiliar environment then they really need to rethink they're chosen vocation after all we are paying the wages here. Customer excellence and relationship training urgently required.,4,0
bristol-airport,Lawrie Hall,United Kingdom,Traveled to Girona with Ryanair. If what you want of an airport is somewhere you can check-in without hassle spend less than 5 minutes going through security have a good cooked breakfast and get on your plane then Bristol at 0800 on a Tuesday morning is just that. Parked as ever with 'DellBoy's parking' and bussed to the terminal. Return from Girona arriving 1930 on a Friday 5 minutes through immigration picked up by DellBoy and off home. Not bad.,9,1
bristol-airport,C Tinley,United Kingdom,This once pleasant airport is now a shopping centre with scant regard with the fact that we're to catch a plane. First the plus queuing for security is usually good or excellent. General seating is poor. They have recently stopped announcing departures which is lazy beyond belief. They've allowed WHSmith to ask for boarding cards in spite of the fact it is nothing to do with them where you're travelling and certainly not a requirement. They charge for pick up/ drop off which is just greedy. Overall the impression you get is that the wallet is more important than you are and it is no pleasure to fly from Bristol.,2,0
bristol-airport,Ben Jones,United Kingdom,"I fly every week from this awful airport and have to say it gets worse every time. The security staff have no regard for passengers. My last trip involved a security attendant calling me out! This was because I had put my bag in the tray provided in order for it to be x-rayed I assumed all was ok for me to proceed until he looked at me rather aggressively and said ""get your bag out of the tray""! The parking is dire the toilets are dire the staff are dire too! I have been traveling out of Bristol for some 3 years now and it gets worse every time.

bristol-airport,A Marks,United Kingdom,Flew from BRS - EFL on Thursday 29 May 2014. Parked on site at the airport in long stay opposite the departures doors no queue at check-in no queue at security. Was all clean inside departures 30 minutes free wifi a few shops and bars and the benefit of an outdoor smoking area after security! Overall Bristol airport is great some people complain about the 10 minute max walk to the furthest departure gates all I can say to that is try Heathrow Gatwick or Birmingham and the walks are far longer! My only down point is the service in some of the shops was a bit lacklustre but the bar staff were excellent.,9,1
bristol-airport,Lorraine Murray,United Kingdom,"I don't usually write bad reviews I'm not fussy and don't let things get to me. However I won't be flying from Bristol again. We had to check in at 5am for a 7am flight. The queue to check in was incredibly slow moving and we stood in it until 6am. Told that our flight was boarding which I queried but was told again that it was. So we walked to the boarding gate (a long walk - I can't see why a newish airport should be so badly designed and without travelators). When we got to departures we went straight to the gate as I thought that's what we had to do although I'd previously planned to buy some water and a newspaper and have a coffee. We went through the checks at the boarding gate and then stood there again in a queue until we were allowed on the plane at around 7am (late - it seems they had ""mislaid"" the crew). Once on board there were no hot drinks as they hadn't been loaded. I'm telling everyone to avoid Bristol Airport!",2,0
bristol-airport,G Leadbetter,United Kingdom,My colleagues and I regularly use most UK airports through our business. Our general consensus is the Bristol is possibly the UK's worst airport. Here's why: The airport's poor design (requiring buses for many boardings) leads to overcrowding in departures worsened by the amount of space used up by the disproportionate duty free shops. Facilities are no way near up to demand with constant queues for the toilets and the Soho Coffee outlet. Example: 15 minutes to get to the from of the queue on 3rd June 2014. The use of Cobus buses for boarding is fine for a Spanish holiday airport but in the UK it's no good. Example: on 6th May 2014 it took me 35 minutes from going through the gate to boarding EZY401 - mostly spent stood on a packed Cobus bus. With 5 minutes in steady rain after getting off the bus. Summary: Bristol has all the inefficiency of a small-town holiday airport with none of the charm.,1,0
bristol-airport,H Lawton,United Kingdom,I have concerns about the checking of luggage at this airport. Something in my hand baggage attracted the attention of the scanning official. My bag was searched and a can of deodorant confiscated because it was 150ml container. Rather petty but it was my I guess my fault. However he was so pleased with his discovery that he failed to detect other unseparated bottles of toiletries that I'd frankly forgotten about from a previous trip. He missed my partner's liquids completely. What is the point of the baggage search? It should be strictly security related not pedantic and cursory.,1,0
bristol-airport,J Thrush,United Kingdom,Flying from Bristol Airport and dressed smartly to meet our friends in Toulouse.

Soaked to the skin we had to endure the flight sat in our saturated clothes. No apology from the staff at the airport or from the cabin crew. I hope we never have to fly from Bristol Airport again when the weather is so unfriendly. I sought an apology from the company responsible for providing this appalling service but they appear to be totally uninterested in the customers comforts. I will avoid Bristol Airport whenever possible.,2,0
bristol-airport,P Spence,United Kingdom,Flew into Bristol Airport yesterday and had long walk to passport control interrupted by having to halt our progress while foot passengers boarding a flight were allowed to cross our path to get to their plane a bit 'tacky' in my opinion. Then the 'scrum' at passport control several queue lines which merge further on causing friction 3 control booth's unmanned non-eu passengers allowed to queue-jump after filling in a form. Most frustrating thing for many people holding the 'newer' chipped passports was the lack of guidance resulting in some travellers queuing for no reason. Passport control's shortcoming's reflect badly on Bristol airport.,1,0
bristol-airport,Philip O'Connor,United Kingdom,I'm surprised at the negative reviews. I hadn't used Bristol for over a year. I'm at the airport now waiting for my flight. It's a busy Friday late afternoon. Got through security in a couple of minutes seemed to be plenty of staff and the ones I dealt with were very friendly and informal.,9,1
bristol-airport,J Short,New Zealand,I am originally from Bristol so I really wanted an airport to be proud of. Alas the opposite is true. Security simply don't have enough people making the queues long and painful. An under pressure staff makes for a grumpy staff and there was no exception to the rule at Bristol Airport. Once inside I needed to use the toilets but not only are they hard to find when I did find them they were out of order or so dirty I refused to use them. On the return journey after a dash across a rain soaked runway we were greeted with customs and security queues as far as the eye could see. Overall a shocking experience and in the future I will avoid Bristol Airport at all costs.,,0
bristol-airport,Graham Fuller,United Kingdom,We flew from Bristol Airport on the afternoon of 15th March. Having been dreading the experience of security control I was amazed that the officials were positively affable! In view of many previous horrible experiences it was almost disconcerting. Everything else was alas the same. A very long walk from the main terminal to the departure gate arriving in time to see the easyJet crew arriving at the aircraft by bus. This said it all. I heard several passengers expressing their annoyance at this. Upon our return a week later another long walk including a flight of stairs.,,0
bristol-airport,T Appleton,United Kingdom,Flew out of the airport at the weekend again the security Jobsworth's were trying to justify their jobs with aggressive body searches. On return on Sunday pm we landed ahead of schedule at 16.45 and our luggage arrived in the terminal at 17.34 are Servisair not able to cope with early arrivals on a quiet Sunday afternoon? Also the Bus from the plane waited outside the terminal entrance for 5 minutes as there was nobody available to open the entry door! I use the airport around a dozen times airport and it's still a provincial airport pretending to be an international airport.,2,0
bristol-airport,P Hancock,United Kingdom,Chequer cars have airport monopoly on taxi services. The front apron removed to limit public access. A new drop and collection point once a free area for 10 minutes now charges also if over 20 minutes escalates to rip off level. How can people be expected to account for delays of aircraft while picking up? Double red lines on private property are policed by Avon and Somerset also used as airport security would it not be better to allow the Airport to employ mercenaries saving tax payers money using officers on a private land and letting custom officers have more responsibility.,,0
bristol-airport,Catherine Bailey,United Kingdom,The experience walking along endless corridors with steps and uphill ramps was the most painful travel experience of my life. I have knee problems which are very painful when walking long distances. I do not use a wheelchair but walk at a slow pace but when proceeding to the departure gate I would have missed my flight if my partner had not taken me part of the way in a wheelchair. You cannot imagine the feeling of distress when experiencing this - never ever again will I travel from Bristol.,,0
bristol-airport,S Thomas,United Kingdom,Nothing good at all about Bristol Airport now - how they can transform it into the most painful experience from 10 years ago goodness knows - hate using it we but we have to use it at least 6 times a year as we have no alternative.,,0
bristol-airport,Roberta Leddy,France,As this was the first occasion I had encountered the 'new' passport arrangements the female security officer with whom I had the misfortune to have guide' me through the procedure was very unpleasant and officious and showed huge irritation and more than a lack of patience (which was evident in her tone of voice and body language) thereby I found her to be extremely rude and rather offensive. Very disappointing to have to complain but the experience left me feeling frustrated annoyed and very dispirited is this really the impression you want to convey to both British and overseas visitors! If one is polite then you expect the same in return! If I had not been tired and just wanting to get to Bath then I would have complained in person - but then again I surely should not have reason if the member of staff had behaved in a more professional manner.,2,0
bristol-airport,Stuart Adair,United Kingdom,Departed from Palma airport which has escalators everywhere and spotlessly clean toilets every 100 yds. Arrived in Bristol to what felt like a 5 mile hike to get to the baggage collection. There was one single gents toilet en- route toilet paper all over the floor and no water working to wash your hands. Despite the lengthy delay in actually getting to baggage collection we still had a 15 minute wait before the belt started. I can't see any reason to choose to fly from here again would rather drive to Birmingham.,2,0
bristol-airport,Lorraine Lawrence,United Kingdom,"Appalling for people to have to traipse such a long way from plane to terminal building. No escalators/moving walkways but lots of stairs. Always lengthy passport control queues. What really gets my goat is the fact that you have to pay to drop off/pick up as well. If it is to be known as an ""International Airport"" then it really needs to buck up its ideas.",3,0
bristol-airport,Shaun Walker,United Kingdom,Security self scan gates don't work properly. The security Staff seem undertrained and customer service was something to be desired. Not a good experience.,,0
bristol-airport,Mike Price,United Kingdom,Used the airport twice within the last 6 months. Worst experience ever on both occasions it involved a quarter of a mile walk to board the plane. Same on return journey. Never used to be like this whoever designed the new terminal should be sacked no horizontal escalators I can't imagine how old people cope.,2,0
bristol-airport,N McCrae,United Kingdom,Bristol is a functional regional airport. It operates on the same economic model as low cost carriers. If you want a service such as a trolley you pay for it. In the same way that if you want to put your bag in the hold you pay for it. I have travelled through Bristol countless times over recent years and have always found it to be efficient and comfortable. Yes at peak times in the mornings the terminal can become crowded and that can be a pain but again if it troubles you that much you can pay to go into the Aspire lounge. I wonder how many of the moaning commenter's have extensive travel experience? Some of the walk times at Heathrow and Gatwick are far longer than the 5 minute walk from the west apron and all airports charge for drop off now. What service do people expect if they've paid Â£45 to fly to Europe? If the airline is charging that; what cut do you think the airport is getting? Ryanair pays the airport virtually nothing in landing fees. That's why they make up revenue elsewhere. You get what you pay for. You aren't going to have a world class airport like Changi or Dubai when it is only served by low cost airlines. If you want luxury fly business from Heathrow but then again you will have to pay a premium for it! I think we are lucky to have a local airport with so many connections cities like Cardiff would kill for the network Bristol has.,8,1
bristol-airport,Peter Cullen,United Kingdom,After my review in July I flew four more times to or from Bristol in the summer each time the flight departed from or arrived at a gate on the western apron necessitating at 350+ metre walk meanwhile every aircraft parking spot in front of or adjacent to the terminal building was empty. I sent an email to the airport politely asking why this happens as it seems inefficient on a number of levels and inconveniences passengers for no apparent reason. Two weeks have passed and no reply I assume there is no rational explanation. It also indicates the indifference with which the airport's management appear to regard their customers. For all this I am not entirely negative about the airport I have never encountered rude staff at security or border control as mentioned by others some appear rather bored and disinterested but to be honest it is not the most exciting job however they have always been polite. My opinion remains that Bristol is an acceptable airport let down by poor management whose only interest is maximising revenue at any cost.,5,1
bristol-airport,Robert Nash,United Kingdom,This is my local airport and I am ashamed of it. The latest changes have made the travel experience worse. You start off with a crowded drop off point that also doubles as a collection point and it just leads to chaos. The drop off point should be near the departure zone as most people being dropped off are going to catch a flight. You then start the first long trek with your luggage and perhaps children. If your unlucky your operator (Thomson) has a sign at the check in desk stating all flights which will then guarantee you standing watching people queue jump as their flight is boarding before yours (we stood for 45 mins watching this). Then you negotiate the security section which can either be straight forward or another stressful windup. I managed to get my belt camera wallet coat keys and travel bag back pretty quick but I was puzzled where my shoes went. I stood waiting for 5 minutes and they just disappeared whilst even more people passed through. The next windup came as we had to walk through duty free shops and stalls which seem to be taking over where there used to be more seating and refreshment area. We had booked to wait in the Service Air lounge which had now been relocated since last year. Another disaster but I will take that up with them. Now this is where it gets stupid. Your gate is announced on the departure screen and you could start one the longest walks of you life in a small airport. We walked for ages along an upper corridor to find the gate. We then negotiated about 30 steps to a holding area which was packed with our fellow Thomson 757 passengers (about 233 people). So this whole new building protect left us walking along distance negotiating stairs and still walking out over the airport apron to queue in the elements onto the steps of the plane. The return flight was just a rerun of the out bound experience. Out of the plane down the steps into the rain the walk across the apron up the 30 steeps and the walk that felt I was going suddenly to appear at Bristol City center. I really felt for those fellow passengers who had any difficulty walking or those with young children (as you hand in your pushchair and don't get it back until luggage reclaim). Judging by the other passengers £2 to hire a luggage trolley must be a joke as they were more than likely free where you flew out of your departure airport. Air travel is supposed to become better! Come on Bristol start thinking about your customers and get it right!,,0
bristol-airport,Mark Thomas,United Kingdom,"A place where the customer is simply gouged! Extremely poor access - small roads and no motorway access. Rip off car parking prices where your car is parked in badly lit and sign-posted areas. In the terminal you are again expected to stand around as the place when busy has hardly any public seating as it has been given over to Duty Free and other retailers who are allowed to charge what they want. Plus who else puts a large Starbucks in the middle of the concourse and builds a new gate system that is about a quarter of a mile long with no traveling escalator. It is dreadful when you see elderly people struggling after a long flight to walk all that way. As other people have commented many of the security and staff have a real ""job's worth"" attitude towards the people who ultimately pay their salaries - the customer - I find they are often the most officious of airport staff I have come across and I travel a lot around the world. The passport arrangements are regularly farcical as the queues build - absolutely no chance they will take away some retail space to provide more space for the paying customers.",3,0
bristol-airport,Paul Higgins,United Kingdom,I fly a lot and flip between LHR and BRS. I've used BRS quite a few times in the recent weeks using both low cost and national carriers. Car parking costs are in line with other airports security no issue (I was expecting a long delay for a midweek 06.30 flight but was through in no time at all). I have never found security staff anything other than pleasant and professional. Returning - again no issues through passport control there was a queue all desks were staffed and the queue kept moving. It compares more than favourably with other regional airports across Europe. I'd like to make an observation on other largely negative comments about walking time to gates and irritating charges for trolleys and car pick up. Probably 80% of the airports landing fees revenue is from low cost carriers who are not prepared to pay for frills including moving walkways and air bridges. Even at airports with these facilities the likes of Easyjet and Ryanair end up in a basic terminal and/or one far away from the main entrance and when you get to the gate you can still be bussed to the plane. Don't blame the airport for providing only what the majority of their carriers are prepared to pay for.,10,1
bristol-airport,J Denning,United Kingdom,For a small regional airport has a surprisingly modern spacious terminal. Big enough to provide decent facilities while still retaining the small quick and relatively painless experience of a small airport (any airport these days involves some element of hassle!). The gate was a fair walk but no worse than most airports and the flight was called in plenty of time to get to the gate without feeling rushed. Process on return was just as good - 20 mins from touchdown to being in my car having collected my baggage is pretty good.,9,1
bristol-airport,G Santinni,United Kingdom,Worst airport on the planet by a mile. Extreme charges to drop people off rip off charge for trolleys been to 8 different airports this year and this is the only one with a trolley charge. Security takes an age I was clean shaven when I joined the queue and had grown a beard by the time I was clear. Very long walk to gates for elderly and young children. Flights are expensive compared to other UK airports. I use as a last resort and I'm local.,,0
bristol-airport,Stuart Barman,United Kingdom,Expensive taxi journey to get to the airport. Only the airport taxi service is allowed to drop you off near the airport. Drop off and pick up costs £1 each time. Rip off trolley charge to take your bags 30 yards from the drop off point. If you use the airport parking this is more expensive than many of the flights. Long queue to get past security. Staff are rude. Once inside there is nowhere to sit. The departure gates are next to the shops you cannot get to the shops as they are blocked by people queuing to depart. There are only about 3 places to eat. LDeparture gates are miles away so once you have cleared the security checks you have to run to catch the plane! Once you have reached the departure gate it is handily down a flight of stairs so you have to struggle with your cases and prams down a cramped staircase. Once in the departure lounge there are approximately 20 seats for 150 people. Returning to Bristol is a horrendous experience. You will be dropped miles from security. People will be running for the exit to try and beat the queue! The final security gates are a nightmare. When you finally clear security and get your bags you will arrive in the airport foyer which is tiny and cramped. If you have forgotten to book a taxi you must then join another queue. The taxi then joins the rush hour traffic. Avoid if possible.,,0
bristol-airport,G Fuller,United Kingdom,Security and walking distances to departure gates are unacceptable. They reflect a business which is run entirely on the basis of making money. Similar comment can be made of charging for airport trolleys and for picking up and dropping off.,,0
bristol-airport,T Sochanik,United Kingdom,Pick up and drop off are a nightmare. You have to use their (chargeable) drop-off parking. Short stay parking - what a rip-off. Flight £40 (to Poland) Parking £60 - Bizarre - how much does a piece of Tarmac really cost? On arrival (from Crete) - yes have used this airport more than once - we had to walk what seemed like miles. A travelling floor might have helped those less able citizens who found it a struggle! I'm sure Bristol could do better!,4,1
bristol-airport,S Clare,United Kingdom,I use BRS several times a year and it's fine. Security on the way out generally takes no longer than other airports and baggage delivery on arrival is usually pretty timely. I'd have to agree with an earlier comment regarding use of stands aircraft seem to park past unused stands quite regularly and I grapple to see the logistical reasoning behind this. However on another comment (posted today) you'd struggle to pay £27 for parking and even so why would anyone living 10 minutes away from the airport choose not to get a taxi?,7,1
bristol-airport,A Pittman,United Kingdom,Same comments as most on here -it's a disgrace. We only use it because we're only 10mins away. They've moved the free pickup and drop off point from adjacent to the terminal to 1/4 mile away down a steep hill so they can now charge for the former one. If you want to get through security in less than half an hour you have to pay extra for that too. They've taken out seats in the departure area to turn the space into a shopping mall so you have to stand waiting for your flight to be called. You then have to walk up to 1/4 mile to a gate with no escaltors/travelators and then stand for around 20mins in an area where there are 20 seats for aircraft carrying upwards of 150 passengers. The car parking charges are outrageous-we were recently charged £27 for a day and then had a credit card surcharge slapped on top of that with no warning.,,0
bristol-airport,P Cullen,United Kingdom,I have used Bristol 6 times at various times of the day in the last few weeks. Departures have generally been quite good with queues for security no more than 5 minutes seating can be crowded particularly early morning but there were always some places. Flights particularly from the western apron are called early. Arrivals were not so good but just acceptable the passport readers were working but very slow - at least once it would have been quicker to queue to see an officer. My main gripe is the misuse of resources my last arrival was typical: the aircraft was parked at the far end of the western apron giving us a 400+m walk to the terminal building (they do at least advertise the distance). As we walked along we saw at least a dozen aircraft parking spaces closer (including 3 in right front of the terminal) none of which was being used. Surely a more efficient use of space that would make customers' lives easier is a relatively easy thing for management to achieve? Also why do you have show your boarding pass to buy a newspaper? WH Smith if you want reduce the queue just be sensible.,5,1
bristol-airport,C Sparks,United Kingdom,"We live 10 minutes from the airport so try and use it when we go away on holiday/business. I also have to pick up people frequently. Here are my issues: 1. The free short stay parking is at the far side of the airport forcing you to pay for up to 20 mins drop off/pick up. 2. Pay for a trolley. 3. Insufficient security staff at busy times. We've waited 45 minutes at times. 4. No water fountains. They want you to pay £1.50 for a bottle of water when you come through to the baggage reclaim area after a flight. 5. The final straw was this morning. We arrived at 5am after a flight from Florida. Our airplane ""parked"" at the furthest gate possible from the baggage reclaim/customers so we had a long walk and most people had young and very tired children. We cleared customers swiftly but then were told that for operational reasons we'd have to wait 30 minutes to receive our baggage. 6. On top of this next year Thomson will no longer be flying from Bristol to Sanford (Florida) because Bristol Airport charges them too much.",1,0
bristol-airport,H Ruddle,United Kingdom,"Normally okish but yesterday was a shambles at security 40 mins to get through people in danger of missing flights etc. Problem seemed to be a scanner out of order but the staff did nothing to reorganise the queues or inform passengers just left the affected very long queue standing there in ignorance. And when it was pointed out to staff that people were in danger of missing flights the response was a shrug and ""well you should have got here earlier then"". Dreadful customer service and attitude. Also parking charges are a rip off short term is Â£ £3.50 up to an hour or £6.50 if you stay 1-2 hours easily done when meeting someone. Or £1 just to drive through.",2,0
bristol-airport,K Jones,United Kingdom,It's a disgrace to charge for dropping off - often you're not even going to be there long enough to switch the engine off. Rightly or wrongly I pulled up to drop my sister off just before the drop off zone - no double yellow lines no signs to say you couldn't pull over there and I wasn't causing any obstruction. Having dropped her off I thought I'd take the opportunity to remove my coat before continuing on my way. Suddenly there's a loud rapping on my window and an official shouting at me 'Move'. Surprised by his aggression I said I was about to leave. His reply: 'Move now'. Most unpleasant. The police don't speak to people like that and neither should jobsworth airport officials.,,0
bristol-airport,D Hubbocks,Spain,I have noted other negative comments about this airport and agree my review is about the manner we were screened during the security process. We are both older people my wife having undergone a knee replacement needing the continual use of a walking stick. My wife went through the scanner and as usual it reacted. I can describe it no less than they pounced on her demanding that she go through a thorough security check she was treated without due concern for her condition and kept standing unaided for more than 20 minutes - her requests for the return of her walking stick were refused continually being told this was 'Procedure'. I went through and I had forgotten a small magnetic glasses holder in my waistcoat pocket and the scanner reacted to that. My belongings were searched I became extremely unhappy at the way he was conducting himself. We were treated from the start as though we had done something criminal that we were guilty of something. We both totally understand the need for security we would be foolish to suggest otherwise it was how the staff applied the security measures that is at fault. We have passed through innumerable airports in our lifetime never have we been subjected to such 'jobsworth' attitudes and a lack of respect and empathy shown towards older people. I doubt we will ever fly via Bristol again.,3,0
bristol-airport,Michael Dickinson,United Kingdom,Bristol Airport has been a wonderful friendly easy to use and cheap airport. Why on earth has the practice been introduced of charging £2 for the use of a trolley? Especially as the drop-and-go car park has been re- sited so far from the terminal building that anyone being dropped by car with for example children and luggage not an unusual set of circumstances will need two trolleys. Bear in mind that for some travellers a private car remains the only way they can get to the airport economically.,5,0
bristol-airport,C Hart,United Kingdom,No free passenger drop-off area. Cost me £1 for less than one minutes parking didn't even switch off the engine. Passenger pick-up was worse. By my watch I was still inside the 20 minute window but was charged £3 at the barrier. That's £3 for 20 minutes parking! No free luggage trolleys. This airport fleeces the traveller at every opportunity. Returning to Bristol from foreign airports which are efficiently run and who try to provide a service to their customers is embarrassing.,3,0
bristol-airport,P Cullen,United Kingdom,Departed mid morning on a weekday and returned Sunday afternoon both painless with nothing really to criticise all systems functioned quickly and efficiently. As a regular user it is clear that the number of flights from Bristol this winter is down on previous years and the summer months and while I am sure the airport's management are concerned it has benefits for passengers - queues are short and facilities adequate. There is still the long trek to/from the western departure gates but on this occasion I was lucky our aircraft was close to the terminal.,8,1
bristol-airport,J Taylor,United Kingdom,Flying from Bristol to Tenerife we had a late morning flight check in was a bit busy but got through quickly check in desk staff were friendly and security staff were also very nice duty free was busy but had good facilities (needs to be extended.) A long walk to gate and was very busy but flight staff were polite. I will look forward to flying from Bristol soon.,8,1
bristol-airport,S Oxley,United Kingdom,Bristol is my local airport and I like it very much. If you want a good long walk ridiculous waits and rude staff try Paris or Geneva. If you want lack of seats basic amenities and rude staff try Spain Barbados or Acapulco. Bristol is a lovely airport with little wrong with it. I make a point of travelling Easyjet when I can.,9,1
bristol-airport,G Brownlie,United Kingdom,One pound charge for drop off is unacceptable. Non-refundable two pound charge for use of a trolley is theft. Lack of seating and restricted room when removing and donning items of clothing is unacceptable. There must be some way that consumers can fight back against this treatment that we as customers remember have to endure. Maybe we need more airports to create real competition.,,0
bristol-airport,P Higgins,United Kingdom,Travelled to airport using public transport for midweek morning flight. Arrived at terminal 7:30 am. There were no hold ups on the road. I used online check-in so went straight to security. Absolutely no queues at security. Returned on Friday evening only one person in front of me at passport control all scanners and manual checking stations were open and working. Using only hand baggage no further delays and used taxi to get home. All in all both ends of the trip couldn't have been better.,10,1
bristol-airport,P Higgins,United Kingdom,I travelled to the airport by train/bus. Everything was on time and the bus dropped me off directly outside the terminal entrance. Travelling on early after noon flight there were very short queues at security the security staff were positively friendly and helpful and guided me to the shortest x-ray line. Bristol compares very favourably and in many cases has far more facilities with many of the other regional airports I've visited in other European countries. I downgraded the faculties based on seating arrangements which are not ideal (sat in corridors effectively) but again these compare favourably with other regional airports. I have an early morning flight in 2 weeks.. It will be interesting to compare experiences.,8,1
bristol-airport,N Tregoning,United Kingdom,Once again I subjected myself to the most charmless security staff on the planet. I have used this airport on numerous occasions and the staff are dreadful - rude non communicative and surly. I was summoned by the beckoning finger for frisking and the lady who performed the operation said not one word and had a surly face. She took my shoes and after frisking I had no idea where they had gone. Despite loudly asking my husband where they were no one offered one iota or help or advice. Luckily my husband had seen them reappear. I claimed them and we beat a hasty retreat. If anyone from Bristol Airport reads this I would suggest you invest in some customer relations training for your staff as must of them seem to have had a charisma bypass. I will not use this airport again unless there is no other option.,2,0
bristol-airport,C O'Neill,United Kingdom,I found this to be a pretty ok airport all around. It felt open clean and accessible as a place to be utilised. I used it last year when travelling to Glastonbury. The process from start to finish was all matter of fact and done with flowing efficiency. When we spent most time there (returning home) it was a quiet time on a Sunday evening so I'm not sure how they cope during busier times. Almost too much so at times we were wafted through without the usual glare of strict attention that you get when travelling through airport security. Airside there is a good range of shops and places to eat that despite the quietness of the airport were all open and offering their full range of services. So overall a good experience the relaxed atmosphere which as I say may have been specific to the time of our visit was great but could appear to cross into indifference or apathy if not careful.,9,1
bristol-airport,Kevin Tozer,United Kingdom,This is a functional airport but such poor service leaves a very sour taste. £2 for a trolley who needs them families and the elderly precisely who can't afford them. No longer allowed to check bag weight at the check- in now required to pay £1 per bag to check its weight. £1 for clear plastic bags they do not like you to use your own. £1 minimum charge to drop off or pick up although they have been so generous they have a 10 minute free car park but where is this mysterious car-park? It's a 10 minute walk from the terminal! I've written a letter of complaint about the parking charges only to be told other airports are doing it so that's ok! Why can they not give 20 minutes free and charge after? So many more people are just dropping off on the road outside and blocking the flow of traffic which I would now heartily recommend.,2,0
bristol-airport,J Patience,France,Travelled to France with elderly friend who had reduced mobility. We booked special assistance and it was indeed special kind efficient and well organised service. So different from my last experience at this airport with my grandson.,8,1
bristol-airport,J Patience,France,Last year I travelled from Bristol airport with my 5 year old grandson. Unknown to me he had added a pair of flimsy toy handcuffs - his latest and favorite toy. The woman in charge of the security x-ray machine opened his hand luggage and promptly took the handcuffs. My grandson burst into tears and was inconsolable. She gave him no explanation no apology for taking his toy showed no compassion and continued with her job much to the distress of other security staff and passengers. I complained to the airport authority who apologised but did not replace the toy.,3,0
bristol-airport,K Painter,Czech Republic,So once again my annual trip to visit my family. I arrived from Prague at about 23.30 and we were bussed to the arrivals area. I was quite amazed as the machines were working and I was able to clear customs in a few minutes. My sister picked me up – she still had to pay a pound for driving into the pick up / drop off area where I jumped into the car and we were away in two minutes. Return trip was not as enjoyable. I had bought some small items for my car and let the check in guy know that I wanted to go to the separate scanner just in case there were any problems. He misunderstood my English and proceeded to put a red “firearms” tag on my suitcase. I explained to the officer and once again he had real difficulty understanding me. So now the rush to the loading gate a complete nightmare I am not “disabled” but have great difficulty walking any more than 100 metres without being able to sit down and have a rest for a minute. The sign telling me that I had only 300+ metres to go didn't help at all and by the time I reached the top of those steep stairs down to the loading gate I was in agony. Until they do something about this I will down mark this airport.,3,0
bristol-airport,Eric Porter,United Kingdom,A regular user of this airport flying to Dublin and Edinburgh to visit family with our 1 year old Son. Can only echo what other have said re: Drop off parking charges trolley charges Long term parking prices and poor gate facilities. My partner has travelled alone with our son and she has arrived many times juggling a baby a buggy a suitcase and cabin baggage only to find she has to pay £2 for a trolley to get the 20 yards or so to where I am waiting and can carry bags. This non refundable fee is taking full advantage of elderly less able passengers especially those travelling with children and especially pregnant women travelling alone. It is cynical profiteering to prey on these people who have no choice but to use a trolley.,2,0
bristol-airport,Roy Carpenter,Portugal,I am a frequent user of Bristol airport and some things have improved and some worsened over the past year. Car hire is a nightmare with the reception being a long walk without cover from the terminal and the car return is now about 100 yards from reception. I queried this with Hertz and they apologised saying it was an airport authority ruling about which they were not happy. Security is now vastly improved with friendly staff and more machines with an impression of thoroughness (they always query and thoroughly check my medical equipment). This last time I used the Executive Lounge and although the snacks are minimal there is a reasonable selection of alcoholic non-alcoholic hot and cold drinks. A receptionist who noticing that I was limping escorted me the quickest way to the boarding gate took me to the head of the queue and notified Ryanair staff of my problem. They also were very considerate and allowed me to sit in one of the 'keep empty' rows so I could put my leg up en route.,7,1
bristol-airport,K Edward,United Kingdom,The entire thing is a farce from start to finish firstly the parking charges for a short stay. Security is a total joke. Travelling with 2 small children I had to scan the boarding passes for each person separately and walk through separately waiting each time for the gate to close and scan the next pass with 3 bags of hand luggage and 2 kids it would have been nice for the staff member who simply stared blankly at the obvious drama unfolding. Once at security they only had one scanning machine running and wanted me to walk through leaving my items in the belt to go through anyone should understand this is totally unacceptable as leaving my now unscanned mobile phone wallet keys laptop bag next to unknown people who could tamper with them. Once my bag went through they pulled everything out of it and swabbed it all with some sort of device and never explained what was going on just asked me to open each compartment of the bag. Delayed me by 30 minutes no apology or explanation. Will never use this airport again just isn't worth the hassle.,1,0
bristol-airport,Oliver Thomas,United Kingdom,About 8 miles outside Bristol only accessible via a network of A roads and country lanes. No motorway access or train station and only a very poor (and expensive) bus from the centre of Bristol. Add to that expensive parking with an unreliable shuttle bus and you have the perfect recipe for a stressful journey just getting to the airport. Unfortunately the stress does not stop when you arrive: The terminal building is poorly designed with lots of narrow and steep steps to negotiate for elderly and disabled people or (like us) families with young children. Customs queues (on arrival) are always very long and slow and over-fastidious (Why do you need to give everyone the 3rd degree for an internal EU flight). You have to pay £2 for a baggage trolley (not refunded). I've flown many times from this airport and not once have I been even remotely satisfied with any aspect of the experience. As a Bristolian and after having extensive experience of other European airports both large and small I am ashamed that this airport is the first experience of the UK and Bristol that many foreign visitors have to endure. It is high time the airport operator and the local authority got their act together updated the terminal built a dedicated motorway junction on the M5 and maybe even a dedicated rail link while they're at it. Bristol is a major UK city and it deserves better.,1,0
bristol-airport,Peter Cullen,United Kingdom,An early morning departure was not as bad as I had feared; security queues were short and staff helpful - ten minutes from parking my car to sitting in the departure lounge. Seating was adequate when I arrived but not about 15 minutes later. Arriving late afternoon was very easy with no queues at immigration. I recognise some of the complaints from others are valid I heard several people complaining about the £2 charge to use a baggage trolley and sympathise (fortunately I had hand luggage only). Yes you do have to go through the 'Duty Free' shop after security (as in many other airports) but you do not have to stop - I never do. As a regular user I feel that Bristol is slowly improving (as it needed to).,8,1
bristol-airport,T Ingleton,United Kingdom,The great thing about Bristol airport? It's local saving a long trip. Also the range of destinations isn't bad. But parking is expensive security queues are often so bad people are forced to pay for 'fast track security'. Far too many narrow stairs for families and the elderly or infirm to negotiate. Forced to walk through a large shop to get to the departure lounge (I wonder why). The lounge is very cramped and crowded - there is seating away from the main lounge but most people don't know or don't want to risk being in the wrong place when their gate is announced. Why are the queues so bad for check-in security and passports? The airport knows what planes are scheduled and how big the planes are and could plan properly. It just looks like everything was thrown together in a hurry. As for bussing when there are free stands you could walk to - what's that all about?,3,0
bristol-airport,John Clift,United Kingdom,Senior airport management here should be told that a gormless security individual shouting useless instructions at the poor passengers trying to get through security is only making a rather tedious process even worse. Like all others commenting about the place its only saving grace is it is quicker to fly from here than Heathrow. Facilities are poor even on a Sunday morning after the early rush. Extortionate charges for everything in the place. And yes those use less biometric passport readers never work as they are hardly open and when they are a dismal failure. An awful all round experience.,1,0
bristol-airport,L Roberts,United Kingdom,I live in Bristol and my husband and I travel a lot. Yesterday I dropped my husband off at the 'drop off zone' only to find that we now have to pay £1 for the privilege. The sign at the entrance doesn't tell you you have to pay it simply says something like the area is operated by barriers. Bristol airport please take note that in other airports in other parts of the world you can drop off for free baggage carts are free wifi is free and there are even showers.,2,0
bristol-airport,Robin Marshall,France,I wonder if Bristol airport management fully appreciate the contempt that I and many other passengers have felt after using them for the first (and definitely last) time. They charge £2 un-refundable for a trolley. The £2 becomes a tax on being elderly or disabled and that for me encapsulates everything about Bristol airport. I had to pay £1 to get my rental car out of the forecourt and another £1 to get back in. I don't think I am fussy I just don't like being taken for the sort of idiot who will pay for a scam and come again.,2,0
bristol-airport,P Gibson,United Kingdom,I refuse to use Bristol airport any more - unless I have absolutely no alternative. I used to fly out of there and route through Amsterdam but I now prefer to travel to Heathrow and I fly very frequently. There are numerous areas of concern but I think that the award for the rudest security staff has found it's home here. Other than that expensive parking lack of seating bussing (or walking forever) to get on a plane and the fact that just can't cope with their own expansion is more than enough to say here. One of the worst airports I have ever used.,2,0
bristol-airport,C Aldam,United Kingdom,Drop Off fee outrageous. It used to be so easy. Staff friendly apart from the amazingly unhelpful security (twice experienced this now). With 2 young children by myself I was given no help. I caused long queues behind me as they wanted all shoes off all of us everything explored pushchair and material baby rucksack bag tested toothpaste's calpol. Only curt rudeness shown to me all of this time. On returning got help from fellow passengers for all the stairs who routinely see those with children having problems with no staff helping out. This does not happen at other regional UK airports (friendly and helpful staff - even at the higher security risk airports). Makes me ashamed of my local airport.,2,0
bristol-airport,H Smith,United Kingdom,Drop off fee of £1 - this may well be discriminatory for people with a disability/mobility problem - what other choice do you have than to pay? My husband was told to remove his shoes at security he was not provided with nor offered a seat to do this - despite walking with obvious difficulty and using a walking stick. A female member of staff treated us with total disregard and lack of respect - she prevented me from going back through the scanner to assist my husband. When I approached a Manger he apologised said he would look in to it and told us my husband should not have been asked to remove his shoes in an area without seating. Went to food service area - tables not cleared of prior occupants' debris. Then we were faced with appallingly long queues at boarding areas - so bad that we couldn't get out of lift without a struggle to get through crowds. Would not use this airport again through choice.,1,0
bristol-airport,Peter Cullen,United Kingdom,Some complaints are being addressed others persist. Leaving late morning was fairly comfortable - short queues and plenty of seating; arriving early evening likewise (passport readers were working for the first time in my experience). There is still the very long walk to the western departure gates that many have mentioned and why was our aircraft parked remotely with passengers bussed to the terminal when there were half a dozen unoccupied parking spots next to the terminal? The long stay car park is convenient (2 minutes walk from the terminal) though expensive.,6,1
bristol-airport,M Byatt,Spain,Although not happy with the pound charge to drop off and pick up it is far better than the rip off charge levied at Bournemouth. I visit the UK around 6 times a years and have boycotted Bournemouth following their robbery. Here in Tenerife at our local airport parking for a pick up is free for the first 30 minutes. After that the charges are very low. It actually encourages rather than deters the customers. Most folks working there are polite but sadly there are still a few rude nasty and ill mannered among them.,5,0
bristol-airport,R Croker,United Kingdom,Bristol airport is a joke only not a funny one. From the moment you arrive you are ripped off for a drop off tax then there is the walk and god help you if you have small children pushchairs and hand luggage. After the hike to the boarding gate you are faced with a flight of stairs no lift or ramp available in what is supposed to be state of the art new extension. Landing is even worst with small children and pushchairs/hand luggage again your faced with a flight of stairs and after a long walk you have a choice to take a lift which holds 4 people or drag everything down the stairs. This is a truly terrible airport for families.,2,0
bristol-airport,S Twiggs,United Kingdom,I have just returned from a trip to Malaga with my 2 young children. On departure my gate was miles away down long corridors and when I eventually got to the gate I was met with stairs which I had to try and get my pushchair down with my 3 and 6 year old plus baggage. No ramp or lift to help me. Thankfully I had the help of another passenger. On my way back passengers disembarked onto the runway at around midnight we then had to walk to the terminal where once again more stairs greeted me without any ramp or lift. Not recommended.,1,0
bristol-airport,I Miller,United Kingdom,Difficult to travel to once off the motorway. The £1 to pay to drop off is outrageous and worst of all the security need to be taught some manners. How can you expect youngsters to be polite when you have such rude security staff?,4,0
bristol-airport,Victoria Baughen,United Kingdom,I have just missed my flight not realising this airport doesn't bother to announce boarding on all departures and that even if you arrive at the gate 15 minutes before the flight leaves the carrier can refuse to take you. I have flown from this airport for over 20 years and confirm what many other people say - that when it was small it was great but as it has grown it has got worse and worse with an enormous duty free area which serves as a passageway to the departure lounge and lots of other shops which have reduced the seats so much that you often have to buy a drink to find one. Ridiculously long walk to departure gates 12-16. Overall you'd think with all the money they're making they could afford a travelator.,3,0
bristol-airport,John Clift,United Kingdom,All of the unaware beware the car parking charges and all the other fees they charge here are an absolute rip off - with quite a few budget carriers their fares being less than three days parking. Even on a quite day the facilities are poor (who would have a notice up bragging that the hike to your gate is only X hundred metres?). The only reason I use the place is its location about 20 minutes door to door at 05.30 in the morning. Other than that its a place to avoid at all costs.,1,0
bristol-airport,J Leach,United Kingdom,Check-in and security was quick. Sunday evenings seem to be quiet. Drop off and car parking is a scandal. But by far the worst problem at Bristol is the long and bizarre walk to gate 11 and other new gates. We stood in a long wraparound style queue while we waited for our easyjet flight to disembark and prepare for us to embark (30 mins). There are no seats or toilets whatsoever in this small grey room. Easyjet staff are clearly up against it as they try to move us from one queue wrapping up and around a narrow staircase to another queue while cramming us in to this miserable room. Of all the airports I've been to in the world this was a new experience in shitty treatment. Previously a pleasant airport not any more.,1,0
bristol-airport,S Andrews,Belgium,"As a regular traveller through this airport I can but agree with the many negative comments on this website. I requested that a simple chair be provided before the x-ray arch so my shoes can be removed. I have a medical balance problem and standing and/or hopping on one leg is not possible. This results in me having to have a full body ""pat down"" every time I travel. It is embarrassing and causes unnecessary delay to other passengers. I wrote to the airport management making this request and received a reply saying this would be done immediately and that ""security"" had been informed. I travel on average every 2/3 weeks. Security staff are at best surly and unpleasant. The number of toilets in the main lounge are inadequate for the number of passengers. The recently introduced charges for my taxi using the ""drop off"" area and non-refundable baggage carts is yet more money grabbing wheezes at an airports whose charges are already amongst the highest in Europe.",1,0
bristol-airport,A Hartnell,United Kingdom,After using Bristol Airport for a number of years I would never entertain using Bristol Airport again. Recently when I got off the plane we walked over the tarmac to building entrance to be greeted by a large number of steps. There were two phones and two seats at the entrance but no notice or forewarning about the long walk - approximately half a mile - to get to passport control.,2,0
bristol-airport,A Matthews,United Kingdom,No relation to the A Matthews who reviewed below. I was hoping for things to have improved since I last used the airport about 4 times last year. Not a chance. My first gripe is the outrageous car parking charges. £38 for a long weekend in midwinter is a bit over the top. Secondly charging for a trolley is profiteering. Why doesn't the government do something about organisations ripping off captive customers. Thirdly in an attempt to lure passengers into buying something from the shops after going through security the owners have reduced to a minimum the area available to actually sit somewhere whilst waiting for your flight. Finally big queues for immigration. Why isn't this facility given a bigger room and more border control staff? Come on Bristol. I'm even considering travelling up the M4 to Heathrow now. You are getting no better.,2,0
bristol-airport,A Matthews,United Kingdom,I used to use Bristol airport 15 times a year before the re-vamp of the terminal with the duty free shop and western walkway - I now avoid it at all costs now it is so user unfriendly. The duty free shop is oversized there is simply no logic to the flow of passengers and dependent upon the gate allocated to you you may or may not be waiting on the right floor. If you are unfortunate to be using gates 14/15 be prepared for a very long and uncomfortable walk without travelators or escalators to negotiate the long distances and multiple steps and stairs. Arriving at these gates is equally unpleasant. Bristol has lost what it once had going for it when it was worth paying the overpriced car parking charges and baggage trolleys. There's simply no competition.,1,0
bristol-airport,Y Beames,United Kingdom,I used to use Bristol for around 6-8 return trips every year. This airport used to be a joy to use. My last 3 trips within the last 6 months have been awful. All the in-bounds took forever walking for miles then ages at passport control and finally over an hour to get suitcases that you can only put on over-priced trolleys. The outbound experiences differ. The first one involved a lengthy queue for passport control in the early hours of the morning. This spread all the way down the stairs into the main check-in area. After security I had to run to my gate whilst other people missed flights. The second time I was taking my daughter to Majorca and did not have any change for the chargeable drop off point. I had to get my partner to drop me off in the road. A 'jobs-worth' came up behind us in his 4x4 beeping and shouting and told us not to stop. Unfortunately the only way was to grab our suitcases from the car. On the way back my partner made sure he had some change but made a mistake of waiting up the road and watching our plane come in before he came to pick us up. It cost him £4.00 to get us out of the airport. Bristol Airport cannot cope with more than 4 flights in a day. I certainly will not be using this airport again if I can help it.,1,0
bristol-airport,S Coburn,United Kingdom,Why do they no longer offer a safe drop off facility? Instead you have to enter the short stay car park and pay £1 for the privilege! There are no signs to warn you that you will have to pay just to drop off before you enter. Several people who had obviously been stung by this before were dropping people off on the road the mini roundabout before the short stay car park the small junction at the exit to the short stay and even one family - on the main junction with the A38 at the entrance to the site. This is greed gone mad - dropping off is not parking. With no safe free drop off area its only a matter of time before there is an accident.,2,0
bristol-airport,Peter Cullen,United Kingdom,Bristol is my local airport and at last I feel I can say something positive about it. On departing this week it took 5 minutes from locking my car to sitting in the departure lounge I had pre-printed my boarding card but there were no queues and staff were cheerful. I also think they have increased the seating since my last visit there was plenty free. On arriving we were bussed to immigration but again no queue and I was driving out of the car park 20 minutes after landing. It was my best experience here for many years however there was still an absurdly early call to the gate - a 300 metre walk followed by 20 minutes standing staring at four grey walls. My flight left late morning when about 5 departures are scheduled in two hours and we arrived just ahead of the evening rush. It is clear that there are far fewer flights using Bristol this winter than in the summer or previous winters and at these traffic levels it copes well and is pleasant. I wonder what it is like leaving at 07.00 or arriving at 22.00 though I suspect some of the problems persist.,6,1
bristol-airport,Martin Walker,United Kingdom,I simply do not understand many of the previous negative comments. BRS is a small airport and it functions well. It's clean staff are helpful and friendly we don't have to walk miles and there's a smoking area airside. I have used this airport several times now and have no complaints.,9,1
bristol-airport,B Thomas,United Kingdom,A generally poor experience. How mean to charge for a 1 minute drop off and also for the use of a luggage trolley - what are foreign arrivals with no coins supposed to do? What kind of initial impression of Bristol does this give? The airport ethos seems to be to extract the maximum amount of cash from their customers with the least facilities eg seating made available.,1,0
bristol-airport,Edward Ciriello,United Kingdom,I only fly out of Bristol out of necessity. It used to be ok and fairly spacious but a revamp in the last few years has seen much of the seating airside cut and freezing cold rabbit warren gates to serve the low-cost airlines. At the same time they built a stupidly oversized shop that you must walk through to get to your gate which has also cut the amount of space for passengers. I wouldn't want to be stuck with a delay airside here as it could get quite claustrophobic. To cap it all off unless you drive out there you have no choice but to get the Bristol Flyer bus link - £10 return or £6 single. There is no other option and no competition for bus routes to the airport. On my recent visit passing through security was painless even if staff were a bit rude but I have faced long queues there at the weekends. I would fly from Cardiff if there were any airlines using it.,2,0
bristol-airport,A Martin,United Kingdom,Bristol is an awful airport. The airport is in a dreadful location being miles south-west of Bristol with no major roads nearby no train lines for miles and busses/coaches limited and expensive. The entire airport both the interior and exterior of the terminal building is a little dirty with the toilets being by far the worst. There is also a lack of shops food outlets restaurants and many other facilities both before and after security and nothing what so ever for arrivals. Queues are also on the slow side but not the worst I've experienced with check-in taking around 20 mins security is the worst at 30 mins and passport control normally takes between 10 and 15 mins. Baggage reclaim is ok taking not much more than 5 mins to arrive. Overall Bristol is a dreadful airport which guarantees to give you the most stressful and unpleasant journey.,1,0
bristol-airport,John Clift,United Kingdom,Long queues at check in / bag drop even longer queues for security and just as bad on return at passport control - do the biometric passport machines ever work? Long hike to the new gates and seating in the main terminal is woefully lacking. Staff in all areas surly and rude. All in all an airport to avoid if possible.,1,0
bristol-airport,S Evans,United Kingdom,Arrived for flight at 5.50am to find an enormous queue at the Ryanair check-in and almost as big a queue for security. Our flight was due to depart at 07.40 and we only just made it to the gate at 07.20. Fortunately we made our flight but it was an incredibly stressful experience. No time for a drink or breakfast as we had planned no idea what the facilities are like as we had to literally run though the terminal as we had been queuing for so long. On our return we had to catch the bus to the short stay car park and we yet again joined a queue which took almost 30 mins to get onto the bus. When we disembarked we had to join another queue to collect our car keys. In total it took an hour to get from the exit to our car. Not enough staff and too many flights departing at or around the same time and the car parking is a joke.,1,0
bristol-airport,Richard Campbell,United Kingdom,The queue just to get into the security area often stretches 50 yards and moves slowly. You can buy a fast track voucher for £5 but queues for this are getting longer and you need to allow 20 mins minimum even for fast track. Once into security the long queue moves slowly with unexplained hold ups. Security staff appear under considerable pressure and show this in the way they deal with passengers. There are very few seats in the main waiting area so much is given over to retail and often boarding queues stretch back into the waiting area. Some boarding gates are as much as 10 mins away even at a speedy pace. This airport which was once a pleasant departure point has now turned into a complete disaster.,1,0
bristol-airport,Alex McAllister,United Kingdom,It is terrible. High car parking charges inevitable queues at security. Insufficient seating in departure lounge. Incredibly long and arduous walk to the gates with no escalators or travelators but very short time to get to the gate after the announcement. All in all a very poor experience.,1,0
bristol-airport,Michel Fleuri,France,In spite of Bristol Airport being quite a new airport it is about the dirtiest airport I have had the displeasure of travelling through. The small amount of seating available in the departures terminal and departures “lounge” is all absolutely filthy. Far too filthy to sit on. The management seems only to be concerned with charging passengers at every opportunity - we are forced to pay for dropping off passengers in the short term drop off area then a £2 non-refundable charge to use a trolley then a small plastic bag in which to deposit our medication etc before passing through security. Please and thank you seem to be words missing in the vocabularies of most security operatives.,1,0
bristol-airport,K Painter,Czech Republic,We arrived expecting horrendous queues at passport control because of the Government workers strike but every desk was manned and people were smiling. We were bussed from the aircraft which made a huge difference to my experience I am not disabled but can only walk about 100metres without discomfort and can't stand up for very long. The officer even had a joke with me and the wait for luggage was reasonable however I think we were the only plane offloading. But once again my sister had to pay to pick us up. The return during the day was relatively painless check in (as usual with easyJet ) no problem security staff friendly the departures hall was very quiet so I was able to find a place to sit but I do hate that gaudy over-lit duty free shop just after security. We left from gate 1 so there were no endless corridors as in the last trip. But again my brother had to pay to drop us off. This is why I've marked it down again this year as I hate penny pinching and charging even a small amount for pick up and drop off is very mean.,3,0
bristol-airport,David Stringer,United Kingdom,The airport provides a free drop off point but it is half a kilometre from the terminal building. You can park for just 10 mins before a £4 fee kicks in. Otherwise dropping off (closer to the terminal building) for just one minute costs £1 (21mins to 30 mins costs £4). The terminal building has a long frontage which is for buses and taxis only - private cars cannot stop anywhere for free - other than as mentioned above. This is a cynical exercise in the exploitation of a captive audience. Regulatory authorities should act quickly to re-instate free drop-off parking (if only for 5 mins) close to the departure area.,4,0
bristol-airport,M Green,United Kingdom,At Bristol you are now unable to drop a person off without it costing £1. The walk to the departure gates especially the furthest gate is completely unacceptable. You will spend an age trying to get to passport control if more than 1 flight lands even queuing on stairs to find the new passport chip machines don't work. And I'm told on good authority that there isn't enough seating by far because people spend money if they cant sit down.,1,0
bristol-airport,P Stevens,United Kingdom,This is a handy local airport. There are sufficient shops and its always clean. Have found security fast and the airport itself is easy to get around. An added bonus it has a smoking area once you are through security. As a resident of the south west its usually the most economical and best airport for me to fly from.,5,0
bristol-airport,G Jones,United Kingdom,I've used Bristol Airport for many years and have never found cause for serious complaints. My wife and I recently flew from the airport at Saturday lunchtime a very busy period in summer. We paid £29.99 for 8 day's parking in the long stay admittedly a promotional offer but open to anyone. We were through security in 3 or 4 mins (about six or seven security stations open) and found strolling to the far end of the western walkway no problem at all and we are both in our late sixties. Before that we enjoyed an inexpensive lunch and wine (admittedly again on promotional offers open to anyone) at one of the eateries. We returned a week later on a Saturday at teatime and were one of six international flights 150-seat plus sized aircraft to have landed in a twenty minute period. Everyone to whom we spoke was polite which is our usual experience at Bristol (with the very occasional exception down the years) perhaps because we are always polite to them and try to co-operate with all requests. We were driving out of the car park within thirty minutes of our landing wheels touching the runway. Bristol is an excellent facility with an extensive range of UK European and North African destinations. Looking forward to the major expansion which will double the size of the terminal.,5,0
bristol-airport,A Alexander,United Kingdom,It has got worse and worse. Undermanned security. Extended shopping and reduced seating (200+ people forced to stand on my last visit). Last minute calls to the Gates which are a mile away with no escalators or travelators. Safety hazards caused by enormous queues on staircases. Extortionate pickup car park. All in all a thoroughly lousy experience!,1,0
bristol-airport,D Smith,United Kingdom,I do everything I can not to fly from Bristol Airport. I'd much rather go to Heathrow despite it being further away and much bigger and busier. I find the staff at Bristol off-hand and offensive transport links woefully inadequate parking extortionate and facilities poor. You no longer even get through immigration quickly as the last couple of times I've been there the queues have been long and slow-moving.,1,0
bristol-airport,Ian Arnold,United Kingdom,Arrived at BRS from TFS and couldn't believe the hike from aircraft to Immigration/Baggage. It's not even a level walk with stairs/escalators/lifts all playing their part. Immigration relatively painless but it took 33 minutes for any bag to appear onto the belt and 45 minutes for mine. Very quick to get from Customs to the bus to the city centre but they need to get their act together re baggage and walking distances.,2,0
bristol-airport,John Clift,United Kingdom,Pouring rain and the usual long haul trek from the apron to the baggage claim area even the nearest new gate is a good 250 metres hike. Passport control is more like entering a third airport and why are they so chummy taking the piss really. Baggage as usual you wait an age. The on site car park is a rip off for what is really a rubble strewn bit of ground prepay ticket would not operate exit barrier (but they took money on booking though). Overall a place to avoid if at all possible.,1,0
bristol-airport,John Matthews,Ireland,Arrivals was swift and seamless but departures is a completely different story. It's a fairly inoffensive place before you go through security and it's here that the ordeal really begins. We travelled in the afternoon and the security screening struck me as a pretty stressful affair with too many screening desks crammed into too small a space. This lack of space didn't afford any opportunity to get yourself together after going through security and passengers are immediately greeted by the duty free shop once screened. The experience is all about shopping to the detriment of facilitating a smooth transition through the airport and towards your gate. The area beyond the duty free shop is occupied by more shops and both space and seating is limited unless you're willing to fork out money in one of the many restaurants and coffee shops that come with ample seating. Most frustratingly of all the gates aren't announced until the last minute so there is no alternative but to wait in this money trap. Progression towards your flight involves a lot of queuing down corridors up stairs down stairs and down more corridors. I would hate to be a disabled passenger travelling through Bristol Airport.,1,0
bristol-airport,A Johnson,United Kingdom,I was traveling with my disable husband who needs to be transfered from his wheelchair onto the seat. Assistance on our way out was acceptable but not nice - I heard behind my back unpleasant comments that disabled people shouldn't fly if they cannot transfer on their own. On our way back we experienced very rude unpleasant and unwilling assistance ever. We left airplane 1 hour after landing because we had to wait for assistance. When eventually two people came they were very unpleasant angry and didn't pay any care attention or compassion during transferring my husband.,1,0
bristol-airport,L Eames,United Kingdom,Bristol airport cannot cope with the number of flights. Immigration is a long queue and the machines for the new passports have never been in use since my other half got one. In December they failed to load our suitcases onto an early morning AF flight (can't use the excuse the airport was busy) leaving us without luggage for 96 hours at our destination. The departure lounge is usually very crowded encouraging you into one of the many bars if you want to sit down. There is now a new gate for smaller aircraft. Instead of being bussed out to the plane you can now walk the whole distance up and then down various flights of stairs and along very long corridors. It's not what I would term an improvement.,1,0
bristol-airport,P Cairnduff,United Kingdom,Bristol is small but comfortable and easy to get around. The departures lounge offers excellent views of the runway particularly from restaurants on the Mezzanine level. The automatic boarding card readers at security are an interesting technological development certainly a step up from the traditional manual inspections and you even get an estimated clearance time. It's small size also means that the boarding gates are in close proximity to the departures facilities. Overall a very good airport and with regular bus connections to Temple Meads Station it's definitely your best bet if you're going anywhere in the southwest of England.,4,0
bristol-airport,Peter Cullen,United Kingdom,No improvements since my last report. They have added a sign as you embark on the walk to the western departure area proudly announcing that it is '450m' (is this supposed to make it feel better?). As noted once there you will be standing until boarding begins. Arriving is a complete mess even two flights causes the queue to stretch out of the immigration area and again the automatic passport readers were not working - those who tried them were treated as if it was their fault. I find it sad I can remember when this airport was a pleasure to use but not now.,2,0
bristol-airport,K Sadgrove,United Kingdom,Astonishingly they've just built a new departure area (gate 9) with no disabled access. To get to it you have to descend a flight of steep steps.,1,0
bristol-airport,John Clift,United Kingdom,As with all other reviews this is an airport to avoid if you can. They certainly do not want any passengers money and fees yes. Staff rude security hopeless passport control (how do they meet the fire regs with that set up?) and the so called new terminal well 400 yards plus three sets of stairs just to get to passport control its awful. Coming back yesterday the staff member in charge of arrivals on the tarmac had a look on her face that said it all - why are you passengers coming here and messing up my nice day! Looking at both recent flights its clear business passengers are going elsewhere and those left are infrequent users on holiday flights.,1,0
bristol-airport,C O'Hanlon,United Kingdom,"Used the airport early on a Saturday morning. The £2 charge for a trolley is excessive but we had no choice as we were travelling with our 10 month old son. Check in for Easyjet flights was efficient and the queue at security could have been a lot worse. Departure lounge very cramped with the number of shops / restaurants they have crammed in which means there was limited seating. On the return we were parked at the far end of the new concourse and saw a sign that it was ""just"" 390m to the Baggage Carousel. What they fail to tell you is that you go up one flight of steps and down two before you reach Immigration which was a nightmare with our hand luggage and having to carry our son. By the time we reached Immigration I felt as though my arms were going to fall off. I thought it was going to be so much nicer but was slightly disappointed.",3,0
bristol-airport,J Hunter,United Kingdom,Most of the previous reviewers have said it all already. The architect of the recent expansion only seems to know about Shopping Malls and very little about handling passengers. The departure hall now has some seating but the whole area is inadequate for handling the scrums associated with budget airline seating arrangements. Arrivals are a nightmare; a sign at the point disembarking passengers enter the maze say that it is 390m to the luggage hall. As a previous reviewer has pointed out there are no safety notices or indications of emergency exits. The 390m does not include the additional 100m or so provided by the UK Border agency as a queuing maze. Some of the UK Border agency officials are sufficiently sadistic to take pleasure watching elderly passengers some with walking difficulties struggling through the maze in an almost empty queuing hall. One slight improvement because of the long walk and the poor behaviour of the UK Border agency there was almost no wait for one's luggage in the luggage hall.,3,0
broome-airport,Charles Halton,,Quirky but fun. Very simple and tropical style terminal. It's pretty hard to get uptight here because the whole place is laid-back Broome style. Walked to town from the airport (it's not very far and don't do this in the wet season which is hot and humid; but on a beautiful July evening with the stars above the cicadas singing and wrapped up in the warm night air it's very special. Beer is cold at the bar the parking was free but had to pay for wi-fi which is a downer.,3,0
broome-airport,Joshua Smith,,Nice little airport. Size is adequate for the small number of flights a day. Departures and arrivals are separate buildings so it is quick to check-in and collect baggage. Departure hall is basically a pergola with a shop and a bar but it's fine. On arrival you get free trolleys which is a bonus.,,0
bristol-airport,M Banks,United Kingdom,It's getting worse! Now we have to pay £2 for a luggage trolley wait nearly an hour for luggage and have no where to sit when the planes are delayed. It used to be much nicer but has expanded from good through mediocre to poor. The electronic passport machines actually take LONGER than the other queue - my wife was quicker by about 3 mins! - and require staff to help everyone who uses the machines. Not the end to a nice holiday you expect. Don't get me started about the buses back home.,2,0
bristol-airport,Derek Hanney,United Kingdom,Two recent flights from Bristol and we are not impressed the 10 minute drop off area is a nightmare I dropped my wife and then was stuck in a traffic jam for 25 minutes. I booked Premier Parking but dropped my wife off first because I have a back problem the path from Premier Parking is all uphill not only that I couldn't find a place to park when I got in there ( And yes I did prepay) I drove around until a space was vacated. We have booked a Christmas trip through Bristol but it will be the last. We would rather use Gatwick even though its a 2.5 hour trip as opposed to 1 hour. The actual airport is poorly laid out with a lack of seating.,1,0
bristol-airport,J Berry,United Kingdom,The routes to and from the Airport are awful bewildering and more than a little poorly signed. The on-airport car parks are extortionate considering that we're talking about a place that would otherwise be a field in the middle of nowhere. They are also little more than rubble : poor to drive on and even poorer to walk on for those with mobility problems. The route from the car parks to the main airport building is steep - again problematic for those with impaired mobility. Very limited seating inside the airport. The need to spend £1 just to get a clear plastic bag adds insult to injury. The airport needs drastic improvement.,2,0
bristol-airport,P Higgins,United Kingdom,I transferred my allegiances to LHR some time ago and frequently revisit these pages to see if things have improved. It doesn't appear so. I did use BRS for a flight via AMS last month a mid morning flight and there were no queues and security was a breeze. Returning on the late flight brought the usual delays on baggage and passport control. I will score it on this experience. The scheduled flights from BRS are quite a bit more expensive than you can get at LHR these days and if using terminal 5 the logistics there are now working very well. With checked in baggage I can be at Paddington within 40 mins of the plane arriving at the gate.,3,0
bristol-airport,Glyn Jones,United Kingdom,The airport has to some extent scored an own goal by replacing too much public seating in the departure areas with additional retail and refreshment outlets. Bristol has no control over the way the Border Agency operates whose main priority is not ensuring a pleasant passenger experience through the airport that's not to say they deliberately try to make it unpleasant. The airport provides sufficient stations for the Border Agency staff but often they are not fully manned. I've used the airport for many years and broadly it provides a decent service but the main thing is there are plenty of routes which means I can avoid Heathrow for the most part.,4,0
bristol-airport,K Painter,Czech Republic,This year it seemed that all the money invested has made the airport worse. Car parking fees are a rip off now 10 only minutes free difficult to get the luggage and the kids to the car and out of the car park in that time. The queues for passport control which have always been terrible are now almost unbearable (this was around midnight as well) people queuing up the steps to the outside doors with a nightmarish post office queuing system. We were very lucky as my wife was carrying our sleeping 4 year old and a very nice female officer let us jump the complete queue from the bottom of the stairs to the front of the queue wonderful lady must have saved us at least 30 minutes. Returning I was surprised to find that half the seats had gone from the departure lounge and when we were called to our flight we had to walk for what seemed like miles through a seemingly endless maze of corridors and stairs a problem if you have a walking disability. So Bristol get it sorted more seating in departures and some at the gates for disabled/ children but most of all speed up and sort out this awful queuing system at passport control. On the plus side I find the staff quite friendly and helpful.,3,0
bristol-airport,A Davis,United Kingdom,Parking was simple and we could easily pull our suitcases to Departures. Check-in staff polite sailed through security - staff a bit sullen. In the Departure lounge a little less seating downstairs but there is seating upstairs in the food court and nobody was told off for sitting without purchasing food or drink. Duty free well laid out and the staff were breezy. On our return border control was slow and a little sullen collected bags and back at the car within an hour.,4,0
bristol-airport,C Traynor,United Kingdom,Had connecting flights through Bristol in July the first time we have used the airport. We travelled with hand luggage only so can't pass comment on the checking in process. I agree with previous comments about security staff - unpleasant rude and surly there really is no need for this kind of attitude towards passengers. The departures lounge is badly designed with gate queues snaking through the seating areas causing a lot of confusion. We used the servisair lounge which was quiet but could see there is a major problem with a lack of seating in the general areas. It's a shame really because the airport itself is bright airy and quite attractive.,3,0
bristol-airport,John Clift,United Kingdom,The recent comments about the facilities or acute lack of them at this airport are true they have removed almost all seating in the departure area and replaced them with a range of retail emporiums. As an airport this must one of the few in the world that ends up worse after a major refurbishment than before they started. The so called new gate area is really a covered corridor to replace the awful buses they use nothing more. Only for the fact its close to my home I would not use the place. Considering they have amongst the highest passenger fees in the UK and if you add in the extortionate car parking its nothing sort of a rip off.,1,0
bristol-airport,P Williams,United Kingdom,On using Bristol Airport for a trip to Greece recently I was staggered by the new arrangements for passengers there. The main departure lounge has been stripped of seating forcing passengers to use the retail areas and purchase expensive food and drink. Once a gate is called there is now an extremely long walk some of it uphill and involving stairs. There is no seating and no facilities for half-a-mile! A modern airport should surely have escalators and moving walkways over such a long distance. Then on reaching the gate there is - unbelievably - no seating at all. We were marshalled into four queues and kept standing for almost half an hour before embarkation. This is not the treatment that modern passengers expect. It is treating people like cattle! Who on earth planned such a disastrous change for the worse?,1,0
bristol-airport,Peter Cullen,United Kingdom,I have used Bristol twice since my last report in April. The concerns of previous reviewers about a severe lack of space are being borne out seating is fully occupied almost all of the time and there is very little space apart from the retail area. As the previous report said the walk to flights leaving from the western apron is lengthy; they allow for this by calling flights well before they are due to leave. OK if you are reasonably mobile but are there more seats when you get to your gate? Guess. So that is another 15 minutes of standing around. As before the queue for passport checks on arrival is laughably long most of the time (the new scanners were not working this week - though were on my previous visit).,2,0
bristol-airport,John Clift,United Kingdom,Bristol is predictable rude staff long queues lack of seating poor and expensive facilities with a long wait for bags to come off on return. All in all a poor airport. How do they get away with having such long closed corridors to and from the gate areas with no fire exits or marked escape route? In the so called new terminal it appears that there is not emergency lighting either. I am starting to think like other commentators below maybe its time to fly from LHR or BHX. Long haul connections at AMS or CDG are now getting so long due to flight cutbacks it adds almost half a day to all journeys.,1,0
bristol-airport,S Kendall,United Kingdom,The facilities were fair though snaking customs queues unnecessary. Duty Free shop offered goods found considerably cheaper on the high street. Boarding was reasonable although seating in the waiting area limited. Parking is highway robbery and taxis cost £42 return. I travelled again in May - an absolute nightmare. The snaking queues for customs were worse there was almost no available seating in the waiting areas - most space taken up by new cafes and retail shops. Then there was the walk to the aircraft! I am a pensioner with walking difficulties though not bad enough to warrant being disabled. Is it possible that untold millions have been spent to expand the airport and that they have not seen fit to provide escalators or moving walkways or lifts. If it had not been for the kindness of others who helped me up innumerable stairs and along the half-mile (confirmed by an official a half- mile!) walk to the boarding gate I don't know what I'd have done. From now on Heathrow will be a better option: a comfortable return journey by coach will only cost £25.,2,0
bristol-airport,A Quinn,United Kingdom,Modernisation at Bristol seems to be solely for the benefit of the retailers and not passengers. I agree that the security staff are amongst the most surly and miserable I've come across. However there is now one thing that redeems it for me. Bristol has a smoking area after security. As far as I'm aware it is the only airport in the UK that provides this facility. Nicotine addicts are treated like prisoners at other airports which is more than a bit cynical since they all derive profits from selling cigarettes. Congratulations to Bristol Airport for recognising the needs of this persecuted group of travellers.,3,0
bristol-airport,Peter Cullen,United Kingdom,Like the previous reviewers I have been a regular (6-10 times a year) user of Bristol over the past 20 years. Last weekend was my first visit in 2010 and I have to agree that the amount of seating has reached the point where it is inadequate in all but the very quietest times. I do not know if the on-going expansion will address this problem but if not there will be major problems in the summer - the amount of physical space available even for standing has been reduced drastically. Where is one supposed to go if one does not want overpriced food and drink? There are still good things about Bristol: the long-stay car park is expensive but a two minute walk from the terminal building and on Saturday we checked-in went through departure control and security in about five minutes total (it was a quiet time of day). The management need to be aware that one of best UK airport experiences (in my opinion) is rapidly approaching average at best.,3,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,A Kelly,United Kingdom,The airport is far too small to handle the number of passengers visiting and this was on a wet Monday in March. Dread to think what it would be like in summer. On the arrivals side there is one narrow corridor where everyone mingles and consequently no one goes anywhere quickly. Decent sandwich at Paul's though and not bad value. However the departure gates have to be the worst aspect of the airport experience. There is hardly any seating so the vast majority of people are sprawled on the floor. Very disappointing experience.,2,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,A Moreau,United States,"Eat before you come here! There is no good food at this airport except for a sandwich place near Gate 10. The main eating area is shoved in your face after the metal detectors and you have to walk through it to get to your gate. The overpriced low quality food and shopping screams ""haw haw we dragged you out to a rural airport and now you can't leave."" WiFi is 3 euros for 30 minutes.",2,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,Karin Smits,Netherlands,We had a flight with Ryanair out to Malaga. When we arrived we had to line up for going through security which is normal but there we were packed it was hard to do. There were many people packed together it was very narrow no space to breath. Once through security you come through the tax free store which is an ok store. They plane was delayed and we had to hang out in the terminal. The toilets were very dirty. I saw a cleaning lady with a trolley but apparently she did not have to clean the toilets. We ate and drank at Meli Melo. It was awful. I had to stand in line for twenty minutes. The french speaking guy was totally inadequate to be working at the counter. The whole terminal was narrow not a lot of space like in most other airports. I prefer not to go there anymore.,4,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,Giannicola Bonora,Italy,Relatively new and shining clean due to the generous use of stainless steel. Epitome for the low-cost airport of the XXI century: Extra long and narrow tarmac to avoid using buses or skyways. Where the similarly long and narrow building can't reach there are long covered walkways airside. Be prepared for possible long walks both on arriving and departing. This is an airport that depends on Ryanair so you can't expect any pity. Asking for a boarding pass (a minimalist slip of paper) for a checked in flight costs 70 euros no matter what. There are two ATM machines in the hall one near the arrivals one at the opposite corner of the building (on the left exiting from airside). Exiting at this same corner you can reach the bus station where you can buy a ticket for Charleroi South Station from the machines (coins notes cards accepted). The bus station is not covered and Charleroi is a very rainy place but lucky enough you get the bus from platform A which is the nearest to the terminal. On departing I was puzzled by the double way in at security apparently doing the same things but working alternatively. Security fast and professional. Duty free looks good but I had no time to spend. After stepping to the gates you are in no- man land: long minimalist bleaky corridors where the stainless steel only adds up to the coldness of the environment. There's a bakery stand before the last hop to the tarmac. In winter I suggest buying a hot drink. The low cost travel industry states that if passengers have to wait they have to do it as close as possible to the aircraft they are boarding and in this airport this means in the open air though under a covered walkway.,7,1
brussels-charleroi-airport,C Haas,Belgium,"Bad points - Directions to the airport are confusing : at times you will see two signs ""Airport"" pointing in opposite directions. Arrival Hall is way too small Parking only allows to park your car for 10 minutes for free. Although some signs in front of the parking lot say 15 minutes. Still no direct train connections to the airport after all those years. Good: Clean and modern facilities. Low cost hub to many destinations.",5,1
brussels-charleroi-airport,M McManus,United Kingdom,Charleroi is one of two airports serving the city of Brussels but Charleroi is quite some distance from Brussels. Charleroi is popular because the rock-bottom price discount airlines that fly to Brussels are based here rather than Brussels Zaventem. Be warned the security lines at Charleroi do take quite some time to clear around 30 minutes compared to perhaps half that time at Brussels Zaventem. Decent choice of food air side though pricey. Toilets were slightly cramped. Bus service to Charleroi-Sud train station will take you where you can catch a train to Brussels (takes about 1 hour by train). There is also the Ryanair coach if you prefer that. Some hotels in Charleroi provide a shuttle taxi to/from the airport.,7,1
brussels-charleroi-airport,Geert Janssen,Belgium,Excellent airport: very efficient clean friendly people no queues for check-in or customs. Excellent parking with reasonable rates. However limited restaurants railway connection is not good (compared to Brussels) with a limited number of flights.,8,1
brussels-charleroi-airport,Steven Wood,Belgium,In a line for 20 minutes to show passport and boarding pass. Asked to leave the line to put my iPad in my carry on case. Rejoined the line and passed through to security and the usual snake. 20 minutes on and still 9 people in front of me. They opened up 2 more lanes and let all the people behind me through. Complained and told all lines were the same. Removed belt watch and jacket and placed in tray. Told to take iPad back out of carry on. Passed through scanner in socks slacks and shirt. Set off alarm and told to stand for body touchdown. Then given the most obtrusive pat down in 30 years. Thought I would have a nice lunch before boarding on a par with McDonald's on a bad day and twice the price. All this before the usual delights of Ryanair.,1,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,Sonja Koechert,Austria,This airport is a total disaster! There is no way to drop off passengers without going to/through the express parking. There are hundreds of cars squeezed in all at the same time 90% of them unloading passengers and baggage while blocking the flow. Access signage on the highway is more than poorly done. How about simply copying systems which work in other parts of the world? Inside the airport there is no space at all for exiting passengers. They are all packed together in a far too small corridor. The bottom line is simple: if you can just avoid this airport.,2,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,J Fischer,United States,Positives - relatively clean airport convenient and easy to move around when there aren't any queues. Negatives - there is nothing to do in the airport besides drinking awful tasting coffee buying over-priced magazines going on the internet (which costs a fortune and takes forever to load) and wait for your flight. Staff in 99% of cases only speak French and very broken English. Bus and Train are horrific. Road indications to the airport are borderline non-existent.,3,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,Diane Dumont,Belgium,Disregard for the well-being of disabled passengers. My mother who is 75 disabled hard of hearing was forced to go through passport and security controls alone in a wheelchair with an adolescent worker while my dad had to go through on his own on the other side. This caused much distress to all concerned. At Edinburgh airport there was absolutely no problem for them to go through together.,1,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,Michael O'Brien,Spain,The bus connection between the airport and Brussels is a disaster. Do not rely on it there is a good possibility that when you arrive outside Brussels midi station the only bus will have gone full the second bus will have broken down and then you will be accosted by carefully planted taxi drivers who will inform you that the only way to get to Charleroi is with them for 40 euros plus. A disgrace.,2,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,C Kube,Germany,"Parking is more expensive than flying from Charleroi. Most times. Too few seats it's rather dirty.

brussels-charleroi-airport,T Lodge,Belgium,Difficult to find especially at the moment while extensive roadworks are going on causing a long detour. I paid 55 euros for slightly over 2 days parking in the long term car park so I will avoid parking there in the future as much as possible. Driving once inside the huge parking area is quite impossible there are signs for the exit pointing in different directions leading to an unplanned tour of the car park. The facilities are poor and expensive inside also.,3,0

brussels-charleroi-airport,Ann Cleary,United Kingdom,I now avoid this airport if I possibly can - Brussels Zaventem is infinitely superior in every respect.

Really it is worth paying a few euros more and fly from elsewhere to be treated like a human being.,2,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,G Guigz,Spain,I travel a lot to through this airport because it offers the only flight from Brussels to Valladolid and it's an absolute disaster.

brussels-charleroi-airport,Chris Hansen,Belgium,"This is one of the worst airports on busy days. It is impossible to find if you come from Brussels.

I hate passing through Charleroi and I only buy tickets for airlines from here when the price difference is massive.",2,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,S Bott,United Kingdom,The airport is relatively easy to get too - that is if you can spot the tiny airport symbol on the exit sign on the E42/A7 motorway. The symbol is so small that even with long-distance glasses I nearly missed the junction. Once there the airport itself is small compact modern clean and easy to navigate around both when departing and arriving. The announcements both in the terminal and in the car park are clear and precise. The parking is on the expensive side but there are plenty of spaces available. Overall a good experience.,4,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,F Costa,Italy,It is really difficult to get to the airport road indications are scarcely visible parking are too expensive for the quality of the airport bus from the train station have a very low frequency and often it is needed to wait a lot in open air.

brussels-charleroi-airport,Rosario Russo,Italy,It's quite small with a few and very expensive shops but it's clean and new.

Cheap bus to go to the train station just outside the building.,3,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,Robert Phillips,Belgium,Despite having spent millions on updating Charleroi airport - it still remains a pretty poor neighbour to the 'real' Brussels airport. Very poor signposting to get there expensive and confusing car parking facilities poor (and expensive) public transport connections. The airport has aspirations to be a large international hub but frankly it still remains a local secondary airport - poor service lack of information things dont work - shops overpriced with very restricted hours. Even the security and border controls are slow and inefficient. Yes if you can get a cheap fare with Ryanair/Wizzair etc etc its OK but this comes at a price - sometimes it works (if you're not hit by a strike or foggy weather or a late night arrival and the airport closes) but overall not a particularly pleasant airport to fly in and out of.,2,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,Matthew Ross,,"The new terminal is a vast improvement on the old one - more spacious and much better facilities. The""Paul sandwich shop is good. Some attention to detail is required - for example the soap dispensers in the toilets needed refilling priority boarding on Ryanair was a farce. The airport location (at Charleroi) is its biggest drawback - a long way from Brussels. The airport bus is reliable but unpleasant. I have used it several times; the buses are getting rather dirty inside. A good clean of the upholstery is needed. Signposting to the airport bus at Brussels Midi station is still hopeless - unless you know that it departs from the Rue de France you could spend ages trying to find it.",4,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,Matthias Ruebben,,The online check-in worked very well at Charleroi (the did not work at Shannon Airport on the way back). We had to wait nearly one hour at the customs when we arrived back from Shannon. I never waited at the customs for more than 10 minutes at any airport. They charged me 4260 EURO for 3 days parking. Before I knew these things I booked another flight in July from Charleroi. The car would park there for 2 weeks.,2,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,G Gramazio,,I arrived and departed from CRL new terminal in the last 2 weeks. It's quite clean and modern and friendly. The staff spoke at least a basic English or even Italian (there are many Italian immigrants in that area). Ordinary busses available to reach Bruxelles the cost is €8 for a no- return ticket and takes 1hr to get to the Bruxelles Midi railway station. Fast baggage delivery. On the coming back fast check-in and self check-in terminals are available just select your flight and enter your booking code. Clear audio message in English French and Flemish. In the public area you can find a chemist a bar-restaurant and a cafe where they sell sandwiches and sweets plus a very good press shop. The boarding area is quite small there is a big duty free shop selling usual things you can find there but also a good selection of chocolate. Unfortunately the prices are a bit higher than in other places. Also available is a small restaurant. Drinks do cost much more than in Rome: €3.00 for a 0.5l bottle of Coke! Definitely a positive experience being a new airport.,3,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,M Stanford-Eyre,,I hope the new terminal has better facilities. I found the airport people fine and the Ryanair automatic checkin worked perfectly. The only point I would warn people about was that because it is such a small airport the check in really did close 40 minutes before departure and our 10.40pm scheduled flight was rolled out and airborne by 10.10m ! Not many passengers on it but a great leveller of Ryanair statistics! Don't be late here! Priority boarding a total farce though.,3,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,Alex Murzynski,,"CRL has finally had a cash machine installed an event proudly announced on its website as if it were a very special privilege granted to the passengers. Beware of the said website because it is hardly ever updated and the info on the shuttle bus service to Brussels is misleading. You CANNOT buy your ticket on the bus in spite of what it says and the place is full of disgruntled passengers hauling their gear back into the airport to buy a ticket. Amazingly this has been going on for at least a year and will continue to do so because this airport clearly follows a strict policy of ignoring all complaints and e-mails. Still the coach is the least bad way of getting to Brussels as the local bus and train schedules are hopelessly mismatched. Another major pain at this airport is the lack of seating and practically nothing to do landside and absolutely nothing to do airside. Boarding is invariably annoying as the hapless staff makes no attempt to control the free-for-all. All you can hope for is that things will change with the new terminal due to open ""in 2007"". Until then bring something to read and to eat and prepare to have your patience tested.",,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,James Gibson,,I agree with most of the comments made about this airport. The catering is basic and not very appetising and the terminal building doesn't look too nice and it really lacks a cash machine. The last time I flew into Charleroi it was a Sunday - the journey took me five hours and it's only 100 miles! I had to wait an hour for the bus to Charleroi train station. As the bus pulled in the train to Brussels pulled out and I had to wait another hour. At Brussels I had to wait about 50 minutes! I think the transport authorities in Belgium need to get their act together. I wonder if things will be much different when the new terminal building opens next year.,,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,John Kotsopoulos,,Granted you're flying a discount airline out of this airport and therefore should not be expecting much. Still this airport is woeful. Inexplicably there is not a single automatic bank machine in the entire building. Clearly the authorities have no interest in you spending any money there. The smoke-infested cafeteria will not even accept local Belgian bank cards. They will however accept VISA on any purchase over 15euros! Thanks a lot! I boarded my flight starving and thirsty and feeling like a fool for not having packed a picnic before leaving home.,,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,Matthew Ross,,Functional but very basic and cramped. Ryanair and Wizz are the main carriers so the cheap n' cheerful image is perpetuated in the airport's facilities - or lack thereof. The bus link from Brussels departs from rue de France (round the back of the Gare du Midi) - this can be difficult to find if you're unfamiliar with the city and can be pretty crowded. There is also a bus to Charleroi railway station. The security check is very strict; anything metal has to be removed especially belts. The catering facilities are poor - before security there's one rather scruffy smoky cafe plus a few vending machines. It is not at all convenient for Brussels in fact it's about halfway between Brussels and the French border. All-in-all the poor relation to Brussels Airport.,,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,Alberto Pezzotti,,This is a tiny airport. Disembarking is really fast. Once you're in the main area ther is not much you can do. I spent a good hour in the really basic cafeteria waiting for somebody that was going to pick me up. In conclusion it's a really good option if you have to visit the region of Lille/Calais or the south of Belgium. It's clearly not a good option if you want to visit Brussels.,,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,John Emley,,The airport is certainly tiny! Arriving there was good off the plane quick straight onto a connecting bus to Brussels. Staff at the information stand were helpful & spoke English. The outbound journey wasn't as pleasant security was over zealous (having to remove belt watch etc) and very unfriendly. Didn't bother using the 'canteen' in the cupboard (departure lounge 1) and there was a big crush fighting fellow passengers to get on the aircraft. The toilets in the lounge were filthy stinking & graffitid. Having said that for a flight that cost about the same as a pizza it's worth putting up with and I'd use it again.,,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,Simon Summers,,"This airport is like a disused IKEA store cum warehouse. It is tiny and cramped the cafeteria ""Sharkeys"" is lousy expensive and smoky. Passing through the ""drastic"" security measures (which they state on their website) means removing EVERY piece of metal - belts watches et al. The ""other side"" is like hell. You're straight at the gate - no facilities where you sweat it gathering your energies to barge past your fellow passengers and run on to your plane.",,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,David Flynn,,Small airports are generally intimate friendly and welcoming. Not so with Charleroi. It is dirty seriously overcrowded at peak times and facilities are terrible. Ryanair does a good job of running a base on these facilities mind.

brussels-charleroi-airport,Neil Harvey,,Waited an hour in a corridor for baggage but ours was the only arrival in 3 hours. Waited 45 mins for the bus driver to let people on then he went off for a 30 min fag break which meant we missed the connecting train to Brussels we could have walked quicker to town centre. Return journey was even worse with one room which combined a corner shop style duty free school canteen snack bar non segregated smoking area which led to a single stinking toilet. It was a relief when the exits opened and we all made a charge for our non pre-allocated seats. Cheap but not cheerful next time I will pay the extra and fly direct from Manchester to Brussels Zaventem.,,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,Stephen D'Arcy,,"The previous comment is so off the mark it must have been written by one of the ""anti-Ryanair"" squad. Getting to / from the airport: an executive coach leaves Brussels south station (Gare du Midi) 2h. 30m. before each flight departure. As the average journey (± 60 km) takes one hour the bus arrives 90 minutes before the flight departs - in other words 60 minutes before check-in closes. The bus parks ± 50 metres from the departures door. For the return journey: buses leave the airport 20 mins or so after the flight arrivals back to Brussels Gare du Midi. At weekends I have done this journey in 40 minutes. Cost: €10.00 single payable to the driver. This includes an arbitrary €3.60 tax imposed by the Chairleroi Airport which is the subject of a legal action by Ryanair who charter the buses. Train / bus connections are not so good. I have written twice to TEC (Charleroi) asking why at weekends their ""connectional"" bus #68 from the airport arrives at Charleroi Railway station three minutes AFTER the hourly trains depart to Brussels. No intellgible answer was forthcoming - but they are Francophones and don't ever take criticism - just offer a ""Gallic shrug"". A ""joined-up public transport service"" - NOT! Parking is plentiful and cheap with free shuttle buses to/from the terminal every 10 minutes. The cafe resembles a motorway service station in UK but food and drink are comparatively cheap for the standard offered. Best to stock up here before your 60-90 minute flight so that you don't die of starvation or pay €9.00 on-board for a sandwich. This can be more than the cost of the flight! From the terminal passengers walk to the plane across the tarmac ± 100 metres. Boarding is fronty and rear so very quick. In the new Schengen terminal in Brussels Zaventem airport it can take up to 20 minutes to walk to the most remote departure gate! There are plans to expand Charleroi Airport with a second terminal in 2006 assuming that the European Commission's latest investigation hasn't scuppered the Ryanair operation by then. I have no connection with Charleroi Airport nor with Ryanair (the only flight operator).",,0
brussels-charleroi-airport,James O'Brien,,The airport resulbles a shack. A very bad cafe and unfriendly staff across the whole airport. I will never use this airport again. It is a nightmare even trying to get to this excuse of an airport. My advice to anybody thinking of using this airport use Brussels National insteade.,,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,W Kmen,United States,"This is an incredibly confusing airport. Check in was fine but the passage to the gates winds through poorly marked duty free stores. Security was also good but by the third time you have to ask yourself ""where to now?"" the frustration has built. If I had been in a hurry I would have become furious.",4,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,Kurt de Pril,Belgium,Zaventem my home airport. Lots of nostalgic childhood memories because of the Sabena frequent flyer status of my father. Nowadays very nice check in lounge lots of good food drinking options Zaventem was and is Belgium's number one airport. The luggage pick up is still too slow. Smoking lounges too overcrowded and too small. But despite this few minor negative points Zaventem is a good organised clean airport its still the number one hub in Europe.,8,1
brussels-zaventem-airport,Jain Anand,India,Brussels to Zurich - The first impression was a disorderly airport and long queues. Not a very appealing interior ill-planned layout of the airport makes you go up and down several times. Not many things to look for while waiting for the flight. This airport is clearly not at par with other European standard airports.,4,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,S Smeets,Netherlands,I flew from BRU on a transatlantic flight to New York. I arrived well in time but the Airport security had a 2 hour waiting line at the passport check. This meant that I almost missed my flight which was extremely frustrating. I cannot comprehend why this Airport is so incompetent in one of its main duties. I recommend flying out of AMS or DUS.,1,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,N Jansen,Belgium,I've read some of the critical reviews on this site and while Brussels airport is not the best airport I know I believe things have got better lately. The frequency of trains to and from the airport has increased some trains are still the old shuttle trains from Brussels but others are the very reasonable longer distance trains running through Belgium. The roadworks close to the airport are over. But more roadworks could be planned. The departure hall can be crowded but some low cost flights are now handled in a separate extension of the departure hall making room in the rest of the airport. The Schengen gates used to be accessible via a long underground tunnel with lots of escalators. These have gone now: there is a new 'connector' building that is much more pleasant to go to the A gates. The new shops toilets restaurants in the A gates area look nice some restaurants still close relatively early. The non-Schengen gates are less bright but the new connector building now also improves the transfer from A to C gates and vice-versa. On my last visit to the airport my luggage was on the luggage retrieval belt before I got there so zero wait. The arrival hall is still the low-ceiling area it used to be quite unwelcoming.,8,1
brussels-zaventem-airport,J Pojon,Belgium,"1) Please stop continuously changing gates! On our most recent trip it was changed an unbelievable 5 times! 2) Invest in an adequate loudspeaker system. 3) The acoustic is from the dark ages. 4) Various areas are not covered by working loudspeakers. 5) Train the announcers to articulate to slow down. 6) Employ people with excellent foreign language skills or native speakers. 7) Install more info counters. 8) Learn from ""top"" airports.",4,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,T Flanagan,United Kingdom,As long as I live I will never get a connecting flight from this airport again nightmare of a journey from Gates A to B if your on a tight connecting flight expect to be running around. Expect very poor signage and awful attitude from airport staff and officials.,,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,Johan Stronkhorst,Belgium,I am a regular visitor of Zaventem Airport unfortunately because it is one of the worst airports in Europe. Traffic to the airport is a nightmare. Narrow and always blocked by never ending roadworks. Trains to the airport are dirty and at least 40 year old wrecks and you pay an horrendous price. Ticket area for trains is small dirty and always full with people queuing for the one single open sales point. (Machines do not accept foreign cards or credit cards.) Luggage delivery takes an average of 1.5 hours (yes 1.5 hours) almost a world record. Waiting time for the passport control can be up to 2 hours. The non-Schengen shopping area is almost non-existent. -Cleanliness and overall the state of maintenance is very poor. My advise go to Paris CDG. From there 1h 12m TGV to Brussels. That's much quicker as fighting yourself trough the Zaventem chaos.,,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,Gerd Pfeil,Germany,I had the bad luck to spend 3 hours at EBBR in the transfer area. My connection flight to England with Brussels Airlines was delayed 2hrs which was actually good because the ways from the arrival gate to the departure gate B30 was a nightmare of a walk. After passing through yet another security land and yet another passport check (Schengen my butt) I had to walk another few kilometres to the gate in order to wait there for my flight. Being used to rather posh German airports the overall appearance of this airport was: a bland megalomaniac hellhole of gigantic boredom with everything outdated. Endless corridors to the gates and ending with dirty and tasteless seats in the waiting areas not to mention the toilets. It's like entering a 3rd-world country. If you are a smoker you'll appreciate the extremely sparse smoking areas. Very few bistros (I actually saw only one) that close very soon in the evening and a saddening mass of saddening vending machines top off the overall horrible experience with that airport. If I can avoid passing though EBBR I'll pay any amount of Euros to do so.,2,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,José Liu,Canada,Worst airport visited. Long line up for immigration and no indication at all first line up 30 minutes then an airport staff member told us that we were at the wrong line we had headed to another line for international passengers even longer we spent 1 hour and 15 minutes to get through the immigration which was my flight departure time. Air Canada staff were kindly waiting for us at the last minute.,,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,Dennis Parass,Canada,"I will never book a trip with Brussels airport as the transfer point. While the airport facilities were good transferring from hall A to Hall B is a disaster. We were leaving Europe and it is necessary to line up for passport review. There was a line 150 feet long about 200 people and they only have 2 stations to serve you. Serve is the wrong word it took 40 minutes to get through this point. The two staff were rude. They have very poor signage and it turned out that one line was for Euro Zone residents and the other for non Euro people. People were crowded into lines trying to get to the front only to be told they were in the wrong one. People were complaining because they were going to miss their flights. It was chaos. Then to top it off this young Passport Control supervisor yells at everyone that if they don't calm down he ""will close the border""! The root problem is that this transfer area is only designed to have two kiosks. They can't even put more staff on. The worst bottleneck design I have seen in my many years travelling.",,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,S Crowe,Canada,Having arrived from Montreal (YUL) after originally departing from Toronto (YYZ) and being about 03.00 by my body clock I found my way to passport control ok reasonable queue very nice officers and then off to Duty Free before connecting to Bristol (BRS). Arriving in the non-Schengen zone my connection was also in the same zone so I headed off to the desk for the connection on my ticket. A quick trip through fast track security and off to the gate. Seems that I missed that flight and the desk agent ran off to do something or other to get me moving. She returned and handed me a new ticket for KLM to AMS. Back though passport control again no queue at all same nice officers and off to the other terminal. The ticket barcode access scanner for fast track security tells me to go to the original terminal and refuses to open so I just jump the rail and tell a security person on duty about the plane change who lets me through with no question. Second time through security scanning another passport stamp (3 in 1 hour) and off to the gate. Agent says to me with a dirty look that she was looking for me hours ago. Explained the changes and delays she turned pleasant checked me in and hit my seat with moments to spare. All in all it was a bit of a crazy time but it worked out and I had no real issues with any staff clerks officers at all. Will be back at BRU again next June when I'll have a one day stop-over to properly suss out the airport. But until then I give it a Recommended rating.,7,1
brussels-zaventem-airport,A Skidmore,United Kingdom,Awful possibly the worst transfer I've ever done. B gates are very old and shabby and involve a huge walk from the A terminal. Had to go through baggage claim and security again despite only travelling between Portugal and the UK on a connecting code share flight. Also had to argue for quite some time to allow my duty free to travel through security. Final insult was that my connecting flight was heavily delayed with very little information and the bars all closed at 7.30 despite there being a World Cup on and flights still leaving up to 11. Terrible experience will avoid like the plague.,,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,Jos Van Looy,Belgium,I am always amazed about the poor quality of Brussels Zaventem airport. Whereas departures may go smoothly arrivals are a nightmare. Luggage takes average up to 40 minutes after landing in the best case whereas airports much bigger such as HKG Singapore and Barcelona who manage to deliver them by the time you get to the carrousel. Luggage delivery is unorganized and usually a big mess. While everyone is waiting for his luggage you may have to collect more revenue from parking.,1,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,J Garforth,Canada,Worst airport I have ever been in after 60 years of travelling all over the world. There was incorrect labelling of connections and we were sent in the wrong direction by an airport staff member who was directing passengers. This caused us to miss a very tight connection. Security was so offensive.,,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,John Southall,United Kingdom,Using Brussels airport for transit was a nightmare this morning. All transit passengers have to go through long queues for passport control and security which led the flight delay overunning outgoing flight time. This was delayed luckily - but passenger announcements were not made to let those involved know. Just that the last call had been made. The distance between the incoming gates and outgoing gates is truly enormous - but why when we were put on a bus to drive a further few kms to get to the aircraft? Why not have bus after a short walk if it has to go that far? Why were the Security staff telling us to go back to the check in desk to get another flight (and have to go through Passport Control and Security again) without first checking if the flight was being held (which they did at the second attempt)? Finally on arrival at destination - no baggage - it is still a Brussels. I will not try these routes again.,,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,C Newham,Australia,"29 July 2013. Worst Airport in Europe. Had to fly out of here on busy day. Allowed 3 hours. Small signs. Rude personnel apart from check-in man who was good. Tax refund department quote ""this is not my regular job"" as he dropped forms (losing 2 permanently) and shuffled papers. Huge queues. Unable to process English tax forms at Travelex in Brussels Airport. Poor duty free. Limited calls for airline lucky to reach airline on last call despite allowing 3 hours for check in.",1,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,Frank Ajandi,France,Missed connecting flight due to huge backlog in passport customs control. In addition to this did not receive luggage to and from destination due to baggage handlers work to rule strike. Too much ground to cover when making a connecting flight.,,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,L Lodhia,France,Having to go from section A to B entails having to go through security and passport control and the distance is very long. This would not be an issue if there was plenty of time between flights. The 3 factors combined distance + passport control + security resulted in my being bumped of the flight as the airline thought 30 mins was not enough time to get from sector A to B. Then there is the baggage handlers strike which has added fuel to fire on the return. We have not heard from Swissport who handlers baggage on the status of the strike. The website does not recognize the airline tag when you try and get the status of your baggage. Almost a week later and no one has bothered to contact the passengers either by email or by phone. We had to wait 2 hours to get file our lost luggage claim in Paris. I lost money for the pre-paid taxi as a result which Swissport said they would not pay. So all in all I would not recommend flying through Brussels airport.,3,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,Charles Murray,Belgium,"This is my local airport which I use regularly. Easy access and plentiful parking. Spacious clean and easy to navigate terminals. Queues through security now shorter than previously. Good selection of shops and restaurants/cafes in the Schengen terminal. Major negative for me is the interminable time it takes to retrieve gold clubs on arrival and often having to ""go looking"" for them. Probably the worst airport I have experienced on this point.",7,1
brussels-zaventem-airport,Indranil Chakrabarty,Australia,Transited through BRU en-route to ORD. The airport is nice and clean though dated. Did not look flashy like O'Hare. Staff are helpful. Quiet understated airport. The cafe was nice and selection of food excellent. Not crowded like many other Airports in Europe but duty free selection is nice. This is a good airport for transiting. Not a madhouse like LHR. Was bussed to the waiting Sabena plane.,7,1
brussels-zaventem-airport,M Kindt,Belgium,Having travelled around the world I am always amazed about the poor quality of Brussels Zaventem airport which happens to be my home airport. Whereas departures may go smoothly arrivals are a nightmare. Many times the plane cannot get to the gate because ground staff are not present so we have to wait. Luggage takes average up to 40 minutes after landing in the best case whereas airports much bigger such as HKG Singapore and Barcelona who manage to deliver them by the time you get to the carrousel. Luggage delivery is unorganized and usually a big mess with several planes on 1 carrousel and the next carrousel empty. Cleanliness is so poor the restrooms smell and are dirty the waiting seats are dirty.,1,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,M Mayer,Austria,The airport does what it needs to do but no more. Access - by bus in/out: long waiting outside overloaded no space for baggage connecting with public transport requires carrying luggage down on crowded narrow stairs - very uncomfortable! By train: in house sometimes very dirty trains no space for baggage - more comfortable better access to the public transport system. Taxis are comfortable but hard to find at first time. Inside walking distances - Prepare yourself for long walks changing levels 3 times up and down on escalators and a huge queue in front of the security screening area in the evenings. Plan 60 mins to arrive at the boarding gate as net fast walk time exceeds 20 mins and wait time at the screening can take 30 mins. Toilets - There are many toilets they are easy to find. There are no toilets in the lounges. Flight information - There is usually no gate information on the screens until -30 of departure but it will be printed on the boarding pass at check-in. WIFI is available but expensive. Restaurants are good but expensive. Lounges are overloaded with people in the evening. The food is far below average. Boarding goes smoothly and usually directly from the terminal over a gangway. Baggage claim - Expect your luggage to be late. Overall nothing is horrible but it's a quite uncomfortable airport for European standards.,3,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,R Anil,Belgium,I used the airport in October 2012. Since it was a morning flight I arrived at the airport by the first train! Had plenty of time to explore the airport. Check in with SN Brussels airlines bound to Milan was smooth. Security control also fast enough. The immigration agent friendly. Found the airport fairly passenger friendly easy to find way out with good signage everywhere.,8,1
brussels-zaventem-airport,M McManus,United Kingdom,Been through this airport literally hundreds of times in my working life. There are two terminals; terminal A serves flights within the Schengen zone terminal B serves those outside. Terminal B takes slightly longer to get through as there are passport inspections before you are allowed to pass through to security. Terminal A only needs you to swipe your boarding pass on a scanner but it is a surprisingly long walk from the entrance of Terminal A to the gates. Both terminals have a decent choice of cafes and restaurants although the best restaurants are before you go through security you'll find them on the food court on level 3. There is wifi but you need to buy a scratch card with a password to use it. There are yellow vending machines security side selling them. Be warned that the shuttle buses (number 12 and 21) don't take you to the city centre they go to the European institutions which are a couple of miles south east of the city centre. Shuttle bus journeys are €5 one way or ten journeys for €25 which makes a lot of sense if you use it a lot. If you want a cheap way to the centre the SNCB train on level minus 1 will take you to Gare Centrale for about €7. A taxi is around €40.,7,1
brussels-zaventem-airport,Azlan Hashim,Malaysia,I arrived from Warsaw in the evening on 12th September. The airport was having peak hours with many arrivals and departures at the same time. However it was easy to navigate around the airport due to clear and good signages. It was a long walk from the aircraft however luggage was on the belt when we arrived at the luggage claim area. The train service to and from the airport was good where I was in the city less than 90 minutes from the time we landed.,6,1
brussels-zaventem-airport,P Berkers,Belgium,Used this airport on the 4th of August for my trip to Bangkok via Istanbul. The 18.15 departure to Istanbul. Check-in was very busy but the line moved quickly and the check-in agent was friendly. Passport control and security at terminal B (non Schengen) was very fast with friendly officers. The flight was boarded in zones and this was enforced. Passengers in an other boarding zone were not allowed to go to the plane until the passengers from the announced boarding zone were boarded. The return on the 25th of August at 21.35 was smooth. No lines at immigration and when we reached the luggage reclaim the bags were already coming to the carrousel. Clean airport with nice and friendly airport staff. At terminal B there were a lots of shops after passport control and before security. And after security there was also a bar and Duty Free shop.,9,1
brussels-zaventem-airport,A Gleck,Belgium,Landed tonight one of the last flights. Waited for 30 minutes for a gate agent to get the jetway so we could leave the plane. You may as well fly to Antwerp and walk to Brussels given how far Terminal A is from the exit. You'd think they would have put in a train or shuttle. Nope. Why do something that would add to the customer experience? Never check your bags at BRU or you will be over an hour before you get out. In short the ground staff are next to useless the design of the terminals is daft and often requires a hiking expedition to get to your flight and the customer service is often profoundly rude bordering on incompetent.,4,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,Susan Moore,United Kingdom,Security queues can be long here at busy times with only some of the lines open. Apart from that its an efficient airport except that the distances involves can be large. Be especially careful if you are transferring from the A gates to B gates as the distance between is long (I would allow 45 mins just to get from one gate to the other).,7,1
brussels-zaventem-airport,Peter Cullen,United Kingdom,In the summer I wrote a review criticising two aspect of Brussels airport; I was there again this week and both have been addressed. Buses from remote aircraft parking spots now stop closer to the passport checkpoint and they have opened a new larger ticket office for train tickets. Arriving and departing Brussels this week was a painless process. There was 5 minute queue to clear security but I have waited far longer at other airports and the staff are always efficient and polite. I feel Brussels is generally one of the better major European airports.,8,1
brussels-zaventem-airport,W Jensen,Norway,Horrible airport long queues no signs telling you where to go. The toilet facilities are quite bad. I was in the passport-queue for 45 minutes. I had quite a lot of hand luggage and I couldn't find a single hand luggage cart! To top it all you have to pay for the liquid gel bags? Very inefficient and hostile airport.,2,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,P Hartmann,Switzerland,This is one of the most inefficient airports. This airport is not really adapted for internal European flights. For a 1 hr flight you need to walk at least 15 minutes before having a chance to reach the exit and if by misfortune you had checked in bags then you won't be out of the airport in less than 30 mins minimum.,4,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,Amit Sharma,Switzerland,DEL-BRU-GVA. Arrived on a Jet airways flight. Landed at T-B onward connection to Geneva from T-1 Brussels Airlines. I am a Swiss Citizens so didn't have to go through the non-EU passport control long queue. Got to the Security check and as expected long queue there. Finally boarded my flight to Geneva with few minutes to spare. I can assure you that if I was a non-EU citizen my flight would have left.,5,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,O Maldonado,Guatemala,"Although it's becoming an important European hub Zaventem airport still keep a ""human"" size and moving between and within terminals is quite easy.

brussels-zaventem-airport,Ed Verhaeven,Canada,BRU is easy to get around and walking distances were short. Luggage took a bit longer to be unloaded on arrival but otherwise no complaints. We arrived at about 7.30 am for our return flight to Canada and virtually skipped through security. One negative at least as far as I could see - on arrival at the airport we were looking forward to a relaxed breakfast before our flight however there were no sit down restaurants within sight of our departure gate.,4,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,Hans Van Gaever,Belgium,This airport gives me a nice home-feel not too big and overcrowded and yet all the services one needs (shops lounges). Security lines can be long at rush hour but not exaggerated.,4,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,Kris Chavatte,Switzerland,Pleasant airport lots of shops and restaurants bit overpriced. Lounges are too small always overcrowded. Airport is clean but not spotless (room for improvement) and you need to walk a lot to get to your gate. The A terminal is 1km in length and it takes about 15min to get there from the main entrance building. The luggage control is over crowded too.,4,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,M Masters,United Arab Emirates,BRU is quite inefficient. The design of the airport maximises transfer times due to large distances and a design combining multiple walkways and escalators. It took us more than 10mins to walk to the passport control from our flight gate. Several passport control desks seemed to be unmanned resulting in a wait of approx 90 mins to clear it. The only advantage of an almost 2hr transit between the flight landing and baggage collection was that the baggage was on the carousal when we arrived there. Upon arriving at the train station at the airport we had to wait approx 15 mins to be served as only 2 counters were open. During departure via Brussels airlines we had to wait 45mins to drop off our bags (checked-in at the airport kiosk) which is probably not the airports fault. However the long walks and 20mins for security check definitely are. Strong advice - please arrive at this airport at least 2hrs prior to departure esp if flying Brussels airlines.,2,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,Peter Cullen,United Kingdom,I have used Brussels 4-6 times a year for about 20 years. Generally it is a well-organised easy to use airport with good facilities. However two things are very irritating and both could be improved at little cost. Firstly if one arrives from a non-Schengen state and the aircraft is parked in a remote spot (as is often the case) you are taken by bus to the terminal. This is fine except the bus drops passengers at a door that is a good 200m from the immigration control point so a rush of people up the stairs and along a very long corridor develops. Why not simply drop everyone closer to the passport check point - there appear to be doors already in place? Secondly there is a train into the centre of the city: frequent regular and efficient. As usual there were two sales points open and queues stretched out of the booking hall.,4,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,G Jacobs,Belgium,Has no electricity connectors foreseen for visitors of other countries. Waiting on your luggage becomes longer and longer every month. In the beginning luggage took around 15mins to claim now you have to wait around 45-60 mins.,4,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,Thomas Hoeh,Germany,Well organized airport with GOOD security checks. Queues are well organized processing is speedy with helpful attendants. Good selection of shops and food-outlets once you are through security. Restaurants fairly priced and courteous staff. Good selection of authentic Belgian products at competitive prices.,5,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,F Paapes,Netherlands,Flew several times to/from BRU. Generally positive experience. Last time efficient check-in quick passport and smooth security (though it wasn't anything near rush hour). The walk to the gate saves you time in a gym; three escalators down a long walk three escalators up. Transport to the city and the rest of the county is efficient but is thin especially in the late hours.,4,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,D Piot,Belgium,I use Brussels Airport every time so on average 20 times a year. It's very easy to reach by public transport and by car (there were some rush hour queues when the infrastructure was being rebuilt but that's finished now) very difficult to find a parking space close to the terminal on busy days. Kiss and ride zone works very efficiently when Police are patrolling without Police it's chaos because people leave their car parked. In 90% of the times never had to wait more than 30 minutes for checking in (I don't bother checking in online or using the machines) Staff is usually very friendly and they know multiple languages. Security can be really bad on some days so expect long queues. Again in about 80% of the time got through in less than half an hour. Terminal A is modern very spacious and very nice to be in but about 15 minutes of walking from the check-in area. Terminal B is older but does not look aged less shops and less seating. Baggage drop off was very efficient my luggage would be waiting on the belt but that's changed after some worker strikes. Expect 20-30 minutes of wait (when you arrive at the belt which is also about 20 minutes after arrival at the gate).,5,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,J Segal,United States,Transited BRU earlier this month. Total chaos. Landed from MXP in terminal B long walk to terminal A for connecting flight to PHL. Passport control not bad but as heading up stairs to get to security was faced with a sea of people coming down the stairs. Seems main security checkpoint was overloaded and they were directing people to use alternate at far end of A terminal. Had to walk to end of terminal where there was a mass of people queuing for 2 checkpoints. 45 minutes through then up to departures and back to the other end of the terminal to the gate. Very little to look at air side no food nor shopping this was mainly pre security as was duty free kiosk so could not get that stamped forfeiting the refund. Not the best experience.,3,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,D Stanley,United Kingdom,I have never had a good experience at Brussels Airport. Travelling to Africa via Brussels makes you feel like a third class citizen (whatever your skin colour). You are almost forced into using a transfer bus from a virtually unheated part of the airport. If you can find another way to Africa that does not involve passing through Brussels take it.,2,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,Mike Sellick,United Kingdom,Flew from the UK to Oslo via Brussels Airport return. Signage and directions were extremely confusing and the security staff were rude and arrogant. I don't know how old the Airport is but the facilities were dated and unclean.,1,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,Alain Kupferman,France,Clean easy to access at low price from city centre by train. Confusing in the check-in zone but once you pass security fantastic shopping plenty of space to sit good indications and long distances so enough time is needed to join the flights to Africa.,5,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,A Swamy,,BOM-BRU-CDG. Transit through BRU on Jet Airways. Landed at 0750 at concourse B with onward flight to CDG at 0940 from concourse A. After a long walk through concourse B reached passport control. 4 counters operating for non EU citizens with more than 200 people in line. Took an agonizing 1 hour and 10 min to clear. Again a long walk to reach concourse A. Security check took another 10 min. Had to rush to my gate to avoid missing the flight and reached just 2 minutes before scheduled departure time. No clear or enough directions to reach the gates. I guess the airlines are used to it and they waited for an additional 15-20 minutes for passengers who were stuck in the BRU maze. Please avoid transiting through BRU if you can or allow at least 3 hours to transit.,2,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,E Etsion,,Access to and from the airport is easy by car or rail. If you arrive too early for check in there is no seating so either be prepared to stand or come a bit later. Security checks can be tiring - depending of course on how many people are waiting in line. Was not required to take off shoes since they have a new machine that you simply stand on. I was however required to take off my belt and every once in about three times I used this airport was body searched as well. Once you go through all the hassle it gets more calm there is usually enough seating and the waiting is OK. All in all a clean and efficient airport. The only really bother: you may have a very long walk from arrival gate to passport control since the terminal is a long corridor. If you're lucky you will land closer to the terminal.,4,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,C Chouleur,,I used to like travelling through Brussels Airport : not anymore ! The few last month the airport experience has turned from pleasant to very anoying due to the lack of staff . Lack of staff at check in with Brussels airlines : the airline is trying to force everybody to check on line and the result is long queues at the airport. Lack of staff at boarding pass control : another line before getting to the terminal. Lack of staff at security where now you have to take off shoes every time with rude and bored staff and queues getting longer each month. Altogether a very bad experience and no time left to spend some time and money in the shops.,2,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,E Nylund,,Cool modern design and lots of space to sit. I arrived in BRU too early and thus had a long wait for my flight and found you have to pay for the wireless internet. No entertainment thus. The free charging stations for your laptop/cell phone were useful though. Toilets clean (despite someone had been smoking in there). What I really found annoying was the journey to the luggage claim up and down escalators and long corridors. I also didn't realize the exit was in the middle of the luggage claim area and not in the end and thus wandered around looking a bit lost. There was also no mailbox after the security check - I forgot to mail my postcards before going in. The maps claimed there should've been one but I really couldn't find it. Rail connection to Brussels ok railway station sterile and boring.,4,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,S Sivaraman,,Good airport I have used it a few times nice and clean. Never really had the chance to check duty free though. But be prepared to walk and I mean really walk 3 floors down and then under the park bays (?) and 3 floors up. The designer should have been a health freak.. the last thing I want when rushing to meetings is a 20 minute jog to exit an airport!,3,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,J Bertani,,Terminal A is a dreadful place where one can easily got lost. When arriving there's an endless walk to the exit with escalators up and down and miles of moving walkways with few and confusing signs in this shopping of an airport. Finding the train station is quite a challenge too. The automatic tickets vending machines only accept Belgium cards. On the positive side it's a clean place full of natural light but designed by someone who never use airports!,3,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,Matt Ray,,Nice airport but they do love their escalators don't they? There is one after another to go anywhere. It is almost comical. I had heard about this but seeing it in person made me laugh. Grab a piece of chocolate to keep your energy up!,4,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,Paul Jacobsen,,Terminal A for Schengen flights is quite comfortable with much natural daylight and plenty of seating areas. But it is quite a long walk to the baggage claim area using numerous escalators. Catering is good and reasonably priced. Trains to downtown Brussels run every 20min and are cheap. Please note that the ticket vending machines accept Euro coins only and no credit cards. Signals in the check-in halls could be improved as it is rather difficult to locate the right counter.,4,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,Barry Byrne,,Very long queues for security tonight in zone B in Brussels. At least a 400m queue to reach the scanners it started just after the passport check desks and it was slow moving. This did not seem to have any obvious cause. With the mega long walks you can have here a good reason to be prudent.,3,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,Christophe Chouleur,,Brussels Airport is convenient and most of the time easy to travel through. Bright and airy the Shengen terminal is much better than the older one and also offers more opportunities for shopping. Recently longs queues for security have appeared and the airport management should find a solution to this problem.,4,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,Erich Koller,,BRU Zaventem Airport has made significant improvements over the last couple of years. I was in and out of this airport almost monthly for 4 years and despite most often using the rather old B concourse they have not only built additional gates but also invested in some upgrades. Arrival is still a bit odd with long walks from gate to immigration counters in concourse B and with sometimes long queues. However airport staff is friendly and security is strict but done in a friendly manner. Overall a 3 to 4 stars in Europe. With improved intercontinental connections and one of the best intra-Europe network this airport has good potential to become even better and more attractive to travellers.,3,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,Mark St-Amour,,I use Brussels airport a lot and it is a good airport which has got better over the past couple of years. The cafes are good and not too expensive when compared with places like Heathrow. The train service should be improved though as it only accepts Belgian debit cards and normally only 1 machine works. As everyone is coming from abroad this doesn't make much sense.,4,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,N Barnsley,,A well run and well maintained airport with friendly and efficient staff. Frequent and reasonably priced train link into central Brussels. Didn't use the shops or catering so can't comment there. If your flight comes in at the far end of pier A then you're in for quite a hike to the train station/taxi pick up and the signing seems to fizzle out towards the end but otherwise a very good experience.,4,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,Matthew Ross,,"The negative aspects are high prices in restaurants and car parking. Although there is a single terminal there are two departure areas - ""A"" for Schengen zone countries (i.e. no passport controls) and ""B"" for non-Schengen (including the UK and Ireland). Passengers travelling through area ""B"" have a far shorter walk to/from the 'planes. Flights occasionally arrive at area ""A"" from non-Schengen countries - this is usually when bus transfers are necessary (so that passengers have to pass through passport control). A good recent development are the direct trains from the airport to Leuven as well as Brussels. A little known bus link is the hourly De Lijn service 359 to/from Roodebeek Metro station - useful for the east side of Brussels.",4,0
brussels-zaventem-airport,Hugh Dow,,Zaventem is good clean and friendly. The food is pricey. The train connection is excellent but the taxis are a crude rip off. We are stuck with the never-ending tunnel to terminal A but the terminal is nice when you get there. Do something about people parking on the forecourt. And bussing when you land is hateful time consuming and stressful.,4,0
bucharest-otopeni-airport,M Cristea,Romania,"Improvement in cleanliness and staff. Smooth process for drop-off, security, frontier and boarding, fast baggage on belt at return. Smokers friendly airport. The food/ drinks in restaurants are expensive for Romanian standards, at least. ",8,1
bucharest-otopeni-airport,P Beal,United Kingdom,"Nearly missed my plane, in spite of arriving at airport in good time. One of two Security Gates has to be chosen according to designated Departure Gate, but latter is not shown on screen in Departures Hall. Security itself was chaotic. I was ordered into a queue which took more than twenty-five minutes just to reach the scanning equipment (one man was observing two scanners at once). After my laptop was scanned, I was told to start it up and then turn it off, meaning even more time was lost. Passport control was slow: in total it took more than thirty-five minutes between entering security and entering the departure lounge, by which time my flight was closing.",1,0
bucharest-otopeni-airport,D Vogt,Netherlands,We transferred from a TAROM flight to KLM and our experience was smooth. The facilities airside are two folded the last part of the pier with our boarding gate (12) was looking nice and modern the first part looked bit shabby and worn down seen the economic reality in Romania it was high standard. I can't make any statement about the landside but the transfer security was lacking proper English skills and it was hard to communicate and get what they wanted which gives you the impression that these people are rude. In fact they aren't if you look into their body language as well.,7,1
bucharest-otopeni-airport,Annette Cox,United States,The worst airport I have been to. Early morning flight and airport was very busy. Several kiosks were not working and only one person there to help. She was very rude and not trying to help. Everyone kept telling us to go to someone else for help with boarding pass but could never talk to anyone. No one seemed to care that a large group of us were having a problem getting boarding passes. Lines for security were chaos. No one directing people and everyone just pushing in together. Terrible experience.,,0
bucharest-otopeni-airport,Tara Jakobson,Greece,Quick friendly security screening. Short lines at passport control. However smoking areas not well controlled and was forced to breathe second hand smoke for 40 minutes sitting at my gate waiting to board my flight. I travel a lot and this is the only airport in the 15 or so years where I have ever experienced this.,,0
bucharest-otopeni-airport,Mike Jacques,United Kingdom,A good airport. Very quickly through security which was staffed by polite people. Passport control queues small and staff dealt with all nationalities in a polite manner. Signs throughout the airport were found to be well positioned and also displayed in English. Over-all this a good airport.,9,1
bucharest-otopeni-airport,N Ardan,Belgium,Excellent airport very large friendly staff beats airports in France or Italy.,10,1
bucharest-otopeni-airport,Martina Petrova,Bulgaria,In general it is a normal airport. There are some shops places to sit etc. bathrooms are relatively clean. However I faced huge issues when I had to use the parking facilities. There is no gratis period for a car to come in and just pick you up for a very short period. This is very inappropriate because afterwards the only way to pay is in the local currency. EUR is not accepted anywhere and the exchange rates are very unfavorable. Moreover they did not accept to exchange small money (in my case 10 EUR). This caused a huge inconvenience for me and I have to say that the staff was not friendly either. I am definitely not keen on coming to this airport again!,1,0
bucharest-otopeni-airport,BP Cullen,United Kingdom,It was not particularly busy when I arrived and departed but I felt Bucharest was one of the best airport experiences I have had in years. Apart from a short wait to check-in there were no queues anywhere and staff were courteous and friendly throughout. There is plentiful seating and a range of different food outlets (admittedly many selling similar food) and shops. A cheap alternative to a taxi is to use the bus into the city about every 20 minutes and a return ticket costs about 2 euros.,8,1
bucharest-otopeni-airport,B Rockwell,United States,We started coming through here in December 2000. It's gone a long ways to finish what they started in the last 13 years but obviously by the other reviews still have a long ways to go in the pre-security departure lounge. However Lavazza is a nice touch because unlike the Starbucks model in which you have to help yourself and clean up your own mess the Lavazza is fastidiously serviced by wait staff who are very polite and attentive.,8,1
bucharest-otopeni-airport,Sam Hus,United Kingdom,All the people I encountered in this Airport were friendly. It's not what I would say in the league of Singapore's Changi but nevertheless functional in design. Anyone though who has to spend more than 2 hours in the airport would be surely bored. Dining facilities are poor with the same saturated fat selection's. Taxi Fare to the airport from Bucharest Centre should be no more than 30 Leu. Avoid the taxi louts in arrivals or anyone who approaches offering this and that as you would anywhere. They will cost you a small fortune.,5,1
bucharest-otopeni-airport,Emiliano Morchi,Italy,OTP in fact is two airports in one. The check-in hall the security controls and the passport control areas are old overcrowded messy and do not meet European standards. Once surviving this the departure hall is new and nice with many shops and bars. Especially in the morning it is suggested to arrive pretty early in order to get through the x-ray and passport controls: the queue is totally unorganized time consuming and stressful.,6,0
bucharest-otopeni-airport,Marc Guillemard,France,"Transferred in Bucharest coming from Paris to Oradea. OTP is a small airport quite modern. The issue is that I landed ""International"" in the new terminal had to walk (in a hurry because my transfer was tight) to the old domestic terminal to get my boarding card to find that the door was in fact at the new international terminal and walk back all the way! As there was only 1 line of luggage/passengers inspection open and not very fast that was really limit and I was lucky to board the bus on time. On the way back had some time to spend and could have a nice espresso and pastry in one of the bars. The international terminal is modern and clean but do not expect the facilities and free-tax of Singapore this is just a ""regional"" airport.",7,1
bucharest-otopeni-airport,Nigel Stacey,United Kingdom,Well having recently traveled through Henri Coanda airport I found that there is not much before you go through security but when you are there is quite a few shops although for some unknown reason in duty free they will not accept the local currency which is the first airport I have come across that does not. In the international terminal is the Oasis self service restaurant I went to purchase a couple of drinks and I only had a couple of 100 Lei notes left the girl on the checkout went round other staff checking it was okay and not a forgery it was simply an unused note I was then asked to pay by card. I took the note back and changed it at a money exchange with no problem whatsoever and returned to pay for my drinks. When in the queue a passport control officer paid for his drink with no problem and when I mentioned it he was so rude but as I was going to go through to depart what can I say would I use this restaurant again definitely not. Would I return to Bucharest again probably not.,7,1
bucharest-otopeni-airport,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,The usual mix of rude staff expensive food and poor signage. Not enough shops for a capital city airport.,4,0
bucharest-otopeni-airport,C Roberts,United Kingdom,One of the best small airports in Europe. You get in and out quickly and the addition of the new terminal still keeps it efficient. Staff are not overly friendly. Lines are short and there may not be a lot to do but that's fine since you never spend long here. Traffic to the centre is much improved but watch out for the taxi touts outside baggage claim.,9,1
bucharest-otopeni-airport,L Wells,United Kingdom,I travel regularly to Bucharest and have been impressed by improvements made to this airport. It is clean directions are well signposted. If you use public transport it is cheap to travel into the City Centre by train or bus. The airport taxis are ok but watch out for taxi touts. To date I have had no problems with luggage on any of my trips through this airport and have had only friendly and efficient treatment by check-in and other staff. Coffee is expensive in the coffee bars though there are some coffee machines . Most facilities can be found here and security is clearly on view.,9,1
bucharest-otopeni-airport,A Balas,United States,I was positively surprised by the changes that occurred in Henri Coanda Airport in Bucharest. Now it has a new terminal over 40 gates I believe and the duty free is actually open and it works. It still does not accept payment in Romanian Lei (only $US and Euros and potentially credit cards). It does look like a nice airport terminal now once you do the check-in. Before check-in it's still outdated.,4,0
bucharest-otopeni-airport,Patrick Curren,United States,I connected through OTP from Istanbul to Venice on TAROM. After disembarking all our plane's passengers were made to wait in a hallway unable to enter the main terminal for about half an hour. The guard in charge clearly did not know what to do with anyone. At length someone else showed up and simply opened a door letting everyone enter the terminal not requiring any documents. The gate for our connecting flight to Venice was changed several times -- each time with no notice. The only way passengers knew there had been a change was if they happened to look at the departure board and saw that the gate was different. I found OTP to be decades behind the rest of the world.,1,0
bucharest-otopeni-airport,R Wezeman,Netherlands,Arrival at Bucharest Baneasa awful experience. Building is too small to accommodate all arriving passengers. Departures are even worse shady unorganized looking terminal. Security check takes forever and is an inefficient process. Waiting area at the gates too small too accommodate passengers of one flight let alone if 2 flights leave at about the same time.,2,0
bucharest-otopeni-airport,M Guillemard,,Arrived from Paris to Bucharest OTP. The Tarom plane was allowed direct access. Quite a long walk until you get to the passport control that went quick with Police Officers that have improved a lot since the past days. We were waiting at belt 1 for the luggage as shown on the screen when somebody noticed that our flight was no longer on this screen ! It had been moved to an other belt without notice. 2 days later flew from OTP to Cluj (internal flight) - check- in was quick and efficient waiting-room much too small with not enough seats boarding by bus. All in all not HKG or Singapore but better than some other European airports.,3,0
bucharest-otopeni-airport,Leonard Wells,,I was impressed by the speed of immigration on arrival and received a nice welcome from the officer checking my passport. Customs ignored me and I was out in less than 8 minutes in total. The bus journey into the city centre was -as everyone says- a nightmare. The only way to avoid it is to arrive late in the evening and take a taxi. The departure was different. There does not seem to be room for a queue and if you don't speak Romanian it can be hard to check if you are in the correct queue. Nevertheless it was all fairly friendly and I have seen worse at Heathrow!,4,0
bucharest-otopeni-airport,Maria Ionita,,Although it's only about 10 miles away from Bucharest traffic to and from the airport is a nightmare: depending on the time of day it takes anywhere from 2 to 4 hours to get there (also beware of incredible rip-offs with the taxis; best arrange for someone to pick you up/drive you there). The new layout in the Departures terminal means that check-in security screening and passport control move much faster now. There is plenty of space to sit down and stroll in the lounges ok shopping as well as smoking areas. Arrivals is still in some need of improvement: if you deplane via bus (which seems to be the rule rather than the exception) you have to climb two storeys on an incredibly narrow spiral staircase (and it can be quite difficult especially with a heavy carry-on or a stroller; do not count on the elevators working). Luggage arrives quite quickly. But the biggest problems at Otopeni are the state of the lavatories and price gouging. The lavatories are without exception filthy: nobody seems to bother cleaning them very often toilet paper and soap are frequently missing and they also appear to double as smoking areas for the custodial staff. Price gouging is epic: a small water or Coke is over 3 Euros beer and coffee are pushing 5 Euros. Same goes for the dismal snacks. In short it's a terrible place for a long layover but an ok one if you only have one or 2 hours to kill.,2,0
bucharest-otopeni-airport,James Duckworth,,Immigration quickly cleared and baggage quickly appeared. Travel into the city is a nightmare - the road network is wholly inadequate for a developing city. Check in for returning flight was quick with no queue but then very long wait at security probably due to heightened measures ahead of the NATO summit. Departure lounge comfortable if slightly basic but all outlets food and non-food very expensive. Range of food on offer very restricted - OK for a snack but not more (even if you could afford it). All outlets will accept EUR but do not seem to have change.,3,0
bucharest-otopeni-airport,Robert Bush by,,There are separate buildings for arrivals and departures. Arrived on easyjet (although they may be switching to Banesca which is altogether the poorer relation of the two airports serving Bucharest). Bussed to the terminal from the aircraft and immigration was swift as was baggage retrieval. Once outside I recommend you press on through the throng of taxi touts and either take the bus into town or a grab Fly Taxi cab and they will be at the head of the rank where their supervisor will get you organized. The meter only ticks when you are moving which is just as well as traffic can be heavy. There are cheaper and just as honest taxis but they either have to be phoned for or you need to seek them out at arrivals. Departing was a breeze security was pleasant but extremely thorough. Once through the formalities the shops are outrageously expensive compared to down town and whilst prices are displayed in euro local lei are readily accepted in the handful of cafes. Overall Otopeni is a small not very busy and clean facility surrounded by acres of apron and runway.,3,0
bucharest-otopeni-airport,C Roberts,,A surprisingly good airport in terms of efficiency. While check-in is becoming a bit more chaotic and takes longer due to increased traffic it still has one of the quickest check-in times for an airport in Europe. Arrivals are usually a breeze. I think the longest I've had to wait at passport control is 5 minutes and the longest for baggage 15 minutes. The building and services are in need of an upgrade but that's OK with me since it's easy to spend a minimum amount of time at the airport.,4,0
bucharest-otopeni-airport,A Elbaloula,,Overall a clean airport transfer from domestic to international flights very quick and bus connection very convenient. Airport personnel not smiling customs officers rude and do not speak English still not used to accept EEA/EU ID Cards and mix them up with other non-EU nationalities compared to Sofia Airport customs for example. A big smile is needed even if you are a customs airport officer to leave the country with a good impression.,2,0
bucharest-otopeni-airport,Rob Weeks,,Modern but quite small airport. Security and baggage efficient and quite quick. Travel between airport and city is horrendously slow - the road just can't handle the weekday traffic volume.,3,0
bucharest-otopeni-airport,Peter Cartledge,,A rather small but clean new airport with modern facilities a good business lounge. Quite a number of shops which I didn't use; a previous report described them as expensive but all a/port shops are. Check-in was rather awkward because the area is rather small not much room for queues and already despite its newness can get very crowded. This could be a problem in future as Romania develops particularly as the other airport in Bucharest has now virtually closed. Passport control and customs are quick and efficient and stress free on a European Union passport. Baggage handling also OK.,4,0
bucharest-otopeni-airport,Tony Maddern,,Bucharest airport serves it's purpose but it's nothing too exciting. Food outlets are very limited and overpriced there are also some overpriced shops in the departures area. It is a fairly small airport so moving through the airport is quick and easy. Transfers between Bucharest City and the This airport take about 20 - 45 mins. There are 2 methods of public transport between the city and airport. A bus which takes 40mins to 1 hour or a taxi which will cost about £3.00 - £6.00 or £8.00 if you get ripped off. Fly taxi is the only taxi company allowed to take passengers from the airport and their taxis charge twice the rate of the other taxi companies. I felt that it was worth me taking the time to provide this piece of information as there has been nothing written since last September so I hope that it is published and useful to others.,,0
bucharest-otopeni-airport,Matthew Ross,,This is now a good clean modern and efficient airport - a pleasant surprise. When recently departing the airport seemed almost deserted so there is clearly room for a considerable increase in traffic. In short this could and should be a regional hub airport. In common with much of Eastern Europe smoking restrictions are less than in the West. I cannot comment on public transport access as I was collected by car. Traffic to/from the city centre can be busy (and some pretty erratic driving can be observed) so allow plenty of time.,,0
bucharest-otopeni-airport,Graham Rothwell,,I've use the airport several times over the last 8 years and have found a great improvement in it service. it's still not up to English standard but considering it past I feel it's doing very well with most of the facilities are friendly accessible and comparable and better in price to ours in England. Prices may fluctuate but there no worse than the very very high prices we can pay in our country if we allow the airports to rip us off.,,0
bucharest-otopeni-airport,Nikolaus Rieskamp,,The international airport at Otopeni has the international standard and is quite comfortable for a Romanian point of view. The building is clean and the ways are short as the airport is quite small. The weak points are the rude agents at the buffets in the departure hall and especially the rip-off taxi-drivers who wait for arriving passengers. It is recommended to hold the luggage firmly in the hands to avoid it getting loaded in the taxi faster than you can watch. Always negotiate the fare before entering/loading the taxi. Never pay more than 400.000 Romanian LEI (11 EURO) for Bucharest-City-Centre ! Normally they demand 600.000 LEI or even more. Avoid paying in Euro there are cash-dispensers and changing counters in the arrival hall. There is a good bus-link to the city (nr. 783) for only 10% of the taxi-price (37.000 LEI) that leaves every 30 minutes. Departure is downstairs in the arrival hall (no signs!) the stairs are close to the exits. Tickets must be purchased before boarding the bus in a nearly invisible shop-box outside of the building.,,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,A Allen,United States,"Arriving at the airport at 4 a.m., we entered to check in, check our baggage. We saw one massive mob in front of the KLM counter area going all the way back to the entrance doors. The small, designated line for baggage drop off and boarding pass printing kiosks were not visible. No signage available. We asked a person in line where to start. They pointed to where the boarding pass kiosks were located. There were no crowd control stanchions to designate a line in front of each kiosk. Having no choice, we joined the mob slowly forcing their way towards the kiosks. 25 minutes later, we reached a kiosk. Check in process was slowed by long response times by the kiosk. After scanning our passports, later on we were asked if we had our passport. Really? Kiosk didn't know it had already scanned it. (What we were not told by our travel company, Viking, was could we have avoided this hassle by printing our boarding pass at the hotel.) 4:40 a.m., boarding passes in hand, we joined the other mob moving forward slowly to access a very short line with crowd control stanchions. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 6:10 a.m., would we make it? I got the impression the airport didn’t have a clue about crowd control, how to use more crowd control stanchions to manage long lines. At 5:20 a.m. we had our bags checked, headed to the security lines. Was shocked to see the security section had crowd control stanchions to manage long lines. Guessing the airport manager has never seen this, never actually gone on the land side the airport. Passing through security, we go right into a fancy, spacious, shopping area. Wow. Going through we reach the area to access departure gates. Was amazed at all the open space for retail sales, shops everywhere, no problem finding space for display racks, etc. No professional management, no crowd control, nothing. Airport managers must only live and work on the airside, never seeing the hassle passengers must go through. Best way to see the Budapest airport is from your plane's window as you fly out to the modern world.",2,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,D Simon,United Kingdom,Flying in was fantastic quickly through passport control but had to wait 50 minutes for our baggage. Terminal 2B is modern efficient and has great facilities. Oh how I miss T1 with its old world charm. Flying out was strenuous and a long process. Although we had checked in online we still had to queue for over an hour to get our bags checked leaving very little time to go through the ergonomically bad security again after a long wait. Still as typically Hungarian all staff are extremely polite and helpful. It was the amount of times we had to present our travel documents that become irritating. Hopefully the next time I fly into Ferihegy I will be staying in Hungary permanently.,6,1
budapest-ferihegy-airport,D Vogt,Netherlands,Ferighegy Airport is a quite efficient clearly signed airport. On our arrival from Amsterdam we were directed to an escalator about 25 meters away from our arrival gate and within 20 minutes we were out of the airport and on our way to our Hotel. Seamless experience there. Leaving Budapest towards Bucharest with TAROM was a smooth experience as well the SkyPriority counters were completely free and we were checked in in a matter of minutes. As they were very strict with the FastTrack we chose for the standard lane as my wife has no Priority status and we did not want to separate there but the queue on this busy 8am was short and efficient and within a small 8-10 minutes we were security cleared. Another few steps in the terminal to the non-schengen departures which were deserted at the time of our departure. The boarding process via the bus (it was a small commuter plane) was less orderly there was a priority section in the bus but which was not enforced so the run to the plane was opened as soon as the bus opened it's doors. Further up for the smoker the cigarette prices are highly competitive and you can take two cartons when travelling within the EU per person.,8,1
budapest-ferihegy-airport,Neill Campbell,United Kingdom,Everything seemed to run pretty smoothly here and baggage arrived quickly. The handlers were quite efficient at getting missing bag to me after it arrived on the next flight. Departing there was about a 20 min queue at the Lufthansa check in but security was quite quick.,9,1
budapest-ferihegy-airport,Zdenek Foukal,Czech Republic,Travel here quite often. WIFI used to be unusable at all but things are progressing. The queueing is usually fast but you bet your shoes or only metal glasses will beep - most sensitive metal detector on earth. Personnel generally not pleasant given by culture. Forgot phone once on board nobody bothered much to help me and nobody ever called back despite they promised etc. From service point still lot to learn.,3,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,James Lobont,United Kingdom,Great. Extremely clean facilities great food and great observation tower. The only minor blip was the queuing which took a while but its what I suspected would happen. Great airport would fly from there again.,10,1
budapest-ferihegy-airport,L Fodor,Hungary,"The airport terminal 2B is now comfortable and check in desks satisfactory. The worst thing is the long walk through a covered way but open to the elements so you can get soaked if wind and raining. You then have to stand for such a long time (once over an hour) in the ""cattle sheds"" which are baking hot in summer and your plane hasn't even arrived at airport. Once in this shed there are no toilet facilities or any seating. Hopefully this situation will be improved in near future.",5,1
budapest-ferihegy-airport,Roman Temnenko,Ukraine,When departing from here arrive 3+ hours before boarding - only one baggage wrapping point was available - we spent 30 minutes in the queue and could only pay by cash. No signage for the ATMs. Security lines were understaffed. There were only 4 safety lines working and it was very inconvenient to put on shoes after security check without a seat. Immigration was slow due to IT system problems. The rest of airport facilities we used like baggage drop-off overall air-conditioning cleanliness customs for tax refund the tax refund itself duty free shops were as expected. So in general the airport was rather a nervous disappointment - can do better.,5,1
budapest-ferihegy-airport,A Milossavlevich,Ukraine,The airport is very small and cramped. Terminal 2 is divided in two parts making it really small and uncomfortable. Queues are huge both at check-in and security. If not for the Skycourt after security and the maze-like duty-free it would really be claustrophobic with the lack of daylight being a real nuisance. The link to the city is very poor. The bus / metro combination is both uncomfortable and expensive making it impossible for you to reach the city center without a transfer. The entire terminal has only one exchange booth but most appalling wasn't their scarcity but the rate they're charging which was nothing short of a scam - welcome to Europe. Coming from Ukraine (IEV) the contrast was even more evident. Toilets weren't clean broken faucets soap lacking in many. Next - the Wi-Fi. BUD supposedly offers 2 hours of free Wi-Fi that is available once you get passed a lengthy security/rules agreement check-page that directs you then onto another useless page that given the speed takes ages to load. Even once passed those mandatory checkpoints the internet was still very slow and almost completely useless. Basically nothing good and I won't be looking forward to going back to the airport in the future. If not for the occasional offers to some places unserved from Belgrade (such as Kiev) it's really not worth the hassle.,2,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,J Martin,Australia,Worst airport in the world. No smoking area in an international airport? Come on! What a joke! Even better when your flight is delayed 4 hours and there is no possible way to exit and re enter the terminal. Ridiculous.,,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,John Penney,United Kingdom,The incoming flight (turn-around) was delayed by 1 hour due to technical problems and a replacement plane was used so our departure EasyJet flight (U28424) was also late to depart. This was an irritation but was not our main problem the problem was we were told on the electronic read outs that boarding had commenced only to walk a very long way to what was a metal out-building with no facilities no proper seating arrangement and as far as I could see no toilets and no air conditioning on a fairly hot day. We were forced to stand for some 30 minutes or more. The incoming flight had not touched down at this point. We stood there covered in sweat from the heat. As senior citizens we were not pleased with this arrangement. It was akin to herding cattle. This is the 21st century and Ferihegy were recently upgraded. Budapest Airport this should have been a better experience than this very poor! After complaining we received a well constructed (probably by a lawyer) standard letter more or less stating that this was the future low cost flying for keeping costs down for budget airlines. My interpretation is if you do not like it fly business class or at least book priority boarding. Not a good airport to fly budget anymore.,4,1
budapest-ferihegy-airport,Alexander Mokretsov,Russian Federation,A rather disappointing airport. A beautiful city like Budapest sure deserves better. Terrible queues at border control and check-in. Lack of good shops and restaurants. Too little ATMs and currency exchange points. The building itself is rather small with nothing else to do but to sit and wait for the flight. Granted there's a free 120-min. Wi-Fi. The road to the airport is not a highway but a very narrow local route with lots of traffic lights and traffic jams on the way. With so many tourists coming in to Hungary they sure need to make significant improvements otherwise if the number of passengers increases dramatically the airport would be paralysed.,4,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,Paul Harvey,United Kingdom,Flew in and out by Ryanair. Bussed to the terminal on arrival had to walk a long way to an out station shed for departure. Terminal is clean and modern worked very efficiently and has free WIFI. public transport too and from the airport is very efficient and cheap. I was very impressed.,10,1
budapest-ferihegy-airport,Sander van Kan,Netherlands,I flew to and from this airport with Wizz air. After landing at Budapest we taxied to our remote parking spot. We where bussed towards the terminal. After going to the toilet (which was clean) I was really surprised to see my bag already on the luggage belt. When it was time to return we went to terminal 2B. We dropped the bag at the bag drop off counter. We walked to the security point. Everything went quickly and smoothly (approx. 10 min). The airport had a very nice food court and all looks very modern and clean. My overall impression of Budapest Airport was very good!,8,1
budapest-ferihegy-airport,R Franz,Singapore,Good infrastructure bad management and poorly trained staff. Check-in doesn't open until exactly 2 hours before the flight (regardless of how empty the place is and/or how many passengers are waiting). Hand- luggage check is disorganized. All is over-sized and there is a lot of running around for nothing. Staff are too disinterested to change the lanes to fit the demand. Then there is the laughable shoes and belt off routine that has long been shown to be nonsense and abandoned by most airports. So overall keep the building get rid off the supervisors and start training the remaining employees.,,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,K Presti,Switzerland,Never seen anything like this. Passengers hauled into a tent to wait for boarding like cattle. No heating no sanitation. Shame on these people. I have a couple ideas for further improvements/cost saving: passengers should load their baggage onto the plane or passengers should push the plane on the runway.,,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,P Baer,Switzerland,"This is an interesting airport to say the least. We flew out of terminal 2B and it seems as though they ran out of money to completely renovate the entire terminal. Once past security where the bin helpers throw your bins onto the conveyor belt with no regards to what hand luggage you might be carrying you come upon a beautifully renovated terminal with nice seating areas and a good selection of restaurants. There is free wifi in the food court area and the bathrooms are pretty clean. But then you go to the gate area and its like you are going back to the 1970s. Even worse my gate did not have a ""real"" gate. We had to walk outside and then we were corralled into a big tent with only four pathetic heating lights in the entire thing. It's a real shame that the airport couldn't do a complete renovation of the terminal because it looked like it had so much potential to be nice.",2,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,J Rudge,United Kingdom,Terminal 2 takes all flights but has no rail link to Budapest meaning a long bus ride or pricey taxi is the only way to get there. Arriving was fine apart from a ridiculously long queue at immigration despite us arriving from an EU nation. Return - Check in was alright a long queue but it seemed to go down quickly. Queuing at security was a shambles took longer to pass the tiny security hall than it did to check in. Duty Free was alright and the skycourt upstairs for food and drink is brilliant. I have a huge problem with the way they board aircraft's here - boarding 3 Jet2 flights (Leeds Manchester Edinburgh) through the same gate at the same time? Was an absolute shambles. An hour before the flight was due to depart we were told we were boarding through the gate walked down the jetway onto the airport tarmac walked across and into what can only be described as a tent - with 3 queues for each flight. No toilet facilities and no seating just standing room only. Waited in a freezing cold damp tent for half an hour then the doors were opened and all 3 queues boarded 3 identical aircraft - what a shambles. People were boarding the wrong plane and because of it we left 30 minutes late but thankfully made up for it in flight. For the major international airport of a capital city of a European Country this was a shambles. I've flown to Greek Island airstrips and had a better experience.,3,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,B Evans,Hungary,Terminal 1 closed in early 2012. T2 now takes all flights. It was refurbished last year and is spacious well organised and light. There are lots of good food options on the second floor. Shops are ok but overpriced. The main problem is accessibility as T2 is not served by a railway connection (unlike T1). There is a taxi service but it is a little pricey.,8,1
budapest-ferihegy-airport,M McManus,United Kingdom,Airport has good bus links to city but you need to change at the end of the bus line onto the metro to finish your final leg to the city. No train link direct from airport. Bureau de Change always very busy so advisable to get your holiday money before you leave. Airport signage was slightly confusing (does an up arrow mean straight ahead or on the floor above?) but not to the point it would seriously disrupt you. Airport terminal 2B was well lit modern and had excellent facilities. Staff understood English well. In security lines very fast moving metal rolling bars move the trays along be warned.,7,1
budapest-ferihegy-airport,Tor Idar Larsen,Norway,Remember my stay here as smooth and a pleasure. Superb view of the airport from several spots which I appreciated. Ground crew put on viking helmets when the Norwegian Air Shuttle came in. Quite a small airport perhaps a bit too small which gives little options for food and other things you might want to purchase. Everything else; quick seemed efficient enough. Bit of a queue when checking in.,7,1
budapest-ferihegy-airport,Brian Hill,United Kingdom,Arrived late in the evening speed through border control didn't have to wait for our luggage. But departed on BA from Terminal 2B what a disaster; two low cost airlines checking in on adjacent desks meant the queues blocked access to both the toilets and the cafe. We had priority passes for the security but why did the staff insist I put our boarding cards through the X-ray machine? Don't rely on the signs they are really confusing and no two clocks told the same time. The one remaining executive lounge is next door to a derelict area which was once another lounge the one we used couldn't even provide ice for our G&Ts.,4,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,D Leston,United Kingdom,Terminal 1 is the designated low cost terminal catering for Wizzair easyjet Jet2 Germanwings and Norwegian. It is small but has been nicely refurbished and contains everything you could need as both an arriving or departing passenger. Plenty of refreshment outlets and even an outside viewing area overlooking the apron which is free to visit if you need to kill a bit of time while you wait for your flight. Overall a very nice experience.,9,1
budapest-ferihegy-airport,J Moffat,Latvia,Arrived at Terminal 2. Bags arrived very quickly. Taxi service to the centre is well organised fixed price (depending on zone) and not expensive (and discount card for fixed price back to the airport). Check-in on departure is well-organised and efficient. Boarding cards issued online or by machine at airport (with someone to help with machines) - the desks only receive baggage. We checked in online to choose seats but did not complete because we did not have access to a printer. Got the boarding passes from the machine at the airport but with the seats we had chosen online. Very smart departure area. Paid to go in the Malev business lounge (EUR 16 each) which was well worth it.,9,1
budapest-ferihegy-airport,K Sikora,United States,The No Entry or No Stop restriction at the arrival curbside of Ferihegy 1 and 2 airports is below any international standard of civilised travel. As a result arriving traffic has moved up to the 2A/2B Departure curbside making departure twice as congested as it should be. The overpriced parking lots are empty so are the overpriced taxis (parking without passengers) in the arrival area.,2,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,I Haaster,Canada,Booked with Malev AMS-BUD-IST with a transfer time of 45 minutes far too short. A very long line-up to exit the EU with few customs officials impossible! Several people missed their connecting flight. Very frustrating and inefficient system. Officials unable to help those who were missing their connecting flights. Beware while traveling through BUD on a short transfer!,1,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,Azlan Hashim,Malaysia,Arrived at this airport from Amsterdam. I was in the city within 90 minutes from the time of arrival. Staff at information counter not friendly and not happy with the job she is doing. The public transportation from or to the city was average but worked fine. I bought the 72 hours travel card (works on metro trams and buses) from the airport's post-office. The cheapest way to get to the city is by bus 200E from the arrival bay to the nearest metro station Station Kobanya-Kispest (M3) on the blue line. On the departure day at Terminal 2 Malev check-in agent and BUD's KLM staff were both polite and helpful. From check-in counter until clearing the security check point took less than 15 minutes although the airport had a busy period in the afternoon. Did not make any buying at the duty-free outlet due to tight waiting time for my departure. The airport seems clean. The only complaint is the airport has insufficient seating at departure area.,3,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,M Jonkman,Netherlands,Terminal 2 for transferring. Nice and clean airport. Because of change between Schengen and non-Schengen area a brisk walk from one wing of the terminal to another but not really a problem after just sitting in the airplane. Going out from Schengen there is no safety check coming inside there is. Restrooms a bit hard to find.,4,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,Y Ren,Australia,Very new and bright at departure area but the arrival area is really dark and dated. Bus door to door service is really good with reasonable price. Security staff are not friendly not pleasant experience. They are trying to improve the services but still long way to go.,3,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,Pawel Litwinski,Poland,I was pleasantly surprised : no queues at check in no queues at security. As regards arrivals nothing changed yet but everything worked properly. Overall a very pleasant experience.,5,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,Stephen Taynton,Kazakhstan,Arrival into terminal 2B is great - departure is another thing. Check in is a bit of a mess with the counters being opened two hours before hand and no real queue system in place. Security is very thorough - I was practically stripped searched - but no real problems - something you have to put up with these days. Biggest problem is signage - or lack of. Trying to get your tax back is fun and you need a lot of patience. Otherwise not a bad airport some good food places but on the steep side.,3,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,Eric Howell,United Kingdom,If you are flying with a no frills airline chances are you'll be using Terminal 1. This is a very cramped terminal and you really don't want to be spending much time here. Having said that the Duty Free shop is fine and for the smokers you'll be able to stock up on very low priced cigarettes. The terminal is very stuffy and far too warm but you will find two refreshment areas.,3,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,E Dorogi,United Kingdom,Taxis to/from airport very expensive public transport difficult. Travelling with pushchair in Budapest is a nightmare guess this is true for wheelchair users to. Baby changing facilities are rubbish : one table one mat and one chair. No picures or colours on the wall no toys. Cleanliness is ok. Restaurants are expensive. T1 (Low cow cost airlines) Spent 45 minutes queing at check in. Getting through the gate was not difficult as we got priority with the baby. T2 (other airlines) A town called Vecsas is close so anyone can do a late shopping (pharmacy shops). Arriving is much smoother and faster no hassle and queue at passport check.,3,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,M Guillemard,France,You need to arrive at least 2 hours in advance 3 if you like to be on the safe side. This airport is much too small (extension works on-going). There are only 5 booths open for all Malev Economy flights and the queue is terrible. They urge you to use the self-checking screens but you have to queue anyway to leave your luggage. Attendants do their best. When you are at least out of this queue you are in for a second one for the safety check which is aslo vastly undersized. Not much in term of shops or drinking/eating. The number of seats available at the gates is ridiculous. then you have the luck to board by Bus. I hope their future extension will be well designed because for the time being it is not an airport you want to use.,2,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,C Galindo,Spain,There were incredible queues at check-in and even longer ones at security check. We spent an hour and a half in the queue to pass the security checks without any kind of order. Moreover the staff at security check rude and hardly communicate in English. We really feel treated more like animals than as people.,1,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,Colin Haworth,United Kingdom,This airport is a nightmare both at check in and security. It took us 2 hours and this only because we sneaked under the barriers to avoid missing our flight which as it happened was delayed by over an hour anyway. Avoid if at all possible.,1,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,Kai Popkens,Belgium,This airport has been downgraded by EU authorities because of security issues. Had to wait long for Star Alliance check-in (I had my sport bike). Schengen terminal 2 only 1 x-ray machine attended with enormous queuing. BUD-FRA-BRU in FRA they made again a full security check even checked my shoes and said Budapest now is a 3rd world airport sorry for inconvenience. So stressful and quite abusing.,2,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,W Karpowicz,Poland,Arrival at Ferihegy is a bit deceiving. The direct train to the city is a joke the station lies in the vicinity of low-cost Terminal 1 while most of passengers arrive at Terminal 2 which is connected with T1 and the railway station by public road usually congested with urban traffic. At the remote railway stop there are no amenities for disabled passengers and no information at all. The real nightmare is the departure and transit. Taken into account incredible queues at check-in and then even longer queues at security check you should come to the airport well ahead the time the airlines suggest. Staff at security check is harsh and rude and hardly communicate in English. Due to the lack of space and insufficient number of gates in the Schengen terminal the crowds of passengers make it difficult to move not to say about places to seat. The only positive thing you see are the posters and leaflets saying how wonderful spacious and friendly the airport will be in future when the construction of new terminal is completed.,2,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,Gyorgy Szeibert,Hungary,Arrived at the airport terminal 2A and got a shock to see the unbelievable huge crowd at Star Alliance check-in. The end of the row was at the entrance of the airport. Seems LH and AUA don't really care of this situation weeks ago I was waiting 25 minutes for drop-off in the same time. I will think twice to use Swiss if check-in will be pooling into a big maze. Security improved a lot not waiting for long and they were friendly. Airside hard to find any free place to sit down on that Saturday afternoon restroom was clean. Many announcements were not clearly understandable thus I nearly miss my flight.,5,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,Ross Clark,United Kingdom,T2B. Prompt passport control (non-EU national) but baggage was slow. Travelling out : a 15min BA check-in queue but aggravated by 20 minutes to get through a crowded security area. The extension of T2 now underway is well overdue. In terms of landside access a ticket for the 200E bus can be purchased from the newsagents but to get a 3day or 7day pass you need to get to the underground station at Kobanya-Kispet. This is a nuisance as it should be possible to get these tickets at the airport. However can recommend the hotel shuttle service for timeliness and value-for-money.,3,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,Iain Williamson,Saudi Arabia,I have just had enough of the way check-in staff feel they can treat passengers at Ferihegy. I am not sure why repeatedly I get talked at as if I am an unwelcome alien. The only time I saw any personnel smile was when security found a jar of Slovak mustard and lobbed it into the bin happily. While I don`t object to this being termed a liquid if it must be I was rather surprised to say the least to hear the security guard a woman make a negative remark about me in Hungarian assuming I could not understand I think. I'll be flying into another airport when going back to Hungary.,2,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,B Kovacs,Hungary,Passed through BUD Terminal 2B 12 times in the last half year. Check-in usually takes a bit of time and can be extremely crowded so it is good to be there 90 minutes before your flight - except if you have already checked in online. Check-in staff not especially nice or helpful. There is only 4 check-in machine for Malev flights however this is their main hub and those machines are usually out of order or frozen for several minutes. Passing security takes time and they can also be rude. The airside is crowded with good facilities but only a few place to sit - let's hope that this will change with the current enlargement of the terminals. After boarding at peak times we often had to wait 5-10 minutes for the personnel of the airport to push back the plane from the standing position: there is not much capacity reserve for this at BUD. When arriving getting your luggage can take 5 minutes as well as 25 you should just cross your fingers and wait. I miss a central screen in the baggage reclaim area which would show which flight is delivered on which belt.,3,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,B Hewitt,United Kingdom,Terminal 2B. Arrival waited 20 minutes for baggage but apart from that quickly through immigration. Departure check in area very crowded but checked in took about 10 minutes through security in 5 minute. Departure lounge good with good food outlets.,4,0
buenos-aires-airport,Barry Aldridge,Afghanistan,"Aerolineas Argentinas' departure terminal is primitive and chaotic. Instead of everyone standing in one check-in line and being served by the next available agent, you stand in line by flight. The lines snake through the building and there is no one to tell you what you are supposed to do. The check-in area was dirty and overcrowded. Our gate was at a beautiful, new part of the airport with a few services. But, getting there from check-in is stressful and very unpleasant. The road to the airport was strewn with burned cars from rioting over power failures during the heat wave. I don't recommend this airport, but if you are flying international, it is your only option.",2,0
buenos-aires-airport,M Harper,United Kingdom,A nice airport: Convenient for city good flight arrival and departure displays. Relaxed atmosphere. Rapid and straightforward security. Security people pleasant and helpful. Decent range of places to buy food. Clean toilets Plenty of seats in gate area. Bus ride to and from plane (if needed) short. Bags arrive quickly. Taxis outside airport well organized.,9,1
buenos-aires-airport,E Williams,United States,Much improved infrastructure relative to my previous visit February 2011. Immigration (passport control) took 15 minutes despite huge lines (at least one other large international flight clearly landed just before ours from ATL). 32 passport control lines all staffed (why doesn't the US do this?). Another 5 minutes to send luggage through X-ray at customs. That's the time to nip over to Banco National to get Argentine currency at good exchange rate. Easy and convenient to get taxicab to center of city at kiosk in center of arrivals hall. Leaving spent 15 seconds in outgoing passport control. Both entry and exit passport control officers actually smiled!,9,1
buenos-aires-airport,Santiago Codiani,Mexico,I flew from EZE last Wednesday to Mexico with Turkish Airlines connecting in Sao Paulo. New Terminal is just bright and happy with nice bars and cool duty free shops. Star Alliance VIP is nice and offers a lot it looks like a furniture show room but it does the job. I made connection in GRU then Panama and finally Mexico and EZE is by far the nicest airport nor the biggest or the easiest. Overall really nice experience.,9,1
buenos-aires-airport,D West,United Kingdom,Arrived from LHR at 0830 after 13hr flight non stop with BA. Immigration queue was OK took about 20 mins which meant our luggage was waiting on the carousel. Then it all went haywire. Air France Iberia Lufthansa and Alitalia flights all arrived within an hour of ours so imagine about 1000 people plus suitcases trying to get through customs. 6 lines all formed in a very haphazard way which then moulded into 4 lines for 4 x-ray machines. This took us an hour to get through and into arrival hall. Another 90 mins standing there while our holiday reps organised coach transport. International Terminal A and the surrounding roads can't cope at peak times for all these arrivals. Our departure was much smoother I'm pleased to say. Luggage drop off fine security queue took about 10 mins passport control about the same. Stayed in the LAN lounge which is close to our departure gate (10). The departure lounge is modern I hope they do something about the Arrivals hall which leaves a lot to be desired.,6,0
buenos-aires-airport,E Dominguez,United States,It's been almost 2 years since the last time I used this airport and a lot has changed since. My flight - JFK via GIG arrived at gate 2 located in a very dated sector of terminal A. I know this part of the airport is scheduled to undergo improvements it really needs it but it looks like they've already started and some changes can be seen already like the new passport control area with many more passport desks located in the ground floor and brand new carrousels that replaced the very noisy old ones. Even so baggage claims still looks dated. I arrived at noon so passport control took less than 10 minutes. When I got to baggage claim my bags were already on the carrousel. Since every piece of luggage must be screened at customs there was a long line and it took me around 30 minutes to clear customs. The arrivals hall hasn't changed a bit - old and dark not the most welcoming. I got to the airport 4 hours prior to my flight because I was flying with a puppy. The check-in hall of terminal A is modern and very bright. Check-in was pretty quick and they let me check my bags and check the kennel with the puppy later. TAM Airlines personnel were kind and helpful as well as airport's employees. There was no line for security but there was a very long one for passport control - 30 minutes or more. I checked the screens and found out that my flight was already boarding at gate 10. Sadly I had to rush through Ezeiza's lovely free-shop in order to get to the gate on time. Gate 10 is located in a new building that replaces the old terminal B with very nice boarding areas great views of one of the runways and new concessions like Starbucks and Quilmes (Argentina's most famous beer). I didn't have time to wander through this new area that houses gates 8 to 23 but it looks spacious and pretty nice.,7,1
buenos-aires-airport,Rupert Downing,Canada,Took just under an hour in the PM rush hour from downtown to EZE but the taxi arrived about 15 mins late due to tie up in microcentro. United told us to give 3 hours but they opened their desks 30 minutes late resulting in line ups. Excellent Global Alliance Gold check in economy looked efficient as well. It took just 30 minutes to get through security and immigration. More efficient than US. Airside very limited United lounge OK.,5,0
buenos-aires-airport,J Angeli,Argentina,Airport personnel very bad long lines for emigration and customer. The terminal facilities are not good there are too many free shops in areas where should be only for passengers after you arrive and pass emigration you have to go through a free shop in order to get the baggage claim sector.,1,0
buenos-aires-airport,Tomek Surdel,Argentina,The main problem of EZE airport are queues. Several times I had to wait more than half an hour to pass immigration control (both on departure and arrival). Waiting times for check-in security control and customs control on arrival are only slightly better. Other issues are totally overpriced duty-free shops. Prices are crazy.,3,0
buenos-aires-airport,A O'Brien,Ireland,Used EZE on a resent trip to BAires and was pleasantly surprised. Travelling on Air France and although the plane parks at Terminal C you actually arrive into Terminal B. The line for immigration can be long but just make sure you are in the right one. When I was there the line for Argentines was much longer than the non- Argentine one. Staff at immigration and customs were professional. Once through to land-side things can be a little hectic. On Departure Air France use Terminal C which is brand new. Immigration was fast and friendly. Terminal C has two places to eat a large Duty Free area and a few smaller stores. It does not however have a currency exchange facility so I would recommend changing most of your Pesos before leaving for the airport.,9,1
buenos-aires-airport,M Boynton,United States,This is a very nice clean and functional airport. It is not anything elaborate but it gets the job done and is miles ahead of other South American airports. The lines for check-in with TAM were quick and the security checkpoints and passport control were fast and efficient. The gates in Terminal A are spacious with plenty of seating and the terminal has good signage in both Spanish and English. A very pleasant experience overall.,8,1
buenos-aires-airport,Alasdair Brooks,United Kingdom,I had no problems arriving in or leaving Ezeiza; a functional airport. Immigration and customs on arrival at the modern Terminal A was fast and efficient - and likewise there was nothing particularly out of the ordinary about queues at security and immigration on the way out. I arrived at 10am 2.5 hours before my flight and was through check-in security and immigration in about an hour. Queues at the boarding gate showed a Latin disregard for Northern European concepts of orderly queuing. Airside eating options aren't fantastic but are functional; duty free shopping is fairly extensive.,7,1
buenos-aires-airport,C Ortega,Mexico,I arrived almost five hours prior my flight thinking I would have time to shop and eat dinner. It took me up to 2.5 hours to check in to AA. The airport was crowded. There was a strike on the way to the airport and many people came late. After that almost 1.5 hours to pass security line. There are some nice stores in the duty free. The airport is small considering the volume of passengers and old but well maintained.,5,0
buenos-aires-airport,David Guenthner,United States,Arrived almost 3 hrs before my flight. I was flying First Class so it only took 20 mins to check my bags I probably would have missed my flight if I'd been in general check-in. The line for security stretched halfway through the terminal. It was a little more than 30 mins to the ID check. Once through that there was another long queue to get through security - of the 5 lanes only 3 were open and took 45 mins to clear. Customers took another 30 mins to clear. That left just enough time for a quick stop in the American lounge before our flight was announced.,3,0
buenos-aires-airport,Simon Smith,United Kingdom,I found it a very good experience and better than many airports in the UK. There are two terminals. A is new clean and used by international airlines. B is old and (I believe) only used by some Aerolineas Argentinas flights. Arriving in terminal A I was outside having collected my bags in 30 minutes. Checking in opened 4 hours before the flight and I was through quickly. Departing it was all very organised and what appeared long queues at passport control and security went very quickly 5 minutes maximum. Some tips (partly covered already). On arrival best rates for exchange are at Banco Nacional. There is a desk in the luggage hall if this is closed then exit the arrivals channel completely and take two turns to the right. Much better rates than elsewhere. Taxis ignore all the spivs hanging around and go to Taxi Ezezia desk in the middle of the floor when you exit arrivals. 150 pesos to city centre including tolls. On departures there is very little once airside however there are several cafes landside including a McDonalds with an outside terrace. This is a good place to sit and watch events outside the terminal incessant hooting whistling etc which of course everyone ignores. I watched an amusing episode where two people cut each other up got out and hugged/chatted then cut each other up again trying to exit the drop off zone. Airside I found perfume to be cheap but everything else relatively expensive by local standards.,4,0
buenos-aires-airport,S Sadak,Portugal,This airport is a nightmare. Immigration control can take up to 1h 30min like it happened to me. It just needs 2 planes arriving at the same time. Customs procedure the same. Leaving the country is no different but worse. Make sure you arrive in time for check-in and passport control especially in the evening when many intercontinental flights depart. I recommend at least 2h before departure. Duty-free area is good for South American airports and good prices.,2,0
buenos-aires-airport,Roger Stone,Australia,Unlike other reviews I found EZE a fairly unpleasant experience. The boarding gate areas were almost always crammed and stressful places. The terminal seems to have very few good shops and poor information on arriving flights. In fact no information was available for arriving flights on any monitors I could find. I was looking to see how delayed my colleague's flight was on an arrivals monitor but cound not find one anywhere including the American Airlines- One World Admirals Club lounge (although the staff there were very helpful). Another reason for referring to arrivals monitors is to assess how honest the departures monitors are - eg: if the arriving aircraft from a certain airline is running many hours late it would be unlikely if its associated departing flight was on time. I found the general staff overly officious the business lounges incredibly small and crowded (don't use the Iberia One World Lounge - it reminded me of a very small regional airport lounge in Australia) and the restaurant and food outlets extremely limited. In winter poor foggy weather can cause major flight delays so be prepared!,3,0
buenos-aires-airport,B Diener,Canada,I arrived and departed from EZE. To fully enjoy this airport you really have to like waiting in line. Upon arrival you have to wait in line at immigration which is normal at most international airports. However when you depart you have to wait in line at the check-in as the check-in kiosks aren't common at EZE yet. In addition you have to wait in line for passport control and of course security. The security check is fairly thorough but they only have a few stations which causes huge line ups. I really appreciated the smoking room in the departure level as well as the pretty large duty free shop. When you depart from EZE in the evening you need to leave for the airport on time. The trip from downtown Buenos Aires can easily take 1.5 to 2 hours during rush hour. The public transport to/from the airport is adequate.,4,0
buenos-aires-airport,D Gollan,United States,I wish more airports offered the excellent Customer Service that Aeropuertos Argentinas does at Ezeiza with fully manned desks and helpful staff. During my trip this month I ran into delayed flights cancelations and even a strike by Aerolineas Argentinas staff. Speaking little Spanish I couldn't have managed without this superb organization. I have used them on arrival to have porters available as my wife and I can no longer handle heavy luggage.,5,0
buenos-aires-airport,Kenneth Mackie,United Kingdom,EZE has been upgraded over the years and arrival experience is much better than before. Luckily arrived this time at 1130 with TAM and into an almost empty immigration hall. It can be chock a block when several flights from Europe / USA arrive at once but my worst wait was no more then 30 minutes. Baggage claim straightforward. A word to the uninitiated - do not consider changing money in the arrivals hall or area immediately outside other than at the Banco de la Nacion. BNA offered usd $1 for ARS $390 the going rate. I saw the other places offering $330. Taxi Ezeiza (safereliable and prepaid at the kiosk ) is ARS $118 into town but only ARS $88 for the return. Do not consider a verbal offer from anyone in the arrivals area. Departing processes are straightforward again depending upon time of day and the Duty Free shopping is quite good. Toilet facilities airside could do with modernisation but are clean.,4,0
buenos-aires-airport,Penny Ashworth,Australia,Arrived 3 hours prior to international flight and no queues at check-in but then it was a 2 am flight. Little security at xray but we found out why later. As we arrived at 10pm the few shops were shutting. Old sparse seating which was shiny with dirt. nothing to do except eat in a small expensive restaurant which was totally out of place. Went to board flight and got our bags emptied by stupid desk clerks who thought they knew what they were doing (explains lack of previous security desk clerks cheaper than security who might actually know what they are doing). Made us drink all water before getting on plane despite policy of allowing beverages on a plane that have been purchased after security (didnt make people drink alcohol!). Took my anti-bacterial handgel off me as said it was flammable pointed out global pandemic (and flying Aerolineas Argentinas it is essential!) she stated there was no pandemic any more! Couldn't be bothered arguing the point of alcoholic drinks and flammability. Other terminal is slightly better but only arrived there and out again. Baggage area is small but getting a taxi to hotel easy but dont go with luxury cars in immediate arrivals go to taxi desk in arrivals hall cheaper and very efficient set price too so no nasty surprises.,2,0
buenos-aires-airport,G Liwszyc,Finland,Late evening check in for my FRA bound flight took 3 minutes. This is a remarkable fact since this is prime time at EZE airport with many long haul flights departing for SE Asia the Americas and Europe. No need any more to go to another window to pay the mandatory airport tax which saves some minutes/hassle. This is included in your fare if ticket has been purchased after March 2009. No queues/delays at security. Even when at least 100 people where waiting in line for passport control it took no more than 10 minutes in an ever moving queue since all 20 booths were manned and moving fast. Take that Miami airport! Inside the terminal relaxed feeling due to its spaciousness public areas etc.,5,0
buenos-aires-airport,N Soderman,,I have flown in and out of EZE a handful of times in the last couple of years as I have family in Argentina and cannot remember any problems. Ok there were horrible queues once as I was departing and not a lot of places for sitting down the cafes are getting expensive but other than that I'd say it's good. I have flown Iberia and TAM so not sure if that's part of the equation. I would agree that Tierra Leon is good for transport to and from the airport but if there's two or more adults you get a taxi for the same price. (Tierra Leon don't charge for two year olds and indeed free transfer from where they stop in the city to Retiro from where you can catch a long distance bus- and these are good! Can get one leaving a few hrs or sooner after you get there for a decent price!) In fact long distance coach travel all over South America is good in my experience but that belongs under a different topic obviously.,4,0
buenos-aires-airport,Barbara Connors,,"I was dreading returning to the States via the Buenos Aires Airport after reading the reviews. While the airport is inefficient and the processes disorganized the actual experience was not as horrible as I thought it would be. I think I got there just before the big crush of people for the evening flights back to the States which undoubtedly helped. My advice: It's a waste of time to check in on-line for a Delta flight. The Delta staff insist on printing boarding passes and just won't accept the on-line version. Contrary to what you may hear there are no automated check-in machines at the airport. I was told there were 2 for Delta - there are actually none. Security is convoluted and not reassuring. You go through luggage ""security"" prior to getting in line to get your boarding pass at the main passenger desk. I saw no value in the process but they dig out the paper print out they have for your reservation and hand it to you to take with your luggage to the desk. Fortunately the check-in line was short but had lengthened by the time I finished. You get your boarding passes at the main desk and they check in your checked baggage. No problem with this part of the process and my luggage arrived just fine at JFK. You next pay your $18 tax to exit Argentina. The tax booth is now in the middle of the international airlines main passenger service area so very convenient. Less than 5 minutes but again the line had grown and I think I just lucked out. There was a tax window upstairs as well but it didn't look staffed. You next fill out your immigration form and take it your receipt for your tax payment and your carry-on baggage to go through Security. One station operating and over a 100 people in line. But don't worry it's not very thorough so the line moves quickly - less than 30 minutes. Fast but not a feeling of confidence. You find your departure gate after walking through an expansive duty- free area - don't bother buying water at this point as they won't let you take it through the next security check. You clear a mini-security as the final step prior to boarding. Very quick - line again moves quite fast. If you need to leave gate area to use bathroom you have to re-clear this security check. But it's fast. Refund of VAT - I didn't go through this process as I didn't buy much so I can't comment. Overall I found the people friendly and helpful - the entire process took about 1 hour 15 minutes but I believe that if you arrive at 7 or 8pm the process could take the 3 hours you read about.",3,0
buenos-aires-airport,Paul Harvey,,Flew in and out December - January to and from Europe. I was prepared for a hard time in an airport which has not attracted good (or even adequate) reviews but it was not too bad. Upon arrival (mid morning) my only comment would be that Immigration was heavily overloaded although they did their best to process us as fast as possible. Luggage delivery time was quite reasonable. We arrived early for departure having read all of the comments about delays - it took us about 45 mins to check in pay our tax and get through security and immigration. I think this time could be very much longer at peak times since the queue snaked a long way at a reasonably quiet time of the day.,3,0
buenos-aires-airport,C Jordan,,I have flown into and out of Ezeiza several times in the last 2 years. I just arrived in BA yesterday and the immigration baggage claim and customs area seem to have been re-done and are a lot more efficient. I enjoy the fact that you can duty-free shop entering Argentina! Departure is less organized but I check in using the business class queue (American Airlines) which usually takes only 10-15 minutes at the worst (the economy queue is always very long). Taxi Ezeiza is always a safe bet for transport into the city a kiosk right in the center of the floor when you exit customs. They are fast and efficient at a published rate that is always cheaper than the remises (and they offer a cheaper rate from the city to EZE - call to make an appointment when you leave).,3,0
buenos-aires-airport,Mark Street,,I've traveled through EZE a couple of times in the last month. Arrival is no problem and I had no problems getting a reasonably cheap taxi to the centre from the kiosk outside the terminal. Where EZE is lacking is at check in. I've checked in on different occasions for flights to the US with Delta and to Europe with Lufthansa. In both cases I arrived with a good 3 hours to spare and had to queue for at least 1.5 hours to check in for Economy. In both cases the queue snaked outside the roped off area and down the terminal! They really need more staff and more open check in desks for Economy. With less than 1 hour to boarding there was till a massive queue for a 747 flight - which ended up leaving late. Don't forget you have still to queue to pay airport tax security screening and passport check So arrive early folks!,2,0
buenos-aires-airport,S Koenig,,Most comments are concerning EZE the international airport outside of town. The domestic airport near the city center is smaller and simpler but relatively modern with plenty of dining options. Do beware of theft: my digital camera was stolen from next to me when my back was turned. There was no place to report this within the security area (woman at the info desk suggested I look for someone outside of security and when I later at another airport asked an Aerolineas Argentinas rep about asking whether a camera had been turned in she essentially said kiss it goodbye). Back at EZE one point is that the most obvious money exchange places as you exit give the lowest rates. The national bank branch giving the best rates is outside of security and a couple of turns to the right. Not at all obvious. Ditto on taxis: those easiest to find are very pricey. For cheaper ones you need to hunt a bit outside.,3,0
buenos-aires-airport,Barry McKay,,"Buenos Aires airport can be somewhat frustrating but compared to transiting through Washington Dulles en route to Canada it is a breeze. Upon arrival it takes some time in the queue to clear Immigration. You will be given a copy of your Immigration declaration put this away somewhere safe as you may be asked for it on departure. However the real problem  unless you can carry your baggage manually is the shortage of luggage carts. They are provided free of charge but there just aren't enough of them. I had to wait 30 minutes before airport staff finally arrived with some but friends who arrived later never did get one and had to man-handle their luggage to Customs. If you do have to wait for a cart you can use the opportunity to exchange US dollars at the bank that is adjacent to the Customs exit area - it's the one that airline staff use and they give a fair exchange rate. Clearance through Customs posed no problems once I got a cart but if you are taking a taxi downtown be extremely cautious. Do not under any circumstances accept the offer of taxi touts outside the airport offering to get you a cab - you can get badly burnt. Use only those yellow cabs parked at the official rank which you will see on exiting the airport. When leaving the best bet is to book a ""remise"" - a car that will pick you up and charge a pre agreed amount. In my case it cost 70 pesos from downtown to the airport. Airport departure procedures are more complex and frustrating than arrival. First you need to queue to obtain a boarding pass and the time this takes seems to vary from day to day. I went through in about 15 minutes but my friends took far longer than that. Next if you are going to claim a tax refund on purchases you will need to queue at the Customs booth - same ground floor level as the airline desks - to get your tax forms (the ones provided by the stores where you made your purchases) stamped. Next go upstairs to the tax refund office and queue once more to obtain your refund. This should not take more than 10 minutes. You will have the option of immediate payment in Argentine pesos or dollars which can be credited to a credit card. I took the cash as I will be returning to BA again. Next you have to queue once more to pay your airport departure tax - adjacent to the tax refund office. This can be paid in US dollars ($18.00) the equivalent in pesos or by credit card. When this is done you will go through initial screening next to the airport tax counter. Once inside you will next have to queue to pass Immigration. There is a form that has to be filled out - available at airline check-in desk - and you may possibly also be asked for the Immigration form you were give when arriving. Once this is done you are basically done until boarding time whan your hand luggage will be manually examined prior to boarding. To be sure of getting through all these procedures on time one should allow 2 1/2 hours to be on the safe side. And best eat before leaving for the airport as there is nothing much available at the airport in the way of food.",3,0
buenos-aires-airport,Byron Scott,,I connected from SCL to ORD via EZE. I concur with the comment that prices are obscenely expensive. I bottle of soda was 7.50 Arg. pesos. There is really only one place to eat after security in the international (non-AR) terminal. There's a fair amount of shopping but food and beverage options are very limited.,3,0
buenos-aires-airport,M Marchesoni,,EZE airport is clean modern european style. Only downside is that the it is extremely expensive the prices are too much It seem that the airport operator has a monopoly and they control all the shops. I loved the airport the people and the city but that the prices are too much.,4,0
buenos-aires-airport,Barry O'Hagan,,My wife and I took the Manuel Tienda Deleon coach from the airport to Buenas Aires last Wednesday. Some 20 minutes after we were dropped at our hotel I received a phone call to my room from the Manager of the coach company. It seems the driver had noticed that I had inadvertently given him $100 along with the $10 tip I had intended. He immediately returned to the hotel with the $100. Let's say I was a very happy camper and very impressed with the driver's honesty. A great first impression of Buenas Aires.,4,0
buenos-aires-airport,G Hillier,,I visit Buenos Aires 2 or more times per year and while the city remains great Ezieza Airport is becoming more of a mess each time I visit. In all fairness arrivals are usually OK - in January I deplaned went thru Immigration claimed my bags and was on my way within 30 minutes. Try that in Chicago or JFK ! Now for the bad news: departures are a disaster - I would recommend arriving 3 hours early even if flying First/Business Class. I took nearly an hour to get checked in for a Business Class passenger then you pay the airport tax and head upstairs to security (a breeze) and Argentine Exit Stations (slow) . Boarding Areas are filthy and feature broken down chairs! A final cursory search of your hand luggage occurs at boarding - then you have an 8-11 flight back to the USA. What a mess.,2,0
buffalo-airport,R Liria,Canada,I was trying to find a parking spot for more than 70 minutes in the only small enclosed parking and finally I left to park outside. Can't believe an airport with that traffic and weather don't have a covered parking area for people who would like to pay for it. Really bad service.,3,0
buffalo-airport,S Selvaraj,Canada,Excellent option travelling from Toronto Canada. Quick drive to apt check-in is a breeze as only single flight scheduled at desk smaller aircraft means smaller line-ups everywhere. Security was thorough but very quick - no rush no herding. Apt is spacious enough to handle the crowd. No walking endlessly. Collect baggage and walk out to the outside in a minute. The ride to the apt from Toronto is not at all bad allow 2.5 hrs travel time door to door from the middle of Toronto. Will always be my only choice for North American travel. Food options not much air-side.,9,1
buffalo-airport,James Burke,,K George is right on the money. As we were getting our things out of our car for our flight the Parking Shuttle guy patiently waited for us and helped more than most do. We flew out on Southwest and in on US Airways. Buffalo works well for SW as there is very little time wasted for taxiing so planes can get in and get out quickly. The airport is bright and easy to use. Be advised that the Jetway does not get lowered for regional jets so if its a rainy day and you are on a CRJ or ERJ to BUF have a newspaper handy to hold over your head!,5,0
buffalo-airport,K George,,BUF is a great smallish airport to fly into and out of. Security moves quickly the lines are short and it's very convenient for pick-up/drop-off and rentals. Upon arrival you can literally be in your car with baggage within 20 mins. Parking is expansive and cheap and there are always friendly drivers ready to pick you up at your car or drive you to it after arrival. The airport itself is bright and inviting- very well designed. It is also large enough to have a pretty good selection of flights- there are about 30 or so gates and probably a dozen or so airlines. You can't always get a direct flight but the options are not bad at all. My only gripe is there are only a few restaurant choices but since BUF is rarely a changeover it's not somewhere you'll usually spend a lot of time anyway.,5,0
buffalo-airport,Gary Marsh,,Buf appears to be a nice little airport with friendly staff who are very efficient and treat customers with respect. The downside being airside shops and restaurants facilities are rather poor compared to other airports. The airport waiting areas are not too bad and gates quite near to each other. Quite a pleasant airport to fly into and out of.,3,0
buffalo-airport,Nathan Gilbert,,I live in the Niagara Region on the Ontario Canada side and grew up in the Buffalo area. At one time it was common for Americans to trek to Toronto in order to obtain the best selection of flights at reasonable prices. Buffalo used to have three ancient small terminal buildings very limited parking and a small cartel of airlines operating out of it. Since the new airport in Buffalo has been built the range of airline choice and scheduling has grown and prices have fallen. Toronto on the other hand with its growth and congestion has become increasingly more expensive and although the drive from here is barely more than an hour that's hypothetical because traffic is always so bad in TO then if that's not enough parking is a nightmare you have to walk great distances to get to and inside of the terminals and now regardless of where you want to fly to it's much more expensive even after taking exchanges into consideration. We can leave our home be at Buffalo- Niagara in less than 45 minutes parking is plentiful and cheap but because it's such a hassle-free trip it's never any problem to get someone to do a drop off. You can just get in and out of there fast. I do agree the security barriers were placed in the most awkward part of the airport severely limiting the access to more shops and restaurant choices. The baggage carrousel area is also a bit tight when a few flights arrive at once but again these are small problems compared to the ease and reasonable prices. And for domestic flights within the US when you live in Canada you can entirely avoid customs when arriving and just drive from the airport and do your declarations at whatever bridge and it's so much easier. It's nice to be in this area and have the choice of airports - to include Hamilton which is making travel within Canada easier for us in this region.,4,0
buffalo-airport,Martin Keenan,,Like some of the other reviewers here I'm a Canadian that uses BUF as an alternative to Toronto Pearson International. The reason is simple - - for flights within the United States it's vastly cheaper to fly from Buffalo -- On one occasion recently I was able to make a flight out of Buffalo for literally half what it would have cost from Toronto (all taxes included). Two significant reasons why Buffalo is cheaper -- Firstly Pearson charges possibly the highest landing fees in the world and second the United States TSA charges higher security fees for trans-border versus U.S. domestic flights. One review of Buffalo Airport complained about it being hard to fly anywhere direct from Buffalo but I suspect that most airports are like that these days. With one connection you can get to most places from Buffalo. My one issue with the airport is that it was designed in the pre-9/11 era and nearly all the airport facilities (stores restaurants etc.) are in the secure area so there isn't much to do for people waiting for arriving flights.,,0
buffalo-airport,David Howe,,Southwest and Jet Blue offer a cheap alternative to us Canadians but airport fees at YYZ adding 80% to a fare is somewhat of an exaggeration. This airport is not a travel friendly place one of the coldest and most impersonal airports I have ever been in. The parking system is quite expensive and very disorganized the shuttle buses wander aimlessly and don't pick up on a first come first served basis. The day we left there were noisy sirens and alarms going off all the time and all the staff just ignored them and my eardrums just hummed and I couldn't hear anything that was going on. While the food sold was good there was very little selection (apart from Burger King before security every outlet had the same menu) and the prices were exorbitant.,,0
buffalo-airport,Kevin Leung,,BUF is an excellent airport as a second choice for Toronto people flying to Chicago Northeastern USA and Florida especially you are travelling with a whole family. Southwest fare from BUF to Florida is so low CAD150 include tax round trip for family of four flying from BUF to Florida can save you a lots of money! BUF itself is small user- friendly and just 1.5 hours from Toronto. I did that before - park my car check in security boarding all in 35 mins!,,0
buffalo-airport,Michael Sandler,,Have been using this airport as an alternative to Pearson Intl (YYZ- Toronto) because of Pearson’s outrageous airport fees. I have routinely bought an airline ticket thinking that it was a great price only to find out that the airport fees add another 80% to the ticket. Buffalo Intl is an ok airport its quite small but it gets the job done. One problem with this airport is the paltry number of flights that leave the airport. Unless you live in the Northeast it is almost impossible to fly without connecting somewhere. The only other gripe that I have is that the food selection at the airport is rather poor.,,0
bujumbura-airport,A Sharma,United Kingdom,The most basic airport I have been to. Having been brought up in Burundi and been travelling there and back to the UK over several years I think this airport has gone downhill. Many years ago this was an exciting airport. People could see you off from the observation balcony but gone are the days! My dad wasn't even allowed into the airport to see me off. Airport staff will make your life hell just to say your last good byes to family. My Kenya Airways flight to Nairobi was slightly delayed coming into the airport due to a power cut! I have never experienced anything like it! My arrival into the airport was just as bad with airport staff wanting to open all bags and wanting bribes in order to keep things. Thank god my family had airport entry passes which meant we weren't left short changed. In all honesty I would still recommend as it's just a crazy yet brilliant experience!,5,0
bujumbura-airport,D Stanley,United Kingdom,This is a very basic and small airport. Facilities are limited. Most parts of the airport are covered but are not air conditioned relying on natural ventilation. Mosquitoes could be a problem at some times. Fortunately there are not too many staff hassling for your money. baggage reclaim was reasonably efficient. No real problems departing. Again there are very limited facilities. There are a couple of shops selling the usual tourist fare and expensive bottles of alcohol. The bar/café is not bad but is overpriced - $5 for a simple snack. The business lounge is nothing more than a room with a TV.,2,0
burbank-glendale-pasadena-airport,S Koenig,Brazil,Note that this airport has not been officially called Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena airport for several years. It was renamed the Bob Hope Airport in 2003 (though most people just call it the Burbank Airport and the airport code is BUR). It is a small domestic airport with fewer airlines than in the past since American Airlines departed last year. Departing on our recent trip was a breeze: we stopped off our rental car at the Avis facility (Avis Hertz and one or two others are on the terminal site; other such as Budget and Enterprise require a shuttle bus) I quickly walked to the terminal and got a luggage cart and we returned to the terminal and checked in. I think we were the only ones in the TSA security line. Breezed through. There is one restaurant outside security and a smaller eatery and bar inside. A couple of small shops inside the terminal. One walks up a sort of sideways V shaped ramp to get to one's plane (I think they may offer use of umbrellas if it rains).,9,1
burbank-glendale-pasadena-airport,E Mabley,United States,Burbank provides a convenient and easy alternative to LAX although the departure hall in Terminal B is too small to accommodate more than 2 flights at a time. There were 4 flights (an MD-80 a 737 and 2 CRJ regional jets) boarding simultaneously and the small space and cramped conditions caused confusion and delayed boarding for everyone.,6,0
burbank-glendale-pasadena-airport,S Koenig,Brazil,Bob Hope Airport as it is formally known is small and easy to navigate. Check-in counters have limited service with strong encouragement to use automated kiosks. No collection of hotels nearby as in the case of LAX but there are a few with shuttle service. As noted sparse food and shopping options. Not the best place to kill time if your flight is delayed. With some rental car companies you can quickly walk between the terminal and your car while with others you need to take a shuttle bus. You can also take one of the parking shuttles to the nearby Metrolink/Amtrak rail station.,4,0
burbank-glendale-pasadena-airport,E Mabley,United States,Burbank is a very small regional airport serving the San Fernando Valley and northern Los Angeles suburbs with only 12 gates and no jetways but it's a very good alternative to the chaos that is LAX. There are flights on Southwest (dominant carrier) United US Airways JetBlue American and Alaska to all major western USA airports plus Dallas/Ft. Worth and New York JFK. The terminal is very small and can get overcrowded during peak times and food/beverage/concession options are very Spartan but it's easy to navigate has excellent free wi-fi and the security screening process is streamlined and well-run. You can also walk from the terminal to the long-term parking lot which you can't do at LAX.,4,0
burbank-glendale-pasadena-airport,E Mabley,,BUR provides a pleasant alternative to LAX. The terminal complex is a bit small so during peak times it can get crowded but security and check-in lines move quickly. There are no jetways but being in California weather is seldom an issue and it's quite nice walking onto the tarmac to board your plane by stairs. If you're in a wheelchair they will use a mechanical lift to raise you to the aircraft door. The food and shopping offerings are bare bones and quite disappointing. If using the Metrolink rail is convenient to your travel BUR is an excellent alternative because there is a station across the street from the terminal but the airport is a bit difficult to get to by road because there is no freeway access within 2 miles. Traffic at rush hour can be difficult.,4,0
burbank-glendale-pasadena-airport,Joaquin Quinto,,Small airport dating back to the early days of aviation when the thinking was that would be aerodromes in most towns.

burbank-glendale-pasadena-airport,J Segal,,Enjoy flying in and out of BUR-very easy compact airport it is my preferred LA area airport. There about 10 times a year. If you rent from the correct car rental no need for buses you can walk right out to your car. The only bad aspect is time. Car rentals do not open for returns (if you want a receipt) until 6am and security does not open any earlier. Flew out yesterday and by the time I returned the car and got through security they were already boarding my flight-walked directly onto the plane. Not such a terrible thing I guess.,4,0
burbank-glendale-pasadena-airport,R Lapine,,This airport is incongruous. On the one hand the food service stand such that it is is a cave. I am kind of worried that Sloth is hiding in the shadows. The music - effeminate EuroPop from the late 1980s - think Frankie Goes to Hollywood - just does not match the interior that may never have been renovated. Then you've got the external baggage claim. And Southwest. And JetBlue And a large mountain dominating the horizon. Once the DEA interrogated me on a tip during my business trip. And the exterior looks ripped out of 1973. It's all very bizarre.,3,0

burbank-glendale-pasadena-airport,Peter Dowling,,Just flew through BUR a couple of times. What a quaint little airport straight out of the 1930's. I'm sure it was fine for DC-3's but it struggles immensely with 737's. Christopher Schmidt mentions that terminal A is narrow. Well I flew out of terminal B and I thought that it was exceptionally narrow. Burbank is well located and fares are good but if you go there patience and a happy disposition will be great virtues. Also don't expect to get somewhere to sit while you're waiting.,,0
burbank-glendale-pasadena-airport,Christopher Schmidt,,Eat before you go to the airport. The food outlets offer items that were packaged during the Reagan administration! Terminal A (Southwest/America West) is extremely narrow! Terminal B (American/Alaska/Delta/United) is quite efficient; early morning flights (before 0800) however will face LONG and slow moving security lines - often reaching the Terminal A check-in lobby. Note that while American and Alaska use Terminal B gates and baggage claim their check-in counters are in A.,,0
burbank-glendale-pasadena-airport,Paul Townsend,,My trip through the Burbank Airport was a mixed experience. The passenger terminal has a run-down appearance to it that is in need of updating. Carpeting and wall paneling do not seem to have been upgraded in a while. The terminal lacks jet bridges and the baggage claim conveyor is out of doors which I actually find quite pleasant when the weather is nice but awful during rainstorms. The food and shopping options were minimal though I did not get a chance to check their prices. On the positive side however: the airport is very conveniently located for much of Los Angeles and has convenient access to the freeways. Despite the dilapidated look of the terminal it is a lot less confusing and intimidating than LAX - finding my way through the place was easy. The view of the mountains and desert outside of my airplane window on approach to the airport was enjoyable. The Southwest Airlines personnel did their jobs with the usual commendable levels of courtesy and professionalism and at no time did I find the lines to be too long.,,0
burlington-airport,J Butler,United States,It is the only airport regionally that people have to use.

Considering all the work that has taken place recently I was surprised the transfer situation is so inelegant.,5,1
cairns-airport,Susan Morgan,United Kingdom,We were flying CNS to HKG with Cathay Pacific and again very disappointed with Cairns Business Class Lounge. The food comprised of poor presentation along with an uninspiring menu. The only hot food displayed was soup and apart from various 'nibbles' the only other option was a dry baguette that had been sliced in inches and some salmon - completely unappetizing. As for drinks the chilled cabinet consisted of only four bottles of wine none of which were champagne as you would expect when you're paying Business Class prices. I had to find someone from the kitchen to ask if champagne was available and the young lady in charge told that no it wasn't available and that only a sparkling wine was an option. The bottle in the cabinet turned out to be flat and a fresh bottle was opened by said staff. Staff attitude was very poor. This wasn't our first time at Cairns Int. but the worst so far. And while we were in the Lounge a lady ground staff member in full high viz jacket came in and helped herself to some soup - unusual to say the least.,,0
cairns-airport,Soeren Krumrey,Australia,"Have just arrived here for the first time in three years. The so called ""renovation"" has finally been finished but is a total let down. Walkways to the gates are at least covered now and airconed but still concrete walkways with metal shed like walls around it worse than in 3rd world countries. Departure area has the same shops and fast food outlets as before. Major rip off is charging for luggage trolleys even in London Heathrow and LA they are free! Felt ashamed when I explained to dozens of tourists from the US and Japan that they need to pay (cash coins - not even credit cards accepted!) for these. Great welcome into the country and absolutely not excusable!",3,0
cairns-airport,Rod Harmer,Australia,I have travelled extensively around the world and would have to say that Cairns Domestic Airport is nothing short of disgraceful. Check in is OK but from there on it's an absolute shambles. Several flights have passengers in the one queue and you don't have any idea if you are in the correct one. The Airlines P/A is inaudible and there is very little seating in the common boarding area. Once you have worked out that you are in the correct very long queue it's a long wait to get through to the boarding check in and then it's almost a marathon walk to the aircraft. It must be at least 800+ metres and after walking up and down concrete ramps you then end up on an airbridge. There is no doubt that this appalling airport will put me off visiting Cairns again.,1,0
cairns-airport,Brian Lamprell,Australia,What a “dog’s breakfast” of a place is Cairns Domestic Airport. Arriving passengers parade through the departure terminal and eventually find their way into the baggage collection area. Dropping off passengers is also a trial. A very confusing series of direction signs can easily have motorists heading down dead ends or wrong roadways. It's the same for car rental returns. In the airport to get from the car rental desk to the check-in area requires a 100 metre walk in the scorching sun or pouring rain.,1,0
cairns-airport,J Ansar,New Zealand,"Arrived at International terminal no facilities open at all - advised to go to domestic terminal put bags in locker and go through security to get some food ""International"". Airport is nice big and empty but that is about it.",2,0
cairns-airport,Peter McDowall,New Zealand,Under staffed and lacking facilities such as airline lounges. Excessive queueing untidy restaurants and cramped waiting areas. A complete contradiction to the rest our Cairns experience.,1,0
cairns-airport,Ralph Lewis,Australia,I've transited Cairns airport domestically a number of times in the last 12 months. The building work does not appear to be progressing satisfactorily - the baggage collection area remains a disgrace and for those unlucky enough to be arriving at gate 18 or gate 1 there is a long very-poorly signposted walk landside having to clear security again. Colleagues tell me that the security queues aren't always that bad but I'm yet to experience short lines there.,2,0
cairns-airport,W Smithers,Australia,Cairns Domestic is a shambles whilst the reconstruction of the terminal drags on forever. Make sure you have comfortable walking shoes on arrival as the trek from the domestic arrivals Gates 20-22 are via a poorly signposted circuitous route taking you to the other side of the terminal then you are directed outside in the elements dodging contractors and their equipment to a soulless baggage collection hall miles from anywhere. Totally inadequate seating for departures with passengers queuing up like sheep (despite everyone having an allocated seat) and blocking incoming passengers at the gate. PA announcements are inaudible and airport staff schlep around in a tropical topor.,1,0
cairns-airport,K Pardoe,Australia,Domestic terminal undergoing major renovations/additions. Long walk from gate through building site and then quite a way outside to taxi upon arrival. All ok if you are up to it but could be difficult for less mobile or with lots of baggage/children. Also ok if not pouring with rain. On departure taxi drops off and you have to cross a road without cover to get into terminal all ok if weather ok but you could get soaked if raining hard as is normal at this time of year. Was selected for hand baggage and clothing swab for explosives. Security staff nice and friendly.,3,0
cairns-airport,Paul Harvey,,Flew into Cairns as an international passenger from Darwin - very easy airport and the nicest welcome we have had on our trips to Oz. At 8 am there were adequate staff on passport and security control our baggage arrived quickly and checking was done nicely and efficiently with apologies for using us as a training example to a new member of staff. We got a taxi downtown the only hicup was that the sign telling you to phone from the taxi pickup point (if there are none there) was missing so we waited 15 mins before someone came over to tell us to phone.,4,0
cairns-airport,A Gebhart,,Recently flew in and out of this airport on an international charter flight. I've been to Australia before and it is one of my favorite destinations in the world. However customs personnel upon arrival were unbelievably rude. You are not allowed to bring in food and I never carry food with me. However the sniffer dog indicated that I had food in my backpack. The customs official treated me like a criminal. After a thorough search of my backpack all he could find were cough drops. He turned on his heel and walked away with his dog and not another word. No apology of any kind. This is probably the rudest arrival I have ever experienced anywhere in the world and I travel quite a bit.,1,0
cairns-airport,S Srinivasan,,Used the Cairns domestic terminal recently. The arrivals area and baggage claim is a dump but the ticketing/check-in area and the departures area isn't bad. There's not much in the way of shopping or restaurants if you have time to kill and the seating areas are rather limited. The Qantas lounge is pretty decent and best of all it's a very short walk (just a couple of hundred feet) from the baggage claim to the taxi stand and about the same from the passenger drop-off area to the terminal entrance on arrival - though this makes the A$4 baggage cart rental fee a big rip-off. Taxis are also reasonably priced to the city despite the long distance.,4,0
cairns-airport,D walker,,Flew in and out of Cairns International recently and found the airport a breeze. Only a handful of carriers use the international terminal. Airside has all the usual stores duty free and a centre cafe. They even have a chocolate store. Great lounges and plenty of space with none of the crowds of other gateways airports to Australia. Would recommend to anyone arriving or leaving Australia.,5,0
cairns-airport,A Smith,,Cairns airport is a little run down but still functional. Only problem is the lack of a decent coffee and meal at the domestic airport! Hungry Jacks is always a crowd pleaser but when you need a good coffee at 5:00am its just not possible!,3,0
cairns-airport,Ron Villagracia,,I've only used the domestic portion (I fly via SYD) and while it is small and a bit run-down it's not a bad airport. In addition to the too-tiny baggage carousel the Virgin Blue check-in area needs to be rearranged a bit. The queue for computerized check-in became entangled in the queue for the baggage drop. The computerized check-in area needs to be moved further away. I also appreciated the centralized booking desk for the shuttles to town. On my last trip there I liked the convenience of on-site car rental and return but as with any Australian airport you pay an extra tax on the car that you wouldn't if you rented the car in town.,,0
cairns-airport,P Major,,The facilities at Cairns airport aren't all that bad; however arriving in Cairns on Jetstar or Virgin is a chore as both carriers use the same tiny belt in their dated arrivals area. Taxis are fairly quick to come through though. Departing is okay although a huge lineup at security meant it wasn't as efficient as it could have been. The real problem with the terminal is the Jetstar gates. People begin lining up well before they are even called and the small size of the terminal does not allow enough space for this. Luckily Jetstar are introducing allocated seating (finally) which will solve this problem at the start of November.,,0
cairns-airport,Andrew Wright,,I was fairly impressed by the range of retail stores available for international transit passengers at Cairns airport - mainly tropical touristy items but that reflects the city. Not a great range of eating places a hamburger bar sushi and Japanese snacks and a cafe with cakes and slices for sale. All shops and restaurants were open when we arrived at 6:30am. The airport incuding the bathrooms appeared pretty clean. Decent views of the runway from the transit area. All in all a fairly pleasant place to stop for a short time.,,0
cairns-airport,Mark Thomson,,Arrived at CNS airport on a Qantas flight from Brisbane and departed on an Australian Airlines flight to Singapore 4 hours later. The domestic and international terminals are linked by a covered and paved walkway and was a short and comfortable walk despite the heat (middle of the day on 26 December). Our luggage was tagged to SIN when we departed BNE so we didn't have to worry about lugging bags between terminals. CNS is not a big airport and doesn't have loads of retail outlets or much choice for food but the staff are friendly the terminal is modern and fresh the beer at the bar is cold and we spent the four hours comfortably. We went on to deal with the masses in SIN LHR AMS BKK and SYD airports and concluded that the smaller and more relaxed airport at CNS was the better of our experiences.,,0
cairns-airport,Mark Johnson,,While International Airport is very small and easy to walk from one end to the other the gate number signage as you go into the departures lounge is poor. Also there are not enough screens screens showing boarding and departure times and the relevant gate numbers.,,0
cairns-airport,Belinda Grohl,,A nice and comfortable little airport but were relatively frustrated by the staff. Myself and partner flew in to spend a 10 days in Port Douglas/Cairns area and could not remember the exact address of hotel - Air NZ hostess recommended we just write hotel name. Big mistake. Were questioned by police as well as customs officials bags scanned extra 3 times searched and looted through. Apparently they thought we were going to overstay in the country but the customs staff were extremely rude and definately ruined the start of the holiday. Both Air NZ and Qantas ground staff were very helpful though which improved the experience slightly!,,0
cairns-airport,Sally Heslop,,Departed from Cairns to London Heathrow via Tokyo for a family holiday. We were very impressed by the facilities offered at the airport especially in the departures lounge. Our only criticism would be that the departures lounge for international flights is locked until about 90mins before departure which meant that we had to hang around for 3 hours with little to do after arriving at the international terminal after a domestic flight. Otherwise a very welcoming airport which is bright and well designed.,,0
cairns-airport,Xuess Wee,,An airport that serves only 6 International Air carriers (I think) - it is breezily functional. Cool and modern the Australian airports tend to resemble each other - with little character to differentiate from each other. The Cairns Airport does look a little too big for its purpose. Check- in was fast and efficient though as there was minimal queue if any at all. Everything was done with little fuss and was much appreciated. Airport is only about 15-20 minutes away from the City Centre/Esplanade via Airport Shuttle Bus.,,0
cairns-airport,W Haskett,,I recently used the Cairns International Airport as my gateway into/out of Australia. It is a small airport with big value. There are only two terminals at the Cairns airport both of which can be comfortably walked end-to-end in 2 minutes. But there are no large crowds long line-ups. Customs clearance was fast and efficient (4 inspections questionings). There is a covered walkway between terminals which could be oppressively hot on a summer day but was quite enjoyable at 1 AM after flying for 20 hours. The domestic terminal is very quite at that time of night. They provide cushioned benches which could be cleaner but were welcome for a 5 hr layover.,,0
cairo-airport,Rob Barry,Egypt,"Cairo Airport Terminal 1 is one of the worst travel experiences I have encountered. Everything about the terminal is unpleasant; from arriving at the terminal to boarding your flight or indeed arriving at the terminal and leaving the terminal is beyond comprehension. What makes it more astounding is carriers such as Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways operate into the terminal. Bring on the new terminal, but when will it be completed?",1,0
cairo-airport,M McManus,Belgium,The airport is very badly sign posted and I found myself getting lost more than once something that has never happened to me in an airport before and I am a frequent traveler. You are often pestered by staff for a tip for even the most basic service. The selection of souvenirs was poor surprising given this is Egypt. The security arrangements seem illogical as you are screened by security twice just yards apart before check in. There is also a serious shortage of seating which is an issue if you are traveling with old or infirm people. Make sure you pre-arrange a pick up when arriving as fake cab drivers swarm around you on arrival if you appear to be looking lost.,2,0
cairo-airport,N Ibrahim,United States,Very poor Shuttle Service between terminals. We had to change buses between 2 Terminals. No instructions given the bus just stopped and driver got off. Passengers we looked at each other what should we do now? OK we changed buses on to the desired terminal then we are dropped off across the entrance in a parking lot not in front of the terminal entrance. So off we go pulling our suitcases. What ever happened to the people mover? No clear signs for Shuttle nor for the train between terminals.,5,0
cairo-airport,Rajorshi Chakraborty,India,"Visited Cairo for a conference at a glance during arrival the airport seemed ok clean not at all crowded Immigration was a breeze with only 1 counter operating out of about 30 counters toilets were clean and I was out of the airport in about 30 min. The real problem started when I was departing. Be prepared to get tired of hearing the word ""baaksheesh"" which means a tip. Every person you see shall approach you for a tip even if it is their duty. The airport doesn't offer free drinking water facilities you have to buy it. Announcements were excellent and they went the extra mile to announce in the language of the destination for International Flights.",5,1
cairo-airport,Jamil Itani,Lebanon,On 28/11/2014 I arrived to Cairo Airport on an MEA flight bounded from Beirut. The whole situation is in chaos. The smell in the airport is terrible. Immigration officers as well as customs officers are extremely rude and stubborn.,3,0
cairo-airport,J Lovelock,United Kingdom,"Pleasant modern airport not too big and not too small. Journey to and from Cairo is always fraught a shrug is the common response to asking how long you should allow but let's hope the Metro promised for next year materialises on time. But why can't the toilets have soap? And be less smelly? Why can't the ""FreeAirportWifi"" work? Why do the scamming porters who clamour to push your luggage 30 meters whether you protest or not and then ask for money apparently do so with the airport's blessing and wearing an official looking uniform? These are all national stereotypes but better airport management would roll them back a bit and encourage tourists back to Egypt.",7,1
cairo-airport,Mohamed Musa,Malaysia,"Flew from KL arrived with Emirates at CAI Terminal 1. This terminal is awful. Upon arrival people rushed to the immigration where only 5 counters were open both for Egyptians and foreigners resulting in long queue. Immigration officer was just rude threw my passport after stamping it. Waited for about half an hour for my luggage. Toilet beside the carousel dirty and disgusting. Before exiting the airport custom officer requested to see my passport and scan my luggage. After scanning them they asked for ""tips"" and won't let me pass through after I pay them some money. That's not it after exiting the terminal annoying taxi drivers started to surround and trying to take away my trolley. Thank god I had someone waiting for me. When we reached to our car two men out of nowhere came and grabbed our luggage and put them into the boot and then asked for tips. This whole arriving experience was nightmare. Overall it was a bad arriving experience after you have flown for 10+ hour flight.",,0
cairo-airport,David Pryer,United Kingdom,Terminal 1 is a bit chaotic but small and friendly enough to get through without too much trouble. With an early departure our hotel had prepared a breakfast selection bags for us all which along with our tots we had no difficulty with at any of the myriad security checks. Well done Cairo T1.,7,1
cairo-airport,R Haite,United States,"On most of my trips here in Egypt I have encountered extremely nice Egyptians. Today I arrived at the airport to leave and a guy came up to me as I am walking through the security check at the front asking me if I was flying with Lufthansa. He was wearing an employee tag over his neck so I thought he is an airport employee being helpful. I said yes and he grabbed my luggage set it down next to him and asked me for money. At this time another man came by also wearing tags and the younger one says ""give him money"". I gave the older man 20 Egyptian dollars. He proceeds to say ""give him (younger guy) money too"". At which point I said I don't have anymore money. He kept pressuring me saying US dollars will be okay too and I kept saying I don't have any. He pestered me all the way to the check in counter while holding on to my luggage almost hostage. After I told him many times that I don't have any more money he dropped my luggage on the floor and left. If Egypt wants to revive their tourism they really need to do something about this situation because now I am much less inclined to come back the next time I have vacation. What a terrible experience! Other than that the airport is new although not too fancy. Quite a selection of shops you can go to and food.",5,0
cairo-airport,Farouk Mogheth,Thailand,"Flew in and out from Doha. Terminal 1 is pleasant even though there are no jet bridges. The check in used to be mainly in the main hall (which is still there) but they decided to open 10 more at the back side and its quite a tight fit and very uncomfortable when it fills up with passengers. You definitely need to jump over many to get to passport control. Cairo is knows with every single staff trying to get some tips. Standing by the gate that clearly says ""Doha"" they ask me whether I am flying to Doha and as I reply yes they extend their palm and wish me a pleasant flight ""and wait for a tip"". I'm half Egyptian so I am used to it but can get real annoying after a while. Passport control is fast. Avoid Duty free that has nothing special. cafeteria exorbitant and overpriced. Word of advice. The gates are very very small so in case your flight is full and a wide body aircraft try and be one of the last to get to gate as its filled to the brim and very uncomfortable. When boarding starts everyone is everywhere.",5,1
cairo-airport,Irene Daskalakis,Greece,I was amazed to find the airport very clean and comfortable. At first I was very worried about what I would find as I had a 6 hrs layover in between flights. Most comments I had read online were very negative. However upon arrival I was pleased to find a fairly new and modern airport facility. All employees were very accommodating bathrooms were clean and food venues were great! The only negative aspect of my experience was the lack of proper internet. Although there is free WiFi it is so slow that it does not work.,7,1
cairo-airport,Anass Yasser,Egypt,The old terminal is nice but it needs more improvements in facilities and entertainment. It also has a nice apron view. The new terminal is excellent but more facilities are needed. All lounges are 3 stars they don't have showers and alcohol.,8,1
cairo-airport,L Osman,United Arab Emirates,Simply the most chaotic airport well not as chaotic as Jeddah airport however as a reputable country like Egypt should have a better terminal than this joke small claustrophobic building since the 1960s the most annoying issue was the people harassing you for taxis and limousines and for luggage assistance why it is not organized like everywhere else. 3 passport control desks during a busy period of the day with so many flights going everywhere queue felt like forever duty free is ridiculously expensive more expensive than market prices and than any other place in the world. Basic facilities in terms of cafes and restaurants dirty bathrooms couldn't even use it. How this is an airport in a country with tourists from everywhere. Have to use it every few months as family lives there.,4,0
cairo-airport,E Davies,Zimbabwe,Arrived from JNB early morning. Very expensive and poorly laid out. Unsmiling staff and very long queues to transfer. Toilets were filthy with no toilet paper or soap and no attendants around to ask for help.,4,0
cairo-airport,Farouk Mogheth,Thailand,Flew BKK-CAI-BKK and for arrival as well as for departure all went perfect with some minute issues. On arrival all went without a hitch from arrival (bussed to terminal) passport control and bags were delivered fast. The T3 is used by Egyptair and Star Alliance. Modern and airy. Official taxis at 6 am refused the official taximeter price but there was no other option. Departure was all right but the crowds at the first X-ray and checking the tickets as only passengers are allowed to the Check In counters. So many people and bit of chaos. Watch your bags as they seem to send them through the scanner and you end up stuck by the metal detector for your turn. Once you cross that everything else is s breeze. Check in took seconds passport control fast. Air side several interesting shops but I have to say they are truly expensive. So shame on you Cairo airport charging for a small 500ml bottle of normal water 25EGP when it costs roughly 1.5EGP. Second X-ray and documents check when entering the gate itself. The gates are well placed but there is no place to sit if the gate is still closed.,7,1
cairo-airport,Hany Anis Zakhary,United States,I was in Terminal 3 for a morning flight to Istanbul. I was very impressed with the airport cleanliness and facilities. The duty free shops had plenty of good and moderately priced merchandise. Moreover there were several food outlets all with good quality and satisfying different tastes. This airport is also good for transiting passengers.,10,1
cairo-airport,Adam Simmons,Spain,"For an airport which is less than 5 years old and which was (presumably) purpose-built for its home carrier Egyptair CAI is a horrific experience. The terminal is built in a V-shape  with F and G gates extending along the arms of the 'V'. H gates are for flights accessible by bus and the gates are downstairs at the base of the V. There is no real holding area where passengers can wait for their flights except two largeish restaurants. As a result the arms of the terminal (i.e. the F and G gates) are severely crammed with passengers awaiting flights. The layout of each arm means that access between the restaurants and the F/G gates re often blocked by passengers queuing for flights and every available seat was taken. I visit the airport twice in September. On the first occasion I was changing from Egyptair to Ethiopian (both international flights) and had to hand in my passport for it to be checked by immigration. Surely this contravenes the laws of international transit? I then had to go back downstairs to international arrivals to pick up my passport and get a re-issued boarding card one hour before departure of my ET flight. On the second trip I was changing between MS flights so I thought ""great no problem"". However my onward boarding card was handwritten and was forced to join the long international transit passenger queue by some unpleasant jobsworth. There were around 10 people behind the counter but only one was actually doing any work. It was only when a second official asked if anybody had an onward boarding card that I managed to queue-jump and get a re-issued printed boarding card quickly. Internet access is available outside one of the several lounges for Star Alliance Business/First class passengers. Finally there is a smoking room opposite gate F2 but this was simply disgusting: dirty too small and with just three chairs. If an airport is going to offer smoking facilities to its guests it should either do it properly or not at all.",,0
cairo-airport,M Prochnow,Germany,Perhaps some travelers are satisfied by a new airport building. I am happy if I must not stay at any airport for longer than necessary. Cairo is a very bad example for ignoring customers. My flight from Nairobi with Egyptair was delayed almost 90 minutes! There was no explanation and wrong information from airline staff. It would have been no problem to get the connection flights. But Cairo seems to want to avoid delays in their statistics. So they sent the connection flights.,2,0
cairo-airport,L Osman,United Arab Emirates,Flew to and from Cairo Intl T1 the old renovated terminal for all international airlines T3 is for Egyptair and star alliance which I try to avoid as much as possible since it is big and crowded T1 is small and sometimes can get congested as well but in my view still better. Arrived and bussed to terminal since there are no air bridges here arrival hall is a very small claustrophobic room not the cleanest however surprisingly didn't queue much for passport control. Waiting for luggage felt like forever taxi drivers trying to grab you and your luggage is still an annoying issue departure was a better experience. I prefer the coziness of T1 still in good shape and has a decent food and beverage outlets and small nice duty free though very annoying with the non stop flight announcements for departure and arrival I wonder why it was only in Arabic. Still better than the chaotic T3 and lets wait and see the outcome of the major renovation of T2.,6,1
cairo-airport,T Kofod,Denmark,A new terminal has been added to the old one - that means that when you arrive and remote parked there is a quite long drive to the terminal. As everything in Egypt arrival can be quite stressful you need to buy your entrance ticket (visa) by the exchange offices you might as well change money at the same time. Then you go through passport/visa control and then luggage area. you might be asked again for a passport check before leaving the airport. Coming out of terminal please hold on to everything you have as strangers will grab your luggage without asking and expect a tip. Even if you have an ordered transfer they let the strangers take it - everybody makes the most out of emptying the tourists pockets. In case you are arriving at international and need a connecting domestic flight it can be a bit tricky but follow the signs and ask your way to a small corridor - which by the way is a very popular praying area. When you arrive at the airport terminal touts will round you up and ask if you are flying Egyptair (it is the Egyptair terminal so of course you are) they pretend they are VIP handlers and take your luggage to first security screening demanding money before you enter. Check in is slow. Until you reach your plane you will be subjected to 4-6 security checks and many of them ask you to pay tips - even cleaning staff will follow you into the toilets handing you toilet paper and ask for money. There are shops and eateries which are overpriced. Use all Egyptian pounds before entering the terminal- they do not change it back. When boarding first you go through security screening then one person checks your boarding card and passport then you walk 1 meter and a new security person checks your boarding card and passport - and before you enter the airplane another security person checks your boarding card.,4,0
cairo-airport,Farouk Mogheth,Thailand,Flew in and out from Cairo airport with KLM (Business Class). Skyteam flies to terminal 1 (the face lifted old terminal with no sky bridges). Its a nice terminal since T2 is in complete renovation and I suspect they will return there and T3 is only Egyptair and Star Alliance. Arrival was on time but many passengers as there were 2 planes from Saudi Arabia. Bags already waiting and out in no time. Taxis hunting for arrivals so a good idea to avoid them and take an official taxi to avoid rip off. NO Sky Priority for any Business class passengers. Departure was a breeze at check in. No priority fro C class passengers at passport control. Couple of nice shops and cafes. The C class lounge is quiet and nice with non-functional internet which managed to irk most guests. The holding boarding gate is too small to hold a full B777 so it caused great discomfort to passengers and the numerable carts and wheelchairs. Very claustrophobic. Bussing to and the terminal is OK. T3 is far better to handle crowds and is up to par with other international airports. T1 is functional but needs a little help.,6,1
cairo-airport,T Jones,Australia,I flew into and out of terminal 3. Check-in was ok with a little wait and some confusion over which was the right desk to check into. My main issue was with the price of the food drinks and duty free. I know airport prices are usually high but this was ridiculous. A bottle of water which costs 1.50 EGP in the street cost 10 EGP - a very high markup indeed. Main message - eat before and bring drinks/snacks for the terminal/plane. On arrival we had to jump on a bus to get to the terminal itself from the plane but after that the passport area was easy to pass through (we already had a visa) baggage collection no worries and then customs didn't even bother to check our bags. As others have said the most annoying part of arrival is the tour guides/taxi drivers you run into after leaving the arrivals area. Yes the airport should at least keep them out of the terminal and have a proper system to deal with taxis. Try to pre-arrange transport if you can and if you can't ask the place you are staying for a fair estimate of a taxi fare and only get in a taxi that agrees to your fare. If you are after an experience and not sweat the small stuff you will be rewarded greatly.,6,1
cairo-airport,Franz Linz,Austria,I think I was surprised to experience such a modern airport in Africa I fly frequently to different cities in Africa and I mostly face terrible and hard times with every flight. Last week I flew Egyptair to a transit in Cairo with a connection to Lagos. The airport is clean nice well organized and easy to move in.,9,1
cairo-airport,A Stevenson,United Kingdom,Cairo T3. Arrival from Sharm for connection to Heathrow. Incoming aircraft parked at a remote stand and we were bussed via what seemed a circuitous route to the terminal. Followed directions for flight transfer to reach emigration; this takes place in a small room with just a couple of desks and embarkation cards are only handed out as you enter this room. Cue lots of passengers suddenly dropping bags and scrabbling around for pens passports and flight details. Emigration officers rather brusque. Once processed proceeded into the main terminal building which is modern slick and attractive with all the facilities you would expect. Only complaint – gate for flight to London hadn't been opened when I reached it and there was limited seating in the pier outside. Once open security again rather brusque but plentiful seating at gate itself.,6,1
cairo-airport,J Walsh,United States,Going through the much-touted terminal three there was nothing open for a morning departure - save for Duty Free and a handful of snack bars. Surprisingly I encountered no shakedown attempts from employees but then again the airport is understaffed. Arrival in terminal 1 was uneventful but still confusing. It's not as if you'll have many other options if you're flying to Egypt and are on a tight schedule.,4,1
cairo-airport,David Healey,Egypt,Truly one of the most awful airport experiences I have encountered. From the minute you land you are hassled by 'officials' offering taxis trips to pyramids. Trying to get free shuttle bus from terminal 3 to terminal 1 you will be told there isn't one a taxi will offer to take you the 2km journey for $10 which should only be $2. Airport staff grab your bags and take to x-ray machines and then expect a gift. As somebody who lives in Egypt I try to avoid this airport and would rather fly out of Sharm to England.,2,0
cairo-airport,Judith Dand,Turkey,I passed through Terminal 3 when flying from Istanbul to Luxor and was pleasantly surprised. On arrival the visa windows were well signposted and immigration quite efficient. I made my way to the Domestic floor without being hassled by anyone indeed there only seemed to be about a dozen people in the whole Terminal. Quiet clean plenty of places to sit or get coffee water and something to eat. On return from Luxor I just followed the signs for connecting flights and went quickly through security only to find my Egyptair flight to Istanbul was delayed by 55 minutes. But there were shops to look at and decent looking food outlets too.,9,1
cairo-airport,P Dounias,Norway,Cairo airport must be the most awkward airport in the world. I have flown through all 3 terminals so I know it quite well. There is no point in referring to the appalling terminal 2 as it is no longer in operation. The quality of staff and security processes are the biggest issues in my opinion. Regarding the staff there seems to be a scam between airport officials and taxi drivers to hand you over to the drivers that will rip you off. If you can prearrange transport you will be able to avoid that. There are 2 members of staff at passport control. The first will look at your passport and put the visa sticker on it and the second one will stamp it. And they both sit side by side. You have to security scan your suitcases before you check-in which causes absolute chaos. The stories are endless about this airport. On the up it is a clean airport modern and spacious with good duty free and good dinning options. And I have to say I have seen some improvements over the last 2 years which shows that Egyptians are making an effort to improve it.,4,1
cairo-airport,Sheryar Khajotia,Pakistan,Upon arrival before passport control touts approach you trying to get money for helping you through immigration or for organizing taxis. Completely unnecessary help! Departure hall chaotic and people smoking everywhere. Filthy toilets. Hard to understand how a country with tourism being so important and with special tourist police doesn't do anything about the airport.,1,0
cairo-airport,C Hall,United States,"Arrived at 2am from Amsterdam. Immigration was quick and easy. Bags arrived quickly. Went to airport shuttle without any issues. However the departure from Terminal 1 was horrible. From the moment I was dropped off I was hounded with offers to ""help"". Additionally the airport employees are definitely part of the scheme to mis-guide you leading you to a position where you feel like you have to pay someone to get you to the correct place. The trip to Cairo was great but the lack of organization and the constant attempts to take money from you really soured the departure.",3,0
cairo-airport,N Farlinghand,Canada,"Arrived late at night on Air France and were towed to a remote gate. Bussed for ages to Terminal 3 for customs. The agent was cold and rude not pleasant after a long 2 days of flying. He only gave some of our group arrival stamps which was strange. The terminal itself was beautiful and very western except for broken toilets in the bathrooms. The next morning the 5am Egyptair to Aswan. The terminal requires security to reach check in then once again at the gate. I don't think they even looked at the first screening. The airport was clean and very modern. Boarding through the gate was strange as a man opened the door and simply said ""time to board"" not through a PA system or anything. Departing on Air france a week later through terminal 1 was crazy. People can pay security a few dollars to jump ahead cutting our group of kids into chunks. Check in was painfully slow but that is the airline's fault. Customs heading out was fast and the man gave me a strange look for not having an arrivals stamp. At the gate one metal detector was there to screen our airbus 330! Again 5 pounds and passengers were escorted to the front of the line. We were then bussed out to our plane back to the civilized world.",3,0
cairo-airport,Michael Schade,Singapore,Cairo terminal 3 is spacious with great Star Alliances lounges and efficient check in/immigration facilities. It took less than 30 minutes from touch down to be on a cab to town.,4,0
cairo-airport,M Lavingia,United Kingdom,Flying Dar-es-salaam to London last week I had to transit for 5 hours in Cairo. They gave all transit passengers to London a free city tour of Cairo for 3 hours! Lunch was also included which was a take away lunch box from a local restaurant. They even sorted out all the visa formalities for all of us.,4,0
cairo-airport,Farouk Mogheth,,"My return flight from Cairo has left a bit of a sour taste. I think that ""tea money"" or bakshish was requested virtually on each step from check in till boarding which is something I haven't experienced yet in CAI airport before. It started when I flew from Munich to Cairo T3 where I had a 2 days stop over. Passport control was fast which is great after that and 2 meters from passport control a police officer re-checks your passport to see the entry stamp. You go to puck up your bags and there it starts. When you see your bag and go to get it then you find a couple of guys trying to help you forcefully and then expect tea money as they specifically said it. I go through the ""green zone"" which practically isn't that green as everyone is being controlled. Check passport again and open bags. close bags and ""welcome to Cairo any chance for tea money sir?"". The arrival hall is empty as all waiting people were kicked out for some reason or another. My departure for Bangkok was definitely an experience. I will count passport checks and tea money from my check in to boarding! TO enter the hall and the check in area then you have to be only a passenger - so I got my passport checked and the gentleman wished me a pleasant flight and some tea money. I go to Xrays to enter the check in area so I get my passport checked and the officer smiled and asked if I had any tea money. I go to check in that took longer than its supposed to. Each check in counter has a gentleman to help the bags on the scales. Since I had only a small bag I helped myself and my passport checked and tea money was asked by the helper. I proceed to Passport control and go through with ease. I proceed to the gate where the passport is checked and went again through x rays while boarding at the door the passports were checked again and I was once again asked for tea money. I was annoyed by that stage - going through he airbridge to the plane and what do we have there - a gentleman controlling my passport I mean security is a good thing but this is a bit weird. I would like to rest assured tourists will be spared much of the tea money (not a guarantee) since I am part Egyptian and look so. So the terminal can be as clean and modern as can be but his has topped any experience that I had.",2,0
cairo-airport,Farouk Mogheth,,"What a difference a Terminal makes. Terminal 2 still is a joke and an embarrassment. Terminal 3 is the first time I felt like flying to Cairo and actually landing in an airport that is closer to standards. The new terminal is however used only by Egyptair and Star alliance. The terminal building is airy and clean sufficient amount of shops and cafes walking distances are not that far. The access taxiways to the terminal takes ages so the planes taxing was around 25min! The negative points are more because of local habits. For the first time I met a female passport control officer who was rude for that I am taking 2 stars off. Only passengers can enter the terminal building even the waiting areas. If you are not a passenger then you have to ""buy"" a ticket which is a bit annoying as they sent us 600m away to a stall to get the ticket. I realize that this is to control the crowds and the ""taxi drivers"" who hunt for arrivals but this is not the way to do it. Only passengers are allowed al the way to check in counters! Check in agents helpful and a young crowd. So I guess its a far better place than I have experienced in an Egyptian airport.",3,0
cairo-airport,Charles Ganley,,Chaos seems to be the order of the day at this airport for arrivals and departures. Give yourself lots of time for check-in. Road access is very circuitous could not find indicators/screens to advise of arrivals and departures in Terminal 1 arrivals hall transfers from one terminal to another was convoluted. Be aware of Islamic holidays and other special times when the crowds are checking in.,2,0
cairo-airport,Craig Robinson,,"Went through terminal 2 on flight to/from Doha on Qatar Airways. On arrival I was hustled by various people who wanted to ""help"" me find a taxi etc. even before immigration. This terminal is a mess! The building is old and run down. On the way home food was poor and overpriced and staff are either not interested or looking for some kind of tip. Really it's not a pleasant place to spend two hours and does not give a good first impression on arrival. On the other hand I flew domestic on EgyptAir through new terminal 3 building during my visit to Egypt which was a much better experience although signage and announcements were lacking. Keep an eye on the boards as they can change without warning!",2,0
cairo-airport,G Simmonds,,Arrived from JFK to CAI new terminal. Facilities were neat immigration fast customs a bit confusing . Long wait for luggage but finally arrived. Terminal building was nice modern  signage sufficient staff a bit disorganized but finally everything fell in it's place.,3,0
cairo-airport,P Jones,,I have flown a number of flights through the new T3. Better traffic control outside newer/modern look alcohol available in bar/restaurant many gates with walkways fairly efficient check in and passport control departing. The bad - business class lounge (they just opened a second Egyptair this last week) are poor - the attendant told me they would be opening up a nicer one in a matter of months frequently claim a gate is open when it isn't so you walk all the way and are stuck in a hall with a bunch of other people in front of the closed gate (and you have to go through security again) and on arrival the scene at passport control is pure chaos! I spent 30+ minutes in the business/first class line because they allowed individuals with group passports (5-10 passports in a stack) to cut ahead of the business and first class passengers in line! The other lines were extremely long and extremely slow. And also bad is you still get stuck using a bus despite them having open gates and the drive from plane to terminal is a good fifteen minutes. So overall I'm pretty disappointed and actually preferred terminal one with its McDonalds Starbucks and Cinnebon (none of which have a franchise in T3).,3,0
cairo-airport,P Bischoff,,I am using Cairo airport on a regular basis (T1 and T2) and it is not really an enjoyable place to get through. CAI is just disorganised people jump queues crowd control at departure is inexistant signage is inconsistent and the chaos at passport control (Terminal 1) is something worth being filmed although immigration officers do an obvious effort to be polite on arrival. Options for transport to the city vary between shabby taxis and being ripped off by so called limousine agencies. No trains or decent buses are available. Terminal 3 has recently opened and let's hope that is gives a better image of the country.,1,0
cairo-airport,K Davids,,Complete nightmare avoid this airport at all costs. Badly laid out and staff are rude and unhelpful. Overpriced food dirty bathrooms generally unpleasant. Smokers everywhere.

cairo-airport,Lisbeth Dore,,"Absolutely horrible! Upon arrival before passport control aggressive touts approach you form all sides trying to get money for helping you trough immigration or for organising taxis. Completely unnecessary ""help""!

cairo-airport,Moustafa Ezz,,Arrival in Terminal 1 was disappointing building seemed old and was rather crowded. No organised lines whatsoever and complete chaos. However departure from same terminal (Terminal 1) was a different story. Departure seems very new large LCD screens displaying flight information organized check-in desksmany immigration kiosks. There were many food outlets such as McDonald's Starbucks Cinnabon etc. The airport-facing side of the waiting area is all glass which enables you to watch all the planes. Hopefully issues concerning departure will be solved with the opening of Terminal 3 this month.,4,0
cairo-airport,Andrew Stuckles,,Arrived in original older terminal. Old dilapidated and poorly signed. I'm not sure where I was supposed to obtain a visa (I had one already in my passport from consulate at home). Baggage gathering was straightforward but a little chaotic. It took me a good half hour to get my luggage. Departure terminal was fine. Beware of crooked people who pretend to be airport staff but are just looking for tips. Otherwise modern airport after you go through security. McDonald's Star Bucks and a few other shops. Smoking is permitted in certain areas and one room.,4,0
cairo-airport,Alain Kupferman,,"The arrival in the new airport went very smoothly but the international departure hall is a total mess. There is a separate Star Alliance/Egyptair business section giving the privilege to have longer queues than in the economy main hall. Signs are confusing plenty of people around trying to ""guide"" you for faster processing against a tip in all a miserable place.",2,0
cairo-airport,K Jasmin,,"I arrived and departed to Madrid on IB and also domestic on EgyptAir. Signs and announcements are confusing was given wrong departure gate and staff are unresponsive and unhelpful. Terminal sheathed in decaying white ceramic makes it seem like an old WC. It took 2 hours to get past security and immigration long queues and total chaos and no food except one cafe with sweets and bread both not recommended. Very hungry. Domestic Arrivals much worse. No working signs at all in baggage reclaim only 2 working belts for all flights so luggage split across more than one belt extremely over crowded and no information. Wasted 90 mins locating luggage. Touts all around arrivals to ""help"" with luggage taxis whatever. No control or rules at all. Very aggressive hassle in taxi area. New terminal should now be open may be better structurally but I doubt will help resolve biggest problem of general disorder and confusion is worker issue not infrastructure. New metro line will avoid taxi touts though. Not recommended for transfer passengers but if flying onward in Egypt or to/from Cairo no real choice.",1,0
cairo-airport,S Siebesma,,One of the worst transit-airports ever. Flew business class from Amman to Cairo (with Royal Jordanian) and on to Nairobi (with Kenya Airways). Upon arrival a bus took me to one terminal where I had to wait ten minutes before boarding another bus to another terminal where I had to hand in my passport and had to wait 25 minutes (no explanation given) before my passport was returned to me. I then boarded a third bus which took me back to the other terminal. There the whole thing started again. Handed in my passport and e-ticket to immigration and had to wait for over half an hour (people smoking all around me) before I got my passport back this time with boarding pass. All with all a very time consuming procedure. The business class lounge is very small and asking for a drink feels like asking a big favour. Staff very unfriendly. All with all this airport is not to be advised for anyone flying in/out with two different airlines.,1,0
cairo-airport,Arun Anand,,Probably the worst international airport - absolute mess in all aspects. Huge queues for immigration on arrival and chaotic baggage collection with no clear boards mentioning the flight name. Airport full of touts to assist in passport control taxis hotels etc and no one seems to be bothered to control or regulate them. Departure was worse and resembled a cattle market to put it mildly. Huge queues everywhere from baggage screening to check in to passport control. No clear announcements and all boards are totally worn out. Total disregard for smoking rules thru out the terminal. No places to sit before check in. Toilets are very dirty and unmaintained. Duty free is a joke with items priced several times the price outside and first class lounge ridiculous. Hardly any food on offer and in noon all I could see was stale bread and pastries from morning. An absolute shame for a country which houses so many tourist marvels and attracts millions every year. Probably thats the reason no one is bothered at any cost people have to use this airport to come to Egypt. If there is any ranking less than zero I would give that!,1,0
cairo-airport,M Albarda,,Cairo Terminal 1. BA requested our presence three hours before the 8:35 AM departure and I duly showed up. The security people however did not start screening until 2.5 hours before so a long single form line for all classes was the result. In fact apart from the check-in counter nowhere in the entire process of boarding are there dedicated First Business or Elite Customer lines. The BA check in staff were unaware of the arrival terminal change in Heathrow (not T5 thank goodness but T4). I found out as I was trying to understand where my connecting Heathrow Delta flight to Atlanta was departing from (turned out to be T4 as well). The Cairo International terminal BA uses is old.A new terminal is in the process of being built which surely will bring a better quality pre-flight experience. As it is BA offers the use of a generic lounge which is small with very old and not entirely clean looking furniture and a TV tuned to Al Jazeera. There are two old nondescript standard and not entirely clean fridges carrying somewhat cold water and soft drinks. There was nobody manning the bar and there was no food apart from nuts despite this being an early AM departure. There was free wireless internet. I went out to find some breakfast and ended up in a coffee shop which served fresh croissants. The terminal offers some shopping but many were closed at this early hour. The lighting in the terminal is harsh and the use of tiles everywhere creates a sterile and impersonal cold atmosphere. Boarding was the worst chaos of all. All passengers were hoarded into a pre-boarding area. The two BA representatives scanned all boarding passes but did not offer any assistance to people in wheel chairs (there were about 5 on this flight) or people with small children. A lone police man started checking passports when the door for boarding opened and it was each man woman and disabled person for themselves… A shambles. All in all the fact that a new terminal is being built is absolutely necessary. But for the time being you might be better off traveling on one of the Sky Team airlines as they depart from the already opened new Terminal 2.,2,0
calcutta-airport,O Lloyd,,Calcutta Airport has come up to speed in the recent years and it's about time too! I only used to fly into CCU because it was the closest International Airport to Orissa and cut my journey time by a day. However it was always a tiring and bothersome task fighting my way through the immigration and baggage handling policies they seemed to practice - slow slower and at one stage stop! Flying in wasn't too bad - on a good day I could be off the plane and in a taxi within the hour (depending on the carrier). However departing from CCU was a chore - Immigration then check your baggage tags to bags then Passport Control then a small tussle with Security and Baggage Check then finally the (what seemed like a mile) hike to the plane! However those days are gone if you fly in with BA - they insisted on a proper Gate being constructed and it is now up and running! Much to my delight it's just a hop and a skip to the plane and then you're on your way. Yes you still have to grapple with Security and Passport Control but the last three times I have flown into/out of CCU I have been spared the ordeal of searching for my bags and tallying them up with my ticket tags.,,0
calgary-airport,J Rodriguez,Canada,I can't believe that it took me 45 minutes to get through one domestic security line-up! Good thing I gave myself 3 hours allowance to fly domestic. I have never seen such a slow security check. There were 5 lines but only two were operational and one of them was for Nexus. However there were at least 6 personnel being trained on the functioning machines and so many other personnel hovering around. When my husband asked why it's taking so long the staff said no it's not taking long and one personnel said that everyone came together all of a sudden. I don't think this airport is equipped to handle massive amounts of passengers. Then my husband's backpack was searched for the hand scale that he had in his bag. Meanwhile I had the same hand scale in my backpack and my bag was not searched. Such inconsistencies and inefficiencies. I travel around the world frequently and I have not seen such slow-paced and inconsistent security check point.,2,0
calgary-airport,Sahil Kale,Canada,"This Airport is an airport that supports your needs. Food was great and staff were helpful. The signage was helpful in guiding us to the correct area for check-in and I don't have to keep asking every single staff member I meet to ask ""Where is ..."" Departure: Once past check-in you can enjoy views of the aircraft or eat or if you are late go to security. Once there you go past like a breeze (Full Queen = 10-15 Min. wait time). After that there are shops offering travel comforts (e.g. Headphones Neck rests pillows toothbrushes etc.) and coffee shops are there. US pre-clearance is also good and takes ~5 min. per person (if you are a normal traveler). The US pre-clearance features shops. Arrivals: After you arrive head up the stairs wait ~20 min. on average and you are out of there.",10,1
calgary-airport,S Katt,Canada,While the US-Transborder areas are atrocious for food options and lounges the airport as a whole is not bad. Checking in is easy (usually) and is made easier if you are elite security has long queues through the transborder checkpoint but this is resolved by using the NEXUS lane (if you have one) (it is a great investment) and that brings me to Customs and Immigration. The CBSA hall is quite a trek from your arrival gate but it isn't as bad as LHR T2. Once at the checkpoint the officers are polite and if you have NEXUS you can be out of customs in 2 mins. Going through US CBP on the way to the US takes a bit longer though agents are generally polite and expedient. Back to NEXUS (there's a theme forming here). If you apply and get accepted you also get Global Entry benefits for US CBP so if you have it US CBP is also 2 mins. Sorry for skipping around here but the gate area for domestic flights (Concourses A and D) is big enough to find something to eat and somewhere to eat it and also has Lounges if you are so inclined. Transborder; (Concourse C) Is another story. It has very limited food options due to the opening and closing of gates for transborder traffic (if you've travelled through YYC you know what I mean) restrooms are few and far between and there is only one (paid entry) lounge which is nice for getting to the airport early but it is really not worth it. I guess a suitable end to this review is Baggage and well the few times I have checked a bag at YYC it has been about a 5-15 min wait domestically and 30-45 mins for international arrivals. I'm truly shocked if you're still reading at this point but in conclusion; most of the gripes I have about lines and food options should be solved in October 2105 when the IFP opens.,7,1
calgary-airport,M Smith,United Kingdom,Have been through Calgary airport several times in transit from UK. It has never been good but last October very poor. I could not believe the surly robotic attitude of the security staff. If this is the welcoming face of Canada to visitors I wouldn't plan on increased tourism. This time as I write having just missed my connecting flight by minutes because the ground crew spent over 20 minutes connecting the bridge to deplane from my UK flight. Again miserable faced security and after 17hours travelling I can't even relax with a smoke without exiting the airport and facing the happy crew again to get back in. Regrettably I am due to transit through this Mickey mouse airport again this year but I will make efforts to change to Vancouver. Avoid this place if possible.,,0
calgary-airport,J Schamotta,Canada,The walk from your international flight to customs is excessive. I can normally handle some walking but this is awful. I need to stop numerous times just to rest. Every time I come through Calgary customs I swear I won't travel again but after a few months pass I gear myself up for the walk. May consider asking for a wheelchair next time. Will this improve with the new addition?,5,1
calgary-airport,M Cooper,United States,Going through customs takes about an hour then you get to security! Which takes an hour. Above all that you have to verify your passport at the gate. Now you get to the gate and decide you're hungry. You walk past your gate and see a nice looking sandwich shop and a couple of shops behind a glass wall however there is no door to get to them. If we can't go to some wing of the airport don't show us! Avoid this airport at any cost.,,0
calgary-airport,Y Chen,Canada,The slowest airport! To go through US custom declaration it takes about 2.5 hrs. Domestic security check takes about 40 min. The security staff are rude and disrespectful. If you have been to Las Vegas expect a full search and invasion of privacy. Airport parking is by far the most expensive in North America.,,0
calgary-airport,Tonii Roulston,Canada,Calgary Airport: first you have to walk several minutes to get to customs. It is usually a different route with a variety of hallways. Then you wait for your bags for 40 minutes. The sign of course tells you that your bags will be 4 minutes. Eventually the explanation provided is that there is only 1 ground crew. Surely planes are scheduled and that bags will be on the plane can be anticipated. This is a business run it as one and not as a government entity where there is simply no responsibility.,4,1
calgary-airport,Christian Edwards,United Kingdom,I have been going to Calgary airport for many years because I lived in the nearby city Lethbridge and I have had excellent service with this airport. The toilets are cleaned every 1 hour and they are well cleaned and the airport itself has easy access for the disabled.,10,1
calgary-airport,Shant Tepelekian,United States,The airport was very clean but the food that was available was not so good. It was very nice to have the Spaceport so the kids can play. Overall this was a very good airport.,8,1
calgary-airport,J Patterson,Canada,"Overall Calgary is a pretty good airport but food service on the international side is horrendous. ""The Pub"" (why it's named that I have no idea) is some of the worst food you will have in an airport. The other choices are Burger King and Tim Hortons. They have very limited seating. There is no access to the Air Canada lounge from the International side either.",8,1
calgary-airport,C Johnson,Canada,I had my flight cancelled first thing (9am) Sunday December 30th with no options but to fly out later that night (10.30 pm). Security staff were most accommodating in allowing me to go back through the security check despite the fact I was flying out much later that day. I had checked out of my hotel and really had no other option than to stay in the airport during this time.,10,1
calgary-airport,Maxim Doubrovine,Canada,I fly to and from here 4 or 5 times a year. Queues at the check in counters are usually short and staff are friendly for the most part. The airport is clean and if you have any questions you can get help. Security and border staff are usually pretty friendly. There is a very big selection of places to eat whether you want a donut and coffee or you want a full meal - you'll find a lot of places to get some food. Duty free prices are very very cheap. Lots of seating available throughout the airport. Free high speed wifi is available and always works. 30 minutes of parking is free at the airport and there are lots of long-term parking choices too. Baggage comes out really fast most of the time. Highly recommend this airport - it's excellent.,10,1
calgary-airport,J Gerber,Canada,Even though it may lack in some things as size and entertainment it makes up for it in others as soon YYC will soon be able to handle A380's and 747-8 plus a new terminal and runway. There has only once in my lifetime been a big issue with this airport and that was easily resolved!,10,1
calgary-airport,J Winter,Canada,"The first airport I ever did a connecting flight in so obviously I was a little nervous getting there however the majority of the staff was helpful in directing a poor lost person in the right direction. The layout was sometimes confusing and I had a difficult time trying to find customs but it's a beautiful well kept airport with lots of shopping and restaurants to keep you occupied. And might I add the most comfortable seating out of any airport that I've been to. The only issue I had was after I found my gate and waited out my 3 hour layover I discovered that they'd put the wrong gate number on my ticket so when I approached the man at the desk of the gate my boarding pass and the electronic boards said I needed to be at and asked him where I should be he replied ""I don't know"" and dismissed me. So I almost missed my flight trying to find the appropriate gate. However overall I would say that this is a beautiful fast and mostly friendly airport which I would definitely return to in the future.",9,1
calgary-airport,M Koristka,Canada,I fly out of this airport at least once a year with WestJet airlines and I am always impressed right from the check-in counter all the way to the gate. It could use more short-term parking though.,9,1
calgary-airport,E Rustand,Canada,Nice airport until you get into the security zone. Was transferring at this airport. It has a bit of an odd setup. It feels like a big long strip mall. It was quite a hike from where the plane let me off to customs. Decor and overall quality was good. After customs the main part of the airport is nice. Good restaurants in the food court and an excellent view while eating. Security was pretty brisk. One warning though. After you get through security the gate area is almost devoid of bathrooms! There is one bathroom upstairs and one downstairs this was for hundreds of waiting passengers. Overall not bad but please Calgary install a couple more toilets.,6,1
calgary-airport,L Keckalo,Canada,We arrived from Kelowna at 8.30am on a Saturday to catch a connecting flight to Orlando at 9.45am. To claim our bags prior to US customs we had to get past others that were lined up drag luggage back around people in line then watch while others barged ahead of everyone. The layout of that area could be improved greatly. There was a very long line to enter customs and when we finally arrived at our gate the flight was already boarding. While the airport appeared to be nice and clean I will avoid it in the future if we have a US connection under 2 hours.,7,1
calgary-airport,Susan Allen,Canada,Going through US customs was ridiculous. If this is the city airlines choose to fly so many direct flights into the States from the prairies the airport needs to streamline this process to get passengers through in a more efficient/timely manner. Delayed flights/connections are the biggest frustration for a passenger. I have flown into many larger airports that get this done.,4,0

calgary-airport,Ivan Markovic,Canada,The terminal is quite small for a city of it's size. There is not a lot of shops except for the occasional Tim Horton's. However I've never had any problems with check-in customs line ups and security. The good part is that customs are very fast and efficient in the airport because it's not as busy. I think the terminal is in need of major renovation.,2,0
calgary-airport,A Merchant,United Kingdom,In arrivals there are plenty of people in cowboy hats who can offer assistance if you get stuck with anything which is useful. You can buy a day pass for $8 from Mac’s convenience store. Unfortunately the bus is the only means of transport to downtown and express buses run every half hour to downtown. The departures area was more modern than arrivals and there were a good number of places to eat and shop after passing through security (no problems there). The airport itself is fine but for the lack of a direct rail link from the airport.,5,0
calgary-airport,Ed Smith,United Kingdom,Recently flew into YYC on an international flight and then out again a few days later on a domestic flight - on the whole I found the experience to be rather good. I love the fact that they have the friendly greeters in white Stetsons it certainly makes you feel you have arrived somewhere different also love the fact that they help people with mobility problems or young children by giving them a lift on the golf buggies from the airbridge to customs. This was brought into sharp contrast on arrival back at Manchester with the ludicrous up and down stairs long and winding walk you have to do on arrival. The customs guys were certainly abrupt but no more than I had experienced in other parts of Canada - in fact they only asked us 2 quick questions before letting us through - other groups of passengers seemed to get far more of a grilling. Baggage reclaim was really fast signage to rental cars was easy to follow and I'd say we were completely out of the airport within 1hr of landing which is not bad at all. Flying out was positive too - had heard rumours that the security staff could be quite rude but if anything they were a bit too friendly. Decent selection of shops and food outlets and a great seating area with nice views of the airfield and the Calgary skyline in the distance. Very good experience on the whole.,5,0
calgary-airport,Susan Madge,Australia,Re B Cronin's comments on Calgary Airport Customs staff; I think this person is far too kind in their comments on these Customs staff! Fortunately I was a little quicker than B Cronin and was able to catch my thrown passport as it flew off the counter but was unable to understand the hostility engendered by our flying in from the USA rather than direct from Australia. The level of enmity was unbelievable. We will not make the same mistake again.,1,0
calgary-airport,R Stephenson,Canada,Decent airport with very good shopping options (primarily before security). Newest concourse D is quite nice. Some parts really showing their age - US departures area is utterly awful as are B gates. Also a total lack of any real services or shopping in the C (USA) gate area. U.S. Customs clearance wait times can be horrendous. Wayfinding signage is ridiculous awful horrible amateur in some places! Best example: exiting the customs hall. When the first batch of amateur signage confused passengers they put up more. That clearly didn't help so they put up more. Then somebody installed red LED signs with flashing words and arrows (which are just as poorly designed as all of the other attempts). Now someone else has tried to rectify by putting up handmade and laser-printer-ed signs. The signage is so bad that it's laughable but it's also a sad way to welcome people to Calgary.,4,0
calgary-airport,B Cronin,United Kingdom,Calgary Airport is an efficient airport and should allow rapid transit for visitors and business people alike. I have one problem which happens every time I arrive at Calgary and it continues to astonish me and upset me every time it happens. I arrive on BA flights direct from London once or twice a year. We are greeted by the friendly folk with the cowboy hats and then to the customs officers where the hell begins. Of my last seven visits I have been treated with a level of hostility abruptness and intrusiveness that leaves me flabbergasted. On Saturday the customs official tossed my documentation back at me it actually fell off the counter. On a previous two occasions I was sent to the 'back room' for a grilling. Beware not crossing a line with 'do not cross until called' sign (usually swinging to the side unseen). Even it there is no queue under no circumstances approach the officer unless they call you forward. On Saturday she seemed peeved to have lost the opportunity to berate me. Oh yes visitors to Calgary beware. For here you may find the most sour deliberately antagonistic unprofessional and deeply unhuman officials. If only the lovely citizens of this great country knew how some visitors were being treated in their name.,2,0
calgary-airport,Richard Boblenz,United States,Our journey to Calgary and passage through Canadian Customs was happily achieved with no delays with no waiting lines and up to ten Canadian Customs officers on duty. Our return trip from Calgary to Philadelphia via Chicago was very trying for many reasons. We arrived at YYC at 2 pm two hours before our flight to learn that our flight was delayed to 5-20 pm. Although a sign stated that we were barred from entering customs until two hours before our flight time no one advised us that it would take more than ninety minutes to pass through US Customs and YYC Airport Security. We entered US Customs at 4:00 pm at which point the waiting line was backed up outside the door from the terminal with only two US Customs officials on duty and a third serving flight crews and a supervisor doing nothing. There was a fourth official person circulating through the waiting crowd assuring all that no one would miss their flights. We asked him about our Chicago flight and he assured us that our flight would not leave without us. A full one hour later we finally got to the front of the line cleared US Customs and proceeded around the corner to arrive at YYC Airport Security and we realized that there were three lines open and only one of the lines was actually moving. It took 40 minutes to clear Airport Security who were opening every single bag and patting down nearly every passenger; including those who passed the metal detector. So we finally exited YYC Airport Security at 5:40 pm and went to Gate 31 but our flight had already departed at 5:20pm. The result of this is that we were then sent back through Canadian Customs to return to United ticketing with the knowledge that we were destined to suffer through US Customs and YYC Airport Security again before departing Calgary. We were then presented with another line of at least an hour at Canadian Customs. However after about ten minutes we were thankfully rescued by a Canadian Customs official who took us to the front of the crew line. We arrived again at YYC the next day three hours prior to our flight time cleared U.S. Customs in seven minutes with eight U.S. Customs agents working. We cleared YYC Airport Security in seven minutes operating four lines opening only selected bags or purses. We were at our gate a two hours prior to rollback. How can you expect American tourists to visit Calgary and Banff if they continue to be mistreated in this way? Assuming that all airlines provide expected passenger volume information to U.S. Customs and YYC Airport Security and that anyone is using this information to manage these services how does it take one hour and forty minutes to get from the terminal to the gate? If people are going to miss their flights why is a U.S. Customs official circulating through the hour-long line telling us that we are not going to miss our flights? Why is there no advice to passengers regarding the current expected time delay to arrive at their gate? (This could be easily achieved by having a time written on any (or every) boarding pass when entering from the terminal and then noted by the person receiving passengers at the metal detectors who could then provide this information back to the entrance of U.S. Customs who could write it on a white-board sign.) Canadian Customs already uses a similar method to measure wait time. I provide this information and these questions in the hope that I may one-day return to Calgary without fear of wasting another day of my life (and the cost of hotel and meals) as a prisoner of U.S. Customs and YYC Airport Security.,1,0
calgary-airport,Ravi Mene,United Kingdom,Used Calgary airport for our departure point from Canada. We were dropped off by coach at ground level took some working out to departure level. After that check in for BA was a breeze security smooth but disappointed with the departure lounge several eating outlets not much choice for shopping the lady in duty free shop put me off by asking if I was on a international flight or else should get moving I thought she was closing the shop left without spending any money. This is probably due to all domestic and international flights leaving from same departure area.,4,0
calgary-airport,Kevin McDougald,,"Calgary is one of the better airports around. Baggage delivery was prompt after arriving on domestic flight. On departure getting through security was a quick and painless experience. Passengers departing from the ""D"" concourse can avail themselves of the various airside restaurants and shops. Comfortable armchairs set up around the concourse are a pleasant alternative to typical uncomfortable departure lounge seating. Large quantities of natural light in the ""D"" concourse also nice to have.",4,0
calgary-airport,Harold Ritzer,,Flew Frankfurt-Calgary-Edmonton. Arrived in Calgary at 4pm. Customs took seconds and our bags arrived within minutes of deplaning. Connection staff were slow though. 2 staff using paper lists to find all connecting passengers. Air Canada concierge working there helped us get booked onto a new flight at 5 pm.. We had to speedwalk not run accross the airport and re- clear security. Directions were clear but the airport looked dated. Security at A gates was very slow as we had an hour total in calgary. Area for Commuter planes gate A8 was small but fine. After a quick walk out to the turboprop we were on the plane by 10 to 5 so from getting off one plane clearing customs rechecking our bags clearing security and getting on the next flight it was 50 minutes. Amazing.,4,0
calgary-airport,S Koenig,,When Air Canada informed us that our flight times had been changed leaving us under 90 minutes between the arrival of our flight from Houston and the departure of our flight to Vancouver I was nervous since we'd have to go through Immigration and Customs and get to our new flight but the airline assured me it was plenty of time. We passed through Immigration and Customs very quickly (I have a U.S. passport and my wife has a Brazilian passport and U.S. permanent residency card) and then walked briskly over the long distance to our departure gate. We made our flight with time to spare (not a lot of time mind you but enough to allow a quick trip to a rest room before boarding was announced). I can't comment on most of the airport's facilities but at least in our case transiting was fast and easy.,4,0
calgary-airport,T Lee,,I cannot agree with these comments. I am a British citizen living in the States and every time bar one that I have entered Canada at Calgary airport (via Chicago) at immigration I have been told to go to the separate office at the back behind immigration. There I have had to wait for ages before being questioned in detail about my purpose in visiting Canada. I have seen this happen to other visitors too. I am fortunate to have travelled all over the world in my life and I have not experienced this at any other airport ever. Next time I have to go to western Canada I will go another way perhaps via Toronto even if it takes longer.,1,0
calgary-airport,D Balinowski,,Nice building but it's a bit of a walk if you're connecting between Concourse A and D. Shopping plentiful outside the secure area and prices reasonable. Airport volunteers in cowboy hats add character to the place.,4,0
calgary-airport,Brian Hansen,,"Adequate building overall but about the ""Stetsoned Welcomer Wagon"" people: Rather than a nice touch it's like being cornered by some kind of cheerleading mascot. Some people's idea of fun perhaps. I also note the lack of a needed rail link here as even though it's a small city the traffic is an honest concern (throughout not just to the airport.) Air service is adequate for North America.",3,0
calgary-airport,Michael Henry,,After our negative experience at JFK Calgary airport was a wonderful breath of fresh air. It didn't take long to go through customs where the staff were friendly and approachable. The staff with our coach to Banff (2 hours away) were lovely and during our 40 min wait we had coffee and actually relaxed. Getting our luggage was quick too.,5,0
calgary-airport,R Clements,,"It is always a pleasure to fly into Calgary or Vancouver airports. The red waistcoated and stetsoned ""welcomers"" are a really nice touch and very helpful for information. Had a 7 hour lay over in Calgary. The airport is clean and shops are interesting. We spent a couple of hours having lunch in a proper - non food court - restaurant which helped time pass. We also like being able to store our luggage until it could be checked in at a reasonably modest charge. 7 hours lay over in an airport is never fun but if you have to do it it's a much better experience in Calgary than elsewhere.",5,0
calgary-airport,James Faulkner,,Flew in from JFK - small but clean and efficient. On the way out check in staff really nice no charge for overweight bag. Lots of glass so you have a view. At least some shops before customs. Customs Official very rude on way out but it was US customs so you expect that from them! Lady who checked my bags was nice though. Not much to do after customs except have a beer or a tea. Overall a pleasant experience.,,0
calgary-airport,Carl Cater,,"We were impressed by the cleanliness of the airport and the warmth of the welcome from a number of Calgary ""Ambassadors"" dressed in red uniforms with white cowboy-style hats. There was a very brief wait at Immigration Control and the official there welcomed us to Canada and wished us a great holiday! Baggage came through quickly (Premium Cabin luggage priority labelling obviously noted and dealt with!). Onward transport to the local Hotel was meant to be a courtesy coach but we were given a limo instead! One of the best Airports I have been to!",,0
calgary-airport,Sam Hawkins,,Calgary Airport has an excellent assortment of shops and services. I was there for 4 hours one morning because of a flight delay. The general public has access to a food fair airplane model store Virgin records Purdy's Chocolates to name a few. It definitely has more to offer than Vancouver or Alberta's provincial capital Edmonton's lousy airport. No wonder Calgary gets the bulk of Alberta's air traffic. I enjoyed the large windows to view arriving and departing aircraft. The FIDS screens are colourful and easy to understand.,,0
calgary-airport,Jon MacKenzie,,Having just transited at Calgary going from YEG to LHR I was taken somewhat aback by the barren wind-scorched terrain in Calgary. In stark contrast to the lovely forests snowy fields and overwhelming pleasantness of Edmonton Calgary looked dead brown and broken up only by the uninspired warehouses typical of industrial airports. This isn't to say it was a bad terminal quite the opposite it's assuredly as uncrowded and efficient as everyone has said but on the airside it truly is boring the staff seemed plastic and the view was simply painful. While from the moment I touched down in Vancouver I had been spellbound by Canada Calgary was a truly unexpected sendoff from an otherwise gorgeous nation.,,0
calgary-airport,Shawn Johnson,,Although Calgary’s airport is not nearly at the level of Canada's gateway international airports of Toronto and Vancouver. They have a very nice small airport on the Canadian prairies. The best thing about YYC is it has light traffic so if you have to make a connection at YYC getting to your gate is quick and easy - no mobs of people like the big city airports and you don't have to take a train/bus to get to your gate or terminal.,,0
calgary-airport,Bob McInnis,,The airport has become a destination for travellers visitors and locals. Renovations are not quite (if ever) complete but this is one of the best designed facilities in North America. Great selection of shopping on both sides of security in all terminals (ABCD) with hours slightly reduced as late night/early morning traffic dictates. YYC is run as a business and is attracting non flying public with cheap evening parking attractions and restaurants.,,0
calgary-airport,K McKinnon,,YYC is a great airport having just at the end of renovation the airport is clean modern and classy. Concourse A B and C are slightly older but still are better than what you would find in Toronto or Vancouver. Lots of shops lots of food courts and there are tons of comfortable seats.,,0
calgary-airport,D Schlösser,,Found YYC to be a pleasant place to transit from an Air Canada Jazz flight from YQU to the intercontinental Air Canada service to Frankfurt. There are some big comfy leather seats in the departure lounge to relax and to have a look out on the apron. Mostly short ways only if you have to connect between A and B you have to start walking some 5 to 10 minutes before bording. Only downside is the lack of restaurants ( only two Tim Hortons and a bar) after security where you normally are while just on transit. I liked this airport and will use it again in summer to connect. Air Canada Maple leaf lounge is a pleasant place to stay while you wait with all the services you need and expect.,,0
calgary-airport,Li Ping Tan,,Beautiful airport post renovation much of the Canadian departure areas have been upgraded and atriums/walkways are spacious and bright. Many new shops and exhibits. security and other ground staff are friendly as always. However what still needs to be updated are their US departure lounges. Cramped dark boring. But overall a league above most N.American airports.,,0
calgary-airport,G Eto,,It has far more services than many other larger airports and yet due to its medium-size does not suffer from overcrowding. Nice features include a stunning central lounge atrium with water fountains and a huge glass facade with amazing views of the city and airplanes spa post-office free baggage carts hotel within the terminal complex with calming atrium portable DVD player/movie rental multiple restaurants great selection of stores aviation/space exhibit for the kids and plenty of free outlets to plug your laptop in. I much prefer to use a well-serviced medium-sized airport like Calgary than the big hubs.,,0
calgary-airport,Darrell Taylor,,Calgary doesn't have the size benefits of Vancouver or Toronto but then it doesn't suffer the opposite of being too busy. The immigration staff at Canada customs are a breath of fresh air compared to US airports (and NZ) we've never had to wait more than 10 minutes in line (and they have also learned to smile!). Now the refurbishment is nearly complete the access and services are greatly improved we still enjoy travelling through there.,,0
calgary-airport,Kevin Leung,,YYC is a above average airport. The terminal itself is under renovation. The Westjet terminal is great with some dinosaurs exhibits on the roof. The only problem is during the peak hours for Westjet departure the waiting area can be very crowd and not enough seats for everyone to sit comfortably. Also the departure hall check-in desks in area A B & C are all poorly design and passengers are not easy to access to their check-in desk whatever which airline. The design also affect the efficiency of passenger's movement. But generally speaking YYC is a good place to go through with enough shopping and dining when consider YYC is not a popular transfer airport. People just stay in the airport for a short while an extensive shopping and dining facilities are not really necessary.,,0
calgary-airport,M Devor,,Good airport but will agree with the others everything is landside and the airside is quite boring. Air Canada closed the only lounge in the US departures section in April so no lounge this time. The airport is under renovation so I will give them some credit. The lines for US customs were too long. They open the US customs hall at certain times of the day before a bank of flights and everyone stands there waiting. Otherwise great airport good shopping and very friendly staff. I am sure when the construction is over it will be magnificent.,,0
calgary-airport,Andrew Graupe,,Calgary isn't the biggest but is my favorite airport. Terminals are nicely laid out passenger drop-off is easy and yes those Smarte-Cartes have yet to invade meaning that you can get a baggage cart FREE! Check-in works well and the first-class lounge is very nice. Customs clearance is easy coming to and from the United States and there are many food service venues.,,0
calgary-airport,Li Ping Tan,,The US departures section is poorly designed and looks ancient! The whole airport seems designed for the people who send off travellers - once you head through the gates there is absolutely nothing to do! Having said that it IS undergoing renovation so hopefully it'll only get better.,,0
canberra-airport,Richard Buckley,United Kingdom,Just a breeze to navigate. Spacious clean low stress. Good views of runway and stands. Limited shopping/food options. Security not highly automated (a lot of manual pushing and shoving of trays).,9,1
canberra-airport,Alastair Finch,United Kingdom,Very large airport for flights it handles check in easy airside facilities rather limited for a brand new terminal.,8,1
canberra-airport,D Olsson,Australia,My word the new terminal has capacity that won't be needed in Canberra for 50 years! And I think I saw a sign predicting another new terminal on the DFO side that would just be ridiculous. So it's great for passengers at the moment - huge amount of space short queues for everything lots of road access and parking great views of the runway good lounges. Perhaps the increase in size has made it less clear where to go for things like taxis and hire cars and I don't think they've finished all the signage yet.,9,1
canberra-airport,Roger Stone,Australia,Compared to the poor and cramped small terminal that used to be here the newly built terminal has fresh and airy conditions and quite good facilities. However an annoying issue is that now Canberra Airport's Terminal managers have decided to play terribly loud music through the main buildings. Why on earth this decision has been made is beyond me - it certainly doesn't fit the style of the average passenger passing through this terminal. Indeed its enough to make me try avoid this terminal and make a point of not buying anything from the commercial outlets. Otherwise drop-off and check-in facilities are good security is efficient and air-bridges and staff appear mostly efficient.,7,0
canberra-airport,Ian Morris,Australia,The new terminal is a revelation compared to the old cramped terminal. Bright and airy easy check-in excellent club lounges bright gate waiting areas easy boarding this is the way an airport should be. Only hassle at the moment is the location of the taxi stand but once the whole airport redevelopment is finished this will not be a problem.,9,1
canberra-airport,Y Ren,Australia,The New Canberra airport is much improved on the old one. The nation's capital finally has a decent airport. Easy check-in area good airline lounges easy boarding process. very impressed.,4,0
canberra-airport,A Ravi,,Landed in Canberra from Melbourne on Qantas and taxied in to the new Canberra Airport Terminal. I was told only departure lounges for Virgin Blue and Tiger airways were still in use in the old terminal however all airlines had check-in and baggage claims in the new terminal. A magnificent improvement from the glass aerobridges to the large glass panes that covered the walls of the terminal. Larger Shops as well as a conveniently located coffee shop were also noted. There was a much larger seating capacity than previously. On the exterior the terminal was extremely fancy and had newly implemented elevated roads to the departures level. All in all a superb terminal with fancy design extravagant interiors and modern facilities.,4,0
canberra-airport,Chris McQuaid,,"Day return from Sydney - only had hand luggage so straight off plane (airbridge) and into terminal. Bus fare seemed reasonable ($9 one way $15 return) but I wasn't aware until told by a policeman in the terminal that it was a public holiday so bus service to town was infrequent. He told me where to find the bus stop (easy enough) but there was no timetable! I got a taxi instead. Departure was rather more troublesome - I had checked in for both flights in Sydney so didn't need the check-in facilities at CBR but finding a seat that was out of the quite fierce sun was rather difficult. Food prices were also high ($6.50 for two sandwiches $3.50 for a small bottle of soft drink). Then when I went through the scanner for security everything I was wearing set it off! I had to take off my belt then my shoes but it still beeped because I have metal pins in my feet. When I asked why I had not had any similar problem at SYD I was told ""our scanner is more sensitive!"" Way too sensitive is more like it. No airbridge this time - just a very short walk to the plane. It seems a nice enough airport but I have to deduct points for no bus timetable security and the over-priced food.",2,0
canberra-airport,P Major,,Checked in for my Qantas flight with Quickcheck which was very efficient. Then a short trip to the bag drop counter and we were on our way up the escalators to the gate lounge. Hardly anyone around and we were surprised that there weren't any kiosks or cafes to grab something at. However there was plenty of seating. I'm told that the Virgin area has a bit more activity as well as a cafe or two. You'd hope this little airport doesn't become a MEL or a SYD anytime soon.,,0
canberra-airport,A Kattula,,Flew into Canberra on Virgin at 8.40am on a wet Friday morning 25/8. Virgin uses common user area and was only flight there. Bags off very quickly as lightly loaded flight and majority of passengers only had hand luggage. Rental car desks easy to locate and terminal well sign posted . About a 200m walk to rental car area mainly under cover. Arrival was all in all quick and efficient. Noted signs and announcements for bus service to city centre $7 one way or $12 return with service every half hour is quite good. Departure again very easy as not many Virgin flights in and out of Canberra. Warning - Check gate number carefully as Qantas use seperate departure area from others and they are not connected! Why they dont connect them is beyond me as it would save money by not having to double up on security staff and shop staff! Bar/snack counter in Common user area doesn't open until one hour before flight so if you are early stay landside if you want to eat or drink!. Terminal clean and bright with good view of apron area. Canberra is an efficient airport coping well with its current number of pasengers.,,0
canberra-airport,Edmund Carew,,Unlike the DJ terminal in SYD CBR with its renovations is well light including plenty of natural light. Cleaners do an excellent job: SYD and to a lesser extent MEL and BNE take note! The coach service to the city remains inadequate: only an hourly frequency at most times on weekdays and no services on weekends and no pickups en route from 'Civic' (city) at places like offices in the suburb of Russell for instance. The urban otherwise excellent ACTION bus network should ideally serve the airport even if private operator Deanes presumably have the historic traffic rights.,,0
canberra-airport,Ben Gertz,,I recently went through CBR on a Holiday to Canberra It is a nice Airport and terminal better than my home City Townsville but it looks to be revamped a little maybe replace the Aerobridges and Check-Inns Townsville even has newer Qantas Check-Inns and modern Aerobridges don't know about the Virgin Blue side though.,,0
canberra-airport,Paddy Ward,,Yes the international flights started up a month ago you can now fly from CBR to NAN (I think that's right for Nadi) twice a week (Thursday and Sunday) at 1.30 pm. It's all very well set up like a production one minute they've got the customs set up and quarantine etc etc and half an hour later it's all gone again. You'd never know it was an international airport for one hour.,,0
canberra-airport,Paddy Ward,,Went through CBR to fly to Melbourne for the Easter weekend. QF check-in staff member was very hospitable and I checked in with no fuss. Security staff friendly and I hope CBR stays this way. To be honest I wouldn't really want it to become another MEL or SYD or BNE.,,0
canberra-airport,T Richard,,Had the pleasure of visiting Canberra recently and I found the airport quite pleasant. The staff were also friendly and very helpful. I read in a local paper about plans to introduce international flights which I think is a great idea.,,0
canberra-airport,Craig Wilkes,,Canberra is my home airport and I generally agree with Paddy Ward that it is a nice airport. I have also found the staff to be friendly and accommodating. The Qantas check-in staff always try to get you a good seat for the international connections out of Sydney or Melbourne. The facilities are quite good with separate gate areas for Qantas and Virgin Blue/Regional Express. My only gripe is the stupid policy that only allows you to drop-off near the terminal but not pick up passengers and their luggage even if they are waiting at the kerb. This is supposedly for 'security reasons' but why then do they allow drop-offs. I believe that it's so the airport operators can rip you off for parking which has a minimum charge of $1 even if you stay for only one minute.,,0
canberra-airport,Paddy Ward,,Although it isn't actually an international airport Canberra is a pleasure to pass through. Staff are friendly services are plentiful and it has good vibes about it. I invite others to share their experiences about Canberra airport.,,0
cancun-airport,M Reynolds,United States,I flew down mid week on Wednesday arriving around 2 pm. Sat on plane for 30 minutes on taxi-way waiting for a parking space. Then utter chaos. No restrooms. No air conditioning. People crammed in a space that was totally disorganized. It took 3 hours from exiting the plane to walking out the door of the airport. Utter chaos. I've never seen anything like it. I will never return.,,0
cancun-airport,M Ralph,Canada,"Cancun airport arrivals is absolutely horrible! I have been through this airport dozens of times over two decades and nothing has changed! Plan to be processed for at least three hours. The problem here has consistently been complete and utter lack or organization and not enough staff and officials to process people. On top of that they just don't care. The airport authority doesn't care and that filters down to all the staff and immigration guards. I am not an airport official but I am an efficiency expert in my field of work. I would love to have a week in this airport and overhaul all of their processes! New cash grab! Smokers do not bring more than one carton of your homeland cigarettes through this airport! They will fine you 500% of the value of one carton for the excess. They consider it ""foreign merchandise"" and it will be taxed. I watched dozens of people utterly flabbergasted by this new tax grab. Be prepared to have all of your bags and luggage rescanned and searched. The trouble with these officials is they don't get the difference between what is coming into the country and what is being taken out. The exit process from Mexico is far easier and less time consuming! Like everything else in this country the Mexicans try to do things like the rest of the world but they don't quite hit the mark! Be prepared to have tons of your time wasted unnecessarily!",,0
cancun-airport,J Sanders,United States,Arrived on a Tuesday in April around 11am local time. Sailed through immigration baggage pick-up and customs. Only hold up was filling out the forms since AA did not give us them on the airplane. From airplane to meeting our ride was 20 minutes. Departed on Saturday at 2.30om. Arrived at noon and almost did not have enough time. Waited to use the kiosk to check in. Waited almost 1.5 hours to drop bags off. Waited again for security. Airport was a complete zoo with nowhere to sit. Crowds everywhere and organization was lacking. Sound level in Terminal 3 was almost deafening. My ears ached by the time I got on the plane. Don't leave on Saturday afternoon if you want this experience at the end of your vacation!,2,0
cancun-airport,P James,United Kingdom,It took us 3.5 hours to get through passport control. There must have been three or four planes landing within the space of a half an hour. The place was an absolute cattle market no air conditioning a sea of hot sweaty miserable people. The Customs staff appeared under manned or just couldn't care less. Although We loved the holiday I'm afraid we will never go back to Mexico or at least the Cancun area until this sorry excuse for an airport is either upgraded or redesigned it's not as if they don't have the passenger throughput!,,0
cancun-airport,Boris Berry,Canada,Quite simply the worst airport experience I have had. Two hours two get through passport control. An absolute sea of frustrated hot and irritable passengers let alone tired screaming babies. Absolutely no sense of urgency from the few staff who were on duty and an overall feeling that was akin to a cattle market. Will never visit this place again!,,0
cancun-airport,Steve Garrett,United Kingdom,My second time through this airport and nothing has changed for the better. Simply put the airport is not fit for purpose and the passenger experience is stressful and problematic when arriving. It is an absolute cattle market when trying to get through immigration baggage reclaim and then the awful customs (green light red light). Too many aircraft arriving together with too many passengers seeking to get out through facilities that cannot cope.,,0
cancun-airport,Max Bellum,Canada,Travelled in Dec 2014. Hadn't been back here for a while so was surprised by the changes. Has to be the first airport that I have seen built inside a shopping mall. Even the boarding gates are hidden between stores. There are stores everywhere. What a zoo when its busy arriving or departing. Don't buy food inside the airport. Prices are ridiculous $23 USD for a single hamburger and fries. Can we all say Rip-off! Think I won't be back for a long while.,2,0
cancun-airport,J Tung,United Kingdom,Used terminal 3 in November. Fairly modern terminal but with very limited facilities. The departure experience was far better than arrival. The departure hall was modern and clean and queue to check in or bag drop was not too long. Security check took a while but that seems to be the norm nowadays. There was a decent duty free and some shops after security. Nothing too interesting. Also few restaurants near the duty free. I visited the lounge which was poor - very limited drink and food and the seating area is dated. Arrival experience on the other hand was bad. Immigration was efficient but the luggage wait was long. I waited at least an hour to reclaim my luggage. After the luggage claim everyone has to go through the customs - the queuing system is bad and again the facilities not able to cope which results in another hour of waiting. And the entire arrival hall was chaotic.,3,0
cancun-airport,Garry L Price,Canada,"Flew into Cancun on Monday 1 September 2014 arriving at 11.40am. Customs hall was empty and breezed through bags were actually waiting for us in the baggage room and then onto the ""dreaded"" baggage scan pressed the button it turned green. From stepping off the plane to meeting our rep must have taken all of 20 mins. Departed 11 September 2014 at 10 am check in at the AC counter was quick as was security check. There is adequate shops etc in the departures lounge.",8,1
cancun-airport,Ivonne Alva,United States,"I visit this airport at least once a year at times twice for the last 12 years. Very clean! Bathrooms are perfect! I have never been in that airport more than an hour fast and courteous staff. Only one time there was a long delay due to the computer systems being down that time we were stuck in the airport almost 3 hours. My only complaint is that at departure they have put self check-in kiosks and then they make you stand in line for 45 minutes to drop your bags off (AA specifically) - I wonder why they don't have a designated ""baggage drop-off"" counter?",8,1
cancun-airport,Steve Garrett,United Kingdom,We landed on time from Manchester and was then forced to wait just over an hour in the aircraft on the taxiway because there was nowhere to park the plane. When eventually we did get landside a queue like never seen trying to get through immigration. The baggage reclaim had 3 flights on the one belt and then another very long queue to get through customs after of course having all bags scanned. Not good enough for an International Airport. Three hours from landing to leaving the airport (16.04.14).,,0
cancun-airport,Dana Bain,United States,I have been traveling to this airport for over 20 years and they have made significant improvements that translate to shorter wait times. I have never seen them screen every bag there must have been a specific reason for that. The best advice I offer is do not travel on Saturday. That is by far the busiest day with the longest wait times due to timeshare owners.,8,1
cancun-airport,M Bastos,Canada,I was there in Jan and our flight arrived late night. The line at security check took us about 20 minutes and staff were very polite plus about 20 minutes to reclaim baggage. The facilities are clean but seem old. Outside there are a lot of tourism agents staff and people offering services. It was easy to find the tourism agency staff and took the bus to the resort. When I came back home my flight was delayed. I arrived to the airport a long time before check in and the airline booth was not settled but the electronic monitor was displaying were it should be. There is no seats available in the check in area. I found seats in the arrival area or we could go to restaurant and snack places. When time to check in came there was a long line. Don't forget to have the Mexican entry form with you to avoid delays at the check in. Staff were efficient and the security screen was smooth. After you pass security the airport is much bigger than it seems and is busy. At least the area we were domestic and International flights were departing frequently. Boarding areas had plenty of seats and there was a lot of places for food. However prices are very high. Restroom at the boarding area and general facilities are clean and big enough to handle its traffic. I found the announcements in English very difficult to understand due to low sound pronunciation and noise. However there was no problem talking in English on the information centre or with airline staff. 10 minutes before boarding the flight showed up on the gate monitor and after that we had 1.40 hr delay until boarding with no explanation. The airport seems to handle well traffic on a normal season but it may be overwhelming during high peak.,7,1
cancun-airport,John Traynor,United Kingdom,Took nearly 90 minutes to get through immigration and as we were leaving were collared by official looking people with desks in the building trying to get deposits off us for free excursions. On leaving we had to pay £50 each (1800 pesos in total) and then found very expensive food and drink in the departure restaurants.,2,0
cancun-airport,J Henson,United Kingdom,Arrival was on 5 March 2013. Having arrived on a half full British Airways flight from London we were off the aircraft and through immigration within 20 minutes of landing. There was only a small immigration queue and passengers appeared to be processed relatively quickly and the immigration official was pleasant. Short wait for bags to arrive and we were through customs in less than 5 minutes - again the customs official was polite welcoming and helpful despite requesting an additional baggage search of the person that I was travelling with. My main criticism was after leaving the terminal building it was unclear where to go for onward connections using public transport. On the return journey the airport was extremely busy - long queue for check-in although the check-in agent and BA's ground handling team generally were pleasant and helpful. We were very grateful for a short and efficient security process. No BA lounge so used the TGI Fridays which again was very busy but decent food at an ok price as we had complementary BA vouchers. Decent range of shops and managed to find a postbox for my postcards despite being told by several airport employees that there was not one in the terminal. Boarding was crazy but thankfully I was entitled to use the priority line. My recommendation to avoid stress would be to arrive at least 2 hours before you are due to travel as long queues appear to be the norm at this airport.,7,1
cancun-airport,J Clark,United States,We were prepared for waiting as it was Christmas week. It took us about 40 minutes to clear immigration which was fine. However when we reached the baggage claim it was pandemonium. The entire room was full and lines snaked everywhere. They were actually using X-Ray machines to screen every bag leaving the terminal. I have traveled extensively world-wide and know of no country that is doing this including the U.S. What could Mexican Authorities possibly think tourists are smuggling into Cancun on already screened Aircraft? It took us 1.5hrs to exit the Baggage area and from what we heard we were lucky. There was more danger created by the shear amount of people crammed into that baggage room than there ever could have been by failing to X-Ray bags leaving the Airport.,1,0
cancun-airport,Mike Sayers,United Kingdom,Immigration hell. Took us 2 hours 30 minutes to get through and others longer. Friends arrived two days before us and they had same experience so not a one off. Worst I have ever experienced in 35 years of travel.,,0
cancun-airport,Bobby Giannakopoulos,Canada,Landed at CUN airport from a flight coming from Montreal. There was at least 30 minutes of waiting to pass passport control probably because there were many flights landing at the same time mostly coming from the USA but my bags were already out. Check-in and to clear security went smoothly. The terminal was not very big but it's pretty busy. Overall Cancun airport is not too bad and it has a couple of shops and restaurants.,7,1
cancun-airport,A Cruickshank,United Kingdom,Just returned this morning Cancun to Glasgow. Check-in at Cancun was shambolic as we had to join a queue leading to two premium seating check-in desks displaying on the monitor check in for Manchester and Glasgow. When we eventually got to a desk it was just a shambles the PHS handling staff member labelled our suitcases then for some reason lifted them off the conveyor and then just by chance after we arrived at the departure lounge we noticed that we had been allocated economy seating at the rear of the aircraft. After contacting a female member of PHS staff she managed to get our seating changed to Premium. Needless to say our two suitcases never arrived in Glasgow. So be aware if you visit Cancun.,6,1
cancun-airport,V Henderson,Canada,Very nice well organized airport has improved greatly over the three times we have visited the area. However - do not purchase food or gifts at the shops. Lunch for 2 adults and 2 children $123. Purchased a few gifts once we got home noticed the suggested retail prices was whited out and we were charged double what it should have been. Very disappointing and has contributed to our decision not to return to the area.,2,0
cancun-airport,Masaki Oda,Japan,"I use this airport several times a year. Though the name says ""International"" it is an ordinary US regional airport. The airport is served by feeder commuter flights for majors plus some mainline flights. A small restaurant and a few shops are at the terminal. The terminal is well kept and is connected to a parking building so that you do not have to go out during the cold winter. The free WiFi is available. I would like to mention that TSA personnel's at this airport are professionals and have never been unpleasant.",5,0
cancun-airport,C O'Neill,,Cancun Airport This was a bright clean and friendly airport with a good range of shops and cafes. The staff were friendly and helpful. I flew in to Mexico via a different airport so my experience of Cancun is based on departures only.,4,0
cancun-airport,Linda Lehnert,,This airport is new and is fairly easy to navigate. Parking in front of the terminal is excellent. I flew into CUN and had to stop at the agricultural inspection station because I had 4 cats. The agricultural inspector was very nice and my paperwork was in order but under current law each passenger is allowed only 2 cats so Aduana wouldn't let me take all of my cats out with me until necessary paperwork was completed. Overall the airport is excellent for facilities.,4,0
cancun-airport,C Collins,,My husband and I departed the Cancun airport for Chicago just after the Christmas Day terror attempt resulting in increased security. We were prepared for the security delays and allowed time to pass through. The airport experience was uneventful. I have a titanium knee replacement and always get stopped at security! It's expected and never intimidating. However: During this time of heightened security I passed right through the scanners. Either the screeners didn't question what they saw or they missed it. It could have been a weapon! I am now concerned that I didn't mention this at the gate but I didn't . Just hoping that the airport officials read these comments.,4,0
cancun-airport,Jacqueline Cor by,,Very impressed. Compared to Dubai airport (supposedly one of the best) it was excellent. Good places to eat and nice shops. Exceptionally clean toilets.,5,0
cancun-airport,M Keenan,,"Third world airport is a scary sounding phrase but Cancun airport doesn't deserve the scary reputation that this suggests. In several trips through Cancun in the past three years I have never had a problem. On arrival transiting through immigration was reasonably fast and checked baggage always turned up quickly. Sometimes (if your 'number comes up') Mexican customs makes a more thorough search of your baggage (including x-raying) but even this wasn't too much of a problem. On departure I’ve found that the airport processes people quickly and that security line-ups are minimal. There is plenty of comfortable seating in the departure area and many options for the shopper or traveller with time on their hands (including one of those typical Mexican pharmacies that sell just about any kind of drug without requiring a prescription). I only have two issues with Cancun: Firstly the number of time share hawkers waiting to pounce on you right after you exit customs some masquerading as representatives of the tour companies. Just ignore them and keep walking. The other issue is temporary – Cancun is building a new runway and the road network is a little messed up while construction is in progress making it slow driving in and out. In summary Cancun airport is easier to arrive at and depart from than a number of ""First world airports"" that I’ve travelled through in recent times and they should be complimented for doing a good job.",,0
cancun-airport,Stephanie Brown,,It's really a tale of two airports. The immigration and arrivals areas are bad. I arrived 3.5 hours ahead of the party I was meeting in Cancun. I went through immigration and started over to baggage claim. The people on my flight and I waited more than 30 minutes for our luggage. After that the challenge is dodging the timeshare hawkers. Right when you walk into the rental car area there is an area of bank teller like booths staffed with people who wave you over urgently as soon as you make eye contact. It seems official but don't fall for it. If you dont get stuck with that then there are people standing around who pretend they are going to help you to your rental car or to the transportation to your hotel but it always ends up turning into a timeshare commercial. Also there is no place to sit so if you have to wait for any amount of time you have to sit on the floor. I would suggest when arriving leave straight away from the airport and dont make eye contact with anyone! Just plow through to the exit. The departure area is much nicer. Pretty clean lots of shops and stuff. I was amazed at how decent it was. No problems with the departure process. Planes are slow to board. Security goes through every carry on bag as you board the plane. The beauty of Cancun far outweighs the bad stuff at the airport. Just get out of there as soon as you can and enjoy the paradise that awaits,,0
cancun-airport,David Chown,,Very pleasantly surprised leaving from Cancun. Bright clean and large modern airport. Check-in for XL Airways was quick and efficient no delays at security ample seating in area with shops and food outlets. At 11 pm currency exchange was still open.,,0
cancun-airport,Bob Faulkner,,"I suppose that I expected a bit more from an airport serving a major tourist area. First there is only one runway (which was closed for 20 minutes due to debris as we approached from Denver) and many of the gates have no jetways. When we departed we had to board a bus with no seats to be hauled to the far end of the tarmac to board our flight from portable steps. When you arrive you are besieged by people wanting to give you a ""welcome package"" - invariably people hawking time shares. If you have never been to Cancun before you have no idea that they are not affiliated with the company you booked your tours through. Very chaotic getting to ground transportation. This airport is decidedly third world which I found surprising.",,0
cancun-airport,G Hamilton,,Cancun Airport has undergone a great deal of improvement in the last year. Baggage reclaim was pleasantly quick and the immigration side is bigger and more efficient than previous years. They have X-ray machines now instead of opening everybodys case now but they still select many at random for close inspection which can delay you. The departure checkin desks appear on screen 3 hours before the flight but there was an hour queuing before the desk actually opened . The departure lounge in the international terminal has been vastly improved with a snack food court bar and a new duty free shopping area which passed the time quite nicely. All in all quite a good experience and much more efficient. There was no baggage search to delay checkin on departure this year but they still have a departure tax of $50 USD at check in !,,0
cancun-airport,P Cross,,Very impressed with the layout services cleanliness and comfort of the Cancun airport - well done. It certainly makes for an even better vacation experience.,,0
cancun-airport,Christian Rocha,,I have arrived and departed via Terminal 2 (domestic flights) several times and it has been a decent experience. In fact CUN was making some progress previous to the Hurricane Wilma incident. The location of the airport is quite far away from Cancun but its in the center of the Maya Riviera complex. True many improvements can be made (especially when it comes to entertainment and ventilation) but it fares quite well compared to other Mexican airports. Transportation wise there are some problems but it fares better than Honolulu or San Diego.,,0
cancun-airport,Y Oh,,"Cancun airport was very unpleasant experience. There were signs everywhere that said ""NO SMOKING"" but everyone was smoking. If you can't stand the smoke this airport will be a terrible place. There is no enforcement to prevent people from smoking. In addition ventilation in the airport is pretty bad which doesn't help this situation. I even asked the security guard about this and she just told me ""I am sorry"".",,0
cancun-airport,Steve Hedden,,Cancun airport is OK. I arrived and departed through Terminal 1 which is the older terminal. Customs and Immigration on arrival was orderly and straight-forward. Departures were well-labeled and frequently announced. Transport from the airport to Cancun is frustrating as you are guided to the $60 taxis. There is no signage or other directions to the $1.50 shuttle that departs every half hour. (I learned about this only for my return) The trick is that the shuttle only departs from Terminal 2 so from Terminal 1 you must first take the inter-terminal shuttle. Also annoying was the chronic smoking in the terminal even at the gates despite 'No Smoking' signs posted everywhere.,,0
cancun-airport,Norman Beattie,,Cancun airport is really operated quite efficiently not that improvements cant be made. I have been in and out of this airport for 15 years and have experienced it all. Everything is a matter of perspective Mexico is Mexico some things are to be expected and prepared for.,,0
cancun-airport,Jose Balrrada,,Cancun Airport has always provided exceptional service and a great experience. Terminal 1 is a bit old and always crowded but since I'm mexican I almost always arrive and depart from Terminal 2 which is a newer bigger and more modern terminal with a big round concourse comprising around 20 gates. The new baggage claim area is a total disaster they send 4 flights to the same conveyor just like in Mexico City even when there are many carousels left. Conveyors 15-18 are never used instead they exploit 1-10 and sometimes use 11-15. Organization is a big problem but its even a great and big international airport.,,0
cancun-airport,David Stein,,I flew into Cancun once from Charlotte. Customs and immigration were chaotic. Lines were formed all over. It took 2 hours to clear passport control. Check in was no problem at all.,,0
cancun-airport,Martin Davidson,,Based on my last four visits to Cancun I would have to agree with the negative comments posted her by others. The exception - on 8th October 2004 I left Cancun for London Gatwick and everything went smoothly and quickly! We arrived at the airport about 90 minutes before our scheduled departure (charter Britannia BY362B 15:35 departure) and there was no queue at all - we walked straight up to the desk without our luggage having to undergo a manual search where we were checked-in quickly and we paid our departure tax there (none of the separate queuing as reported by Nick Williamson). The straight through to the departure lounge where we made some duty-free purchases and had a drink and then boarded the flight on time and departure was also on time. I guess that sometimes things work very well even in Cancun!,,0
cape-town-airport,Steve Davidson,United Kingdom,A wonderful airport to travel through except for the ridiculous amount of customs desks on the green lane when coming in from overseas. Are these people for real? Have they been given instructions to chase overseas visitors away? Surely South Africa needs as many tourists as possible? This is going to put the word out that they should avoid it for sure. I've had a couple of trips to Cape Town since Christmas and been stopped both times with no contraband carried. British readers would recognise them as 'Jobsworths' who need to tick boxes to keep their jobs. Very irritating and very intimidating.,9,1
cape-town-airport,B Stauffer,Switzerland,Cape Town Airport was voted the best airport in Africa and it is easy to see why: it is fairly new very clean and very efficient. Employees are very friendly and the toilets spotless. The security is top notch and very efficient and fast (American airports could learn a lot here). The only down side is the arrival level: whoever designed it must have been drunk because when you arrive you have to walk to the far-end of the building collect your luggage and walk all the way back (can be as far as 800m)!,10,1
cape-town-airport,T Boucher,United Kingdom,Security checks were lacking at Cape Town airport and did not come anywhere near the high levels experienced at other airports throughout the world. We took a flight on 3rd March 2014 to London. We were not asked to declare any liquids not asked to empty pockets or remove belts jewellery shoes coats or anything. Needless to say the scanner alarm sounded when we both passed through the arch due to the various metal items in pockets or on our persons. We were then very briefly 'patted down' as was every other passenger. I would be very uneasy about taking flights from Cape Town until they tighten up significantly on their security procedures.,2,0
cape-town-airport,D James,South Africa,Economy check in for a mid afternoon international flight was very disorganized and unsettling. Large numbers of people milling around aimlessly with no defined queue for check in. Lots of people were accompanying a single passenger to the check in counter and airline staff thin on the ground. It was unexpected of an otherwise really spacious and very beautiful airport.,8,1
cape-town-airport,M Koeleman,South Africa,Brilliant and efficient. No wonder this is the best airport in Africa. World-class facilities brilliant lounges and seems to handle passenger numbers easily (it was completely rebuilt for the 2010 World Cup). Centralised departure terminal on top floor with restaurants on mezzanine level. All arrivals on ground floor. Compact and easy to navigate. Lots of parking and connections to city (public bus / taxi etc) right outside the central terminal. After seeing my share of global airports I am proud to call this airport home.,9,1
cape-town-airport,D Olsson,Australia,Good for a small airport. International arrival was fine except for insufficient immigration staff. Domestic departure also fine: fast check-in and security spacious terminal and decent shops. Might not be able to handle an increase in passengers though.,9,1
cape-town-airport,S Martin,United Kingdom,This is a very clean modern airport and easily navigated. The only thing I would say that is negative is the lack of food outlets in the departure lounge.,9,1
cape-town-airport,C Wajsberg,Israel,Airport has totally been changed for past fifa world cup football. Airport can compete with any modern airport. Access is easy service fast and professional. Airport is clean and everything is widely available. Waiting area gives you a panoramic view of planes landing and taking off while waiting for your flight. Bars and restaurant are not cheap but cheaper then most other international airports.,9,1

ID check before easy boarding.,10,1
cape-town-airport,J Scheier,Germany,"CPT fully deserves the Skytrax rating ""Best airport in Africa"" - terminal building appears modern bright clean and friendly no long distance from VAT refund to baggage wrapping to check-in. I used the smaller international section where only merely 15 flights depart every day so no queues at security no queues at immigration no full lounges. Flew Turkish Airlines they use the Bidvest Lounge very friendly staff there choice and variety of their food could be better though. What a positive difference compared to busy Johannesburg.",9,1
cape-town-airport,R Mortara,United Kingdom,A spacious and well lit airport (lots of glass allowing natural light in). Processing time on arrival rather slow (around 50 mins) so luggage had already been delivered by the time I'd exited the customs area. Check-in on departure quickly completed. All staff I encountered including those at the security checks were efficient and friendly. Sufficient shops to pass time away without them appearing to me too many. A very pleasant airport all 'round.,9,1
cape-town-airport,D Leston,United Kingdom,Really nice airport - clean and new with speedy transit both inbound and outbound. Only one issue - the cafe/restaurant in international departures woefully slow with disinterested staff.,8,1
cape-town-airport,V Abraham,South Africa,CPT made my trip a complete pleasure! Getting to the airport was fast The CTB was clean modern had a very calm environment with lots of natural light.

cape-town-airport,Jon Ralph,South Africa,"Arrived from KL and waited for my wheelchair to be brought to aircraft. Was told that baggage handling staff had ignored label attached and slung it onto the carousel. Waited until airport provided another chair pushed by helpful young lady whose name I have forgotten. Immigration hall appeared unmanned when we got there but we spotted a manned desk. Upon approaching we noticed that the adjacent desk was occupied by a large lady who was catching up on her sleep shaking the rafters with her snores. The surly attandant stamped our passports without a word. No ""welcome"" or anything like that - merely an attitude of ""how dare you make me work"". Retrieved my chair and trundled outside to find our son who was supposed to pick us up was not there. Upon phoning him we discovered he had been directed by ACSA staff to the domestic arrivals despite his explanation he was picking up from an international flight. No private vehicle access is available and it took the efforts of the cheerful lady to allow him through. This is the poorest service I have received at any airport having come through KL Hanoi Bangkok Phuket and Singapore airports where everything ran like clockwork compared to our fiasco.",2,0
cape-town-airport,S Claassen,South Africa,Check in quick and easy security scanning quick and efficient and immigration a breeze. Other than that a wonderful revamped airport!,5,0
cape-town-airport,Peter Paxton,United Kingdom,What a difference here. From a small uncomfortable airport in the mid nineties to a modern large facility matching many European airports. Excellent check in and immigration checks much faster than before. The shrink wrapping machine for luggage (recommend that you use it) takes a bit of finding now and is not signposted. Good experience.,4,0
cape-town-airport,Allan Robins,United Kingdom,Absolutely fantastic airport a great improvement on the previous International & Domestic terminals which were in turn the best airports in Southern Africa. This really shows Joburg Airport how it should be done.

cape-town-airport,Mark Cowell,,Cape Town International Terminal. Check-in at SAA swift with absolutely no queues. Security and passport control both efficient and friendly. Large and airey terminal space affords a pleasant environment. Only slight draw back is buses remain part of the course at CPT which is OK if your going on a RJ (one bus) but seems to take for ever if its a large airliner. Hoping the new terminal can mirror the old one but with airbridges!,4,0
cape-town-airport,S Rautenbach,,I found Cape Town airport one of the better airports in South Africa. Did not have to wait ages for bags to arrive like other airports they were out in 5 mins through customs in under 10 mins and in a car to the hotel. Staff were so much more friendly than Johannesburg airport and the whole airport is much cleaner and easier to get around.,4,0
cape-town-airport,M Preston,,45 minutes to wait for luggage when only one international flight had landed is simply unacceptable or to quote the word which was one of the options on the SMS questionnaire that passengers can complete pathetic. Also the luggage was delivered to a different carousel to the one shown on the boards. The aircraft I arrived on (EK) was parked away from the terminal and we were bussed to the terminal. The driver did not bother to park close to the steps and passengers had to walk through puddles of rainwater. The airport has good facilities is extremely clean and immigration was reasonably fast. Large areas are still under construction and I prefer not to think what might happen with the 2010 football matches. It is clear though that they are making an effort and are responsive to feedback as I received a call from a lady at the airport not long after sending off the SMS questionnaire..,3,0
cape-town-airport,S Srinivasan,,Despite the construction CPT domestic terminal is a cinch to get through. There's a short walk from the plane to terminal building and vice versa. The baggage collection area is a bit drab but our bags were out in about 10 minutes. On arrival there's a long walk from the drop-off area to the terminal building due to the construction but once inside no queues at all either in the check-in areas or in security. At 6:45 on a weekday morning we went from drop-off to the gate in 10 minutes flat. The porters aren't nearly as imposing as at JNB either. All common areas past security were clean and inviting with plenty of shops restaurants and seating.,4,0
cape-town-airport,Mark Guthrie,,Things have taken a turn for the worse while CPT is being rebuilt. Sign posting for the entry to international car hire return location is non-existent. We drove round in circles repeatedly and never found it and had to park in the short term car park. Avis staff were less than sympathetic although acknowledging the problem. The pedestrian route from the international car rentals location to the international terminal is also poorly sign posted. The queuing system a in the international terminal at security was badly organized.,3,0
cape-town-airport,M Marais,,Arrived at Cape Town International 2 weeks ago was a pleasant experience. Helpful and friendly staff.

cape-town-airport,L Irvine,,I and my family use Cape Town airport 6 times a year at least. Friendly efficient and comparatively safe. Johannesburg on the other hand is fraught with sulky staff under-trained and very unsafe. We have been accosted in the lifts twice. And now there is the problem of people being followed from Johannesburg airport and hijacked.,4,0
cape-town-airport,D Hamp-Adams,,I've travelled through this airport over the last 26 years and it's still a pleasure. Immigration queues struggle in the morning but staff are friendly and polite. Baggage is fast and efficient. Check in long haul - pleasant and efficient [hooray for BA online check in!]. The line after security gets longer every time I fly. Domestic flights: Check in - reasonably short lines but after security departures can be a bit congested so if you're at the front enjoy the lounges. Arrivals - what a pleasure bags there in no time. Shopping is reasonable but the international departures arrangement via the bus means a lot of time standing around in an otherwise empty departure area away from the restaurants and shops. About the only thing I can think of that needs improving.,4,0
cape-town-airport,Anne Baynton,,Arrived and departed this airport with complete ease speed and helpfulness. The airport is beautifully clean and welcoming. I have used it many times on long haul from UK and it is a pleasure always.,,0
cape-town-airport,Ron Kuhlmann,,Pleasant airport overall with nice open areas. The arrival coincided with BA but we were first and did not have any undue delays. On departure the computers were down so much was done manually but with no significant inconvenience.,,0
cape-town-airport,Els van den Berkhof,,After our overnight flight it was great to arrive in an airport like Cape Town. Small clean and easy to find your way around. Because our SAA plane arrived together with a British plane there were a few hundred people to go through immigration by passing only a few manned desks. Because I had had eye-surgery just 3 weeks before I could not handle the queues and was perfectly willing to sit them out on chairs next to the bathrooms. However within 5 minutes we were picked up and escorted outside to the car rental desk. Absolutely great. In Schiphol Airport people were nowhere near as friendly  attentive and helpful. Our next trip to S.A. will absolutely start in Cape Town!,,0
cape-town-airport,Paul Howgate,,Just returned from using this airport. Arrivals is still chaos with too few staff on and has been subject to many protests from local people. Departures was fine though on my day no queues and through with no delays at all. Used the Rennies lounge (also KLM & Virgin Business class lounge) this time and very good value for money. Can be purchased if travelling economy. Apart from arrivals no complaints.,,0
cape-town-airport,Paul Mason,,Queues for International departures stretched from the ground floor through security to the Immigration departure Hall. Why? Just three of eighteen desks manned four long haul wide bodied departures at this time of day so maybe 1400 people departing within 20 minutes. Two flights were delayed because of this. Seems like inefficiency on Immigration's part as one airline rep said it happening all the time. Wake up Cape Town the African World cup is only just round the corner!,,0
cape-town-airport,Michael R Preston,,An excellent airport in all respects apart from limited catering facilities and one which has greatly improved over the thirty or so years I've been using it regularly. However I had an 'interesting' experience on Saturday night (24 SEP). Whilst waiting at the check- in to sort out a minor problem with my ticket I asked the lady if I could weigh myself on the baggage scale as I was curious to see how much weight I'd picked up on the last trip. My normal weight is between 64-66 kgs. You may imagine my surprise when it registered me as 47 kgs. I got on and off again with the same result! I told her jokingly that I would be happy to use that same scales with my wine laden overweight suitcase on my next trip. I then went to the next counter which showed my weight as 78 kgs (also twice.) A third and fourth one were correct. I do wonder if there is some sort of scam going on here as I find it hard to imagine that such a huge error could not have been picked up and addressed.,,0
cape-town-airport,M Fink,,This was my first time in RSA and Cape Town was a good choice of entry. The building is spacious modern and light and I was through the busy and commendably thorough immigration section within 20 minutes which was impressive given the size of the queues. The only difficulty encountered was with the car park payment machines many of which seemed to be breaking down and which also accepted only a few values of notes resulting in long queues.,,0
caracas-airport,Nicole Smith,Canada,Each time I have flown in and out it has been easy. The lines moves quickly and everyone is friendly and helpful. Upon arrival after passing through immigration you proceed to the baggage carousel and hope that your luggage has made it to your destination with you but don't try to walk away with your suitcase that easily someone will be standing by to check your baggage tag and your passport.,5,0
caracas-airport,Alasdair Brooks,,Nearly two years on from the most recent review by A Hetier and much remains familiar at Maiquetia. Entering the country is easy and immigration is quick and friendly. Leaving the international terminal however is a far more stressful experience. The problem seems to stem from the multiple security agencies operating at the airport who often duplicate security checks. So one set of police screened everyone queueing at the check-in desk. Once in the customs/immigration area carry-on bags were x-rayed twice in rapid succession by two entirely different security groups. Then - and this was the real delay - passengers were called from the boarding gate in groups of 5-7 at fifteen to twenty minute intervals to go down to the working area of the airport for hand inspections of their already checked-in suitcases. I was in the penultimate group to be called down for an inspection at 6 PM - for a flight that was supposed to have left at 4:20. Some passengers claimed that TAP (with whom I was flying) and Iberia are singled out for this type of additional security check; others claimed it was common on all international flights though perhaps not to the same degree we were experiencing. I can't verify either of these claims. And even after these suitcase checks our carry-on bags (already x-rayed twice remember) had to be be hand searched in the airbridge by the same police force who had been checking our passports at check-in. These constant overlapping checks can cause significant waits and long delays. It took me two and a half hours to complete the check-in and immigration formalities and after that my flight was then almost four hours late leaving. Do also make sure that you have _more_ Bolivares than you think you need for taxes as all taxes have to be paid in cash. In addition to the airport tax (currently BsF 162.50) I had to pay an additional BsF 30.50 at check-in as the separate departure tax - usually included in tickets - had gone up in August forcing everyone to pay the difference in cash. Several passengers had only brought enough Bs to pay the airport tax and were placed in some difficulty since the ATMs upstairs only accept local Venezuelan cards (in a pinch some of the travel agencies downstairs will reportedly forward you cash; at a price). For all that airside is modern with plentiful duty free and food options - some of which will take a non-Venezuelan credit card - so at least you won't go hungry. I also used the domestic terminal several times in July and August. This is considerably easier to leave than the international terminal and I always found it a pleasant and stress-free experience. Do be careful though if your flight is using Gate/Puerta 5. This is not a standard gate but rather where the buses for smaller planes that don't use airbridges leave from; announcements for boarding are called out by an airline representative and actual boarding does not always match what the airport departure boards claim is happening. You need to pay attention and speak enough Spanish (not a huge amount to be honest) to understand these verbal boarding announcements. Like international airside in the domestic terminal is clean modern and with plentiful food options. The usual warnings about not taking unlicensed taxis from Maiquetia still apply; if at all possible have someone meet you and if this isn't possible only take an official taxi booked from the official desks. The warnings about robbery and express kidnappings from unlicensed taxis should be taken very seriously. Harassment inside the terminal however isn't as bad as some airports I've used. It was less full-on than the old Bangkok airport for example.,3,0
caracas-airport,A Hetier,,One needs more than arriving 2 hours before take-off time for international flights. I would suggest 3. Queues are terrible everywhere (check-in taxes immigration). And why taxes can't be paid by card?! On arrival migration services seem more efficient (search me...) and luggage is delivered efficiently. It is a pity not to be able to get money from an ATM in the international space (only local cards seem to work). On departure when you pass migration you get into a renewed part of the airport with plenty of space totally different from the departure area which is crowed. Duty free shops are nice as well as the food offer. Some don't like the patterns on the floor of the departure area but it's one of the charms of Maiquetía airport. Another one is the take-off and landing especially at daytime. I always enjoy the landscape.,3,0
caracas-airport,Richard Conduit,,"Caracas airport despite many improvements still has a very long way to go to be thought of as anything more than adequate. The mad ""tax"" system where you pay to get out. A rather surprising total of six separate search points. The woeful queues at Immigration both inbound and outbound. The lack of a covered walkway between International and Domestic terminals. The constant unwanted attention from taxi touts and money changers.",2,0
caracas-airport,John Henry,,"Despite the ""new"" international terminal ~ give yourself several hours to check-in. It took me 2 hours 15 minutes at American the other morning.",,0
caracas-airport,Francisco Solano,,I've been in CCS many times and the improvements made to the airport are incredible. Very friendly and helpful staff. Still it is not a modern airport but manageable considering the amount of passengers. The only bad thing is that they are not paying attention to the security and when you are in the arrivals hall a bunch of people come and ask you if you want a taxi or maybe you want to buy the local currency - I undestand this due to the political situation the country is facing but as I always say it could and must be better.,3,0
caracas-airport,M Duggan,,I agree entirely with Fernando. Immigration staff also very helpful as well as friendly and efficient. Only problem now is the collapsed bridge on the road to Caracas. A diversion has been made but is only two lanes and is operated on a tidal system. Can add an hour or two to the journey.;,,0
caracas-airport,Fernando Moibani,,I guess Mr. E Bernal hasn't been to CCS Int´l recently. This airport has been totally renewed. since June a brand new arrival area was opened with about 40 desks and very friendly staff. Deplane go through immigration and picking up your luggage takes about 20 minutes. So I recommend you to save those US$ 200 and continuing to fly through Caracas. By the way I did not know that there were flights from Maracaibo to Aruba.,,0
caracas-airport,E Bernal,,I have flown into Maracaibo via CCS twice this year (both Air France) and after both experiences I have to remind myself to fly via Aruba next time even with the extra 200 EUR of flying KLM (AMS- Aruba). The reasons - All European flights arrive around the same time so you can imagine the line at the immigration counters. Of 10 desks on both times there were only 3 open. First time we queued for 1.5 hours (and the suitcases were waiting outside next to the belt). The second time we risked missing our connecting flight so an officer kindly let us skip the +2 hrs queue at the time we got on the line. The international and domestic terminals are not connected so when transferring it takes a 10 min walk (and carrying your suitcases) under a devil sun. You are not allowed to take the trolleys out of the terminals so the option you have (unless you carry it yourself) is to pay for a porter. I don't know how much it is since we decided to carry them ourselves. Be sure to cool off later on as the AC is barely noticeable inside the terminals. Domestic terminal same chaos as international. Upon departure make sure to check in as soon as it is open - same immigration queues! We were almost the first ones checking in and it still took us more than 30 mins to get through immigration! I must say however it is being remodelled and the new international departure area (before entering secure zone) has a nice food court incl Subway and TGI Fridays. Among others I have flown into Nigeria via Lagos and I must say Caracas is the worst airport I have ever encountered and will avoid it whenever possible. Departure tax is also more expensive than when flying out directly from Maracaibo (nice small international airport).,,0
caracas-airport,Kim Shephard,,"On my last visit I found many issues which dismayed me regarding Simon Bolivar International Airport. (1) Only 2 ATM's in the entire international Terminal(side by side unsignposted and upstairs in the Mezzanine Level) - both ""out of order"". (2) Several Bank outlets in the main terminal concourses - closed in the middle of the day. (3) Inability to take luggage carts from the baggage claim area outside the exits into the main Arrivals Hall. (4) Excessive number of ""pushy"" unregulated (and mostly uninsured) taxi touts. The airport authority regulates (or attempts to) taxis and there is an offical Taxi / Transportation counter in the Arrivals hall. (5) On Departure from the country there is an airport user tax which must be paid prior to security / immigration. The organisation and collection of this farcical and woefully inadequate. In the airport's defense I would say it has one of the better Tourist Information desks of many South American airports but while the staff may be friendly and helpful there are all too few of them. Food selection and outlets are reasonable and shopping appears quite inexpensive.",,0
caracas-airport,Cecilio Khulongo,,It had been about four years since my last visit to CCS int'l and I don't really know what to think about it. The airport was or is being rebuilt and it looks really nice with lots of shops and everything but the staff are really rude and unkind. Four years ago it was all the contrary the airport was a chaos but the staff was very nice and polite. So - is that the price the airport has to pay so that it can be rebuilt?,,0
caracas-airport,B Duve,,The shops are nice and cheap and the staff = helpful and nice but the tax collecting system they have is ridiculous and unfriendly.,,0
caracas-airport,Francois le Pitre,,My impression was that the departing area is too crowded I consider CCS airport as big but definitively it urgently needs more space. The system they have to collect the taxes is inconvenient and archaic. Why don’t they just include all taxes in the ticket so that all passengers can avoid wasting their time that filling down those two forms causes? The departing area is ok pretty dark but it's impossible not to realize the amazing piece of work all along the floor made by a local artist. The airport has many cafes and restaurants and stores as well and although at first you feel a little scared because of the presence of military all around the airport the staff is incredibly nice.,,0
caracas-airport,Julio Acosta,,Nice place to be with duty free shops that offer convenient prices. Pretty crowded but it's ok a little noisy but the airport staff are really nice friendly and helpful. It's being renovated so it's getting a new and very modern image.,,0
caracas-airport,Ivan Maderov,,A new arrival terminal is being built and a enormous area with restaurants stores and open spaces for the art was opened the last semester of 2002. They also built a conventions center outside the airport that is meant to be used as an area to receive important personalities of the politic and artistic world. Also the Hilton chain is building a hotel just across the street of the international arrivals. The international cargo area was massively expanded and they are also going to build another runaway. I think that such a modern city as Caracas really needed its airport to be renovated  besides Caracas Intl works as a hub for many European and Latin American airlines so the passengers traffic is being increasing during the last 5 years. What I would criticize of all this renovation is the fact that they eliminated the great open terrace from where you could feel the breeze of the sea and see the landing and the taking off of airplanes while having a cold drink.,,0
caracas-airport,Patrick Horn,,"Having lived in Venezuela many years I've flown in and out of Caracas' Simon Bolivar airport many times. The airport was nothing special up until they began a massive renovation project a couple of years ago. A new hotel is being built at the airport and the international terminal is being greatly upgraded. Work should be completed soon but like many other projects in Venezuela it will probably be delayed some. Additionally the duty-free shops have been expanded and improved. The shops belong to the same chain of duty-free shops found in Spain's airports called ""Aldeasa.""",,0
carcassonne-airport,S Corcoran,Ireland,I found Carcassonne Airport to be very easy to use. My mother who has limited mobility has difficulty walking or standing for long periods so Carcassonne Airport which is tiny suited us very well. We didn't see a shop but we had something to eat there which was adequate. The taxi rank is just outside the building. We found Carcassonne Airport the taxi service and the Cite to be so easy to navigate and so hassle-free that we're going again this year. I would recommend Carcassonne and the airport for a short break as so little time is wasted at the airport.,8,1
carcassonne-airport,J Williamson,United Kingdom,Very small airport but that can be an advantage as it was for us. By the time we had cleared customs our bags were through and in 5 minutes were at the car hire office 50 feet away and on the road in minutes. On return no queuing to check-in and security took no time at all. Had good breakfast in restaurant upstairs. Only problem might be if more than one flight arriving or departing at the same time. Only complaint not enough seats once airside.,8,1
carcassonne-airport,Dave Entwistle,,"Blast from the past with these reviews. I've recently been using Salvaza again as an alternative method to get from Liverpool to Toulouse though unfortunately it's getting worse. Nathan Fotheringill mentions in his review that he doesn't know how they would cope with two flights at the same time. The answer is ""with great difficulty"" Queuing up outside to check in was bad enough in the heat wouldn't fancy it in the rain at all. This was last Sunday (1st Aug 2010) with a Porto flight at 1530 & Liverpool one at 1535. 2 hours was only just enough time to get through the mayhem caused by the lack of signage and frustrated staff. Incidentally I'm not blaming the staff but the management who should seriously think of investing in this place before everyone starts abandoning it. Back to the old Manchester to Toulouse bit again. A bit more expensive but a lot more efficient.",2,0
carcassonne-airport,Neil Walker,,Don't expect too much of this little airport but it is friendly and the departures lounge has expanded recently. At one time the only facilities were the toilets once you were through the security but now there is a vending machine for soft drinks and chocolate etc. The restaurant (upstairs) has a good menu and they are fully aware of the flight times so you don't have to wait for hours for your meal. There is one small shop (outside the security check area) which doesn't help if you want to take those items through with you that are ordinarily banned. The security staff also apply an interesting interpretation on what is dangerous: we had a travel iron confiscated from our hand luggage as it could be used as a blunt instrument. On the way back we could have bought one at Stansted - presumably traveling from the UK we weren't likely to brain anyone with it.,3,0
carcassonne-airport,E Farrell,,Nice airport. Staff very friendly and helpful. Nice restaurant food excellent and staff very friendly.,,0
carcassonne-airport,Nathan Fotheringill,,This airport is in need of some investment as the current building is barely adequate for a full 737-800 load of passengers. On arrival you will almost certainly have to queue outside to squeeze into the arrivals hall. Your bags should not take too long to arrive however. We departed on the 09:40 Ryanair flight to Stansted arriving at the airport two hours prior to departure as recommended. The airport was closed! The very nice restaurant upstairs is worth a visit after checking in - don't expect any facilities at all once you have passed through security. Our flight was only half full so there was plenty of room at the gate. A full aircraft would have made the place very crowded. I don't kow how they would cope with two flights departing at the same time.,,0
carcassonne-airport,Ben Milner,,Suffering under the strain of extra Ryanair flights the current extension works mean a marquee now covers departures. There is a tiny baggage carrousel which is woefully inadequate for 189 people arriving on a Ryanair 737-800. Hopefully when the works are completed they'll have created enough room for growth. Shuttle Bus to town (Stops at SNCF Station and 'Cite Medieval') for 5 EURO each way takes 10 to 20 minutes into town.,,0
carcassonne-airport,Andrew Smith,,Great little airport clean well sign posted and accessible. There is no duty free but it does have a small shop selling local produce. On the upper level is a lovely restaurant and next to that a cafe/bar over looking the one runway. It's my favourite airport because it's so simple to use.,,0
carcassonne-airport,Philip Woolford,,Small airport. Don't bother arriving too early for your flight as the shops don't open when the booking desks do 2 hours before the flight leaves. Absolutely nothing except toilets after customs.,,0
cardiff-airport,A Thomas,United Kingdom,"Hadn't been to Cardiff for a number of years due to poor flight choices. This time I was on Business. Great car parking and shuttle service. The security experience was horrendous. Staff were aggressive and patronising. As I had some liquids in my case, they quite rightly had to inspect it. However this was done in front of everyone with all personal belongings shown to everyone who was passing. It was an unnecessarily humiliating experience and easily solvable by having a screened area. The security staff were very unpleasant however and seemed to take great delight in ordering passengers around.  I might have thought this was a one off but on my return trip we were again 'barked at' and ushered unpleasantly and officiously whilst having our passports checked.  I will fly from Bristol or Heathrow from now on. I will not be going back. ",2,0
cardiff-airport,John Hawkin,United Kingdom,"Outward, my grumble was the extremely high prices for food and drink at the Echo bar! The return experience was the worst I've experienced. Upon arrival there was a very long walk from the arrivals gate to immigration where we joined a queue which took over 30 minutes to get to the front. There were 3 immigration officers on duty, 1 of whom just sat and looked at the queue and served no one. My hope was that with the delay in clearing immigration, our luggage would be on the belt. Unfortunately, this was not the case and  we had another 20 minute wait for the luggage (50 minutes after arrival!). After leaving the terminal, we tried to find the bus stop for the courtesy bus to car park 2. It was really badly signed and when we did get it's location verified by an airport worker, we had another 20 minute wait for the bus. To top it all, there didn't appear to be any visible exit signs, so another 5 minutes was wasted driving around. ",2,0
cardiff-airport,AMR WALSH,Ireland,Very limited choice of shops and eating facilities compared to alternative airports.,2,0
cardiff-airport,Marc Jones,United Kingdom,Having decided to go to Prague for the weekend of my wife's birthday my children and I decided to do the costings as this was going to be her 60th birthday present. Can you imagine the shock that the price's quoted from our (local airport we live in Porthcawl) were so much more than the package we put together flying from Bristol including the parking and 3 nights in the Hilton in Prague! As the people of Wales airport you are a country mile from getting it anywhere near right.,,0
cardiff-airport,Tony Quinn,United Kingdom,After many years of using Bristol airport we decided to give Cardiff another go (we only live 8 miles from CWL). The main problem is the poor choice of flights but we managed to get a flight to Barcelona which almost fitted our needs. The airport's recent modernisation seems to be pretty good. Drop-off area was good and no charge (well done CWL). Check-in staff were fine security was no worse nor no better than most airports we use so all in all not bad. As part of the modernisation Cardiff seems to have followed the Bristol plan - enlarge the Duty Free shops at the expense of seating - not good. The catering is average but the prices are eye wateringly expensive over £2 for a cup of tea is such a rip-off. I thought the Welsh government owned this airport. They should stop such profiteering. Would we use the airport again. The answer is most definitely yes if suitable flights are available but that's the snag there aren't many flights to anywhere.,7,1
cardiff-airport,K Harris,United Kingdom,I was checking in my disabled grandmother and the staff were nothing but miserable rude and unhelpful. I saw a smile from one member of staff while checking in my grandmother and I felt we were made to feel a nuisance to these people. At one point someone told me to 'put her in a chair and take her to a desk!' Then they had a cheek to charge me 5 pounds for parking as it obviously takes longer to assist a person who requires a wheelchair. I phoned to complain and again felt the staff were not bothered and refused to refund me telling me to call another department. Not happy at all.,,0
cardiff-airport,P Cairnduff,United Kingdom,Much smaller than I imagined for a capital city airport and not one that I would want to be stuck in for too long as facilities are quite limited but overall a positive experience with short queues and friendly staff. A nice touch was a machine at the security exit allowing passengers to rate their experience. I hope these results are looked at and acted upon and believe that every airport should do it as it is often seems that it is this part of the travel process that determines how good or bad a passenger's overall experience is.,6,1
cardiff-airport,G Emlyn,United Kingdom,I will never use Cardiff Airport again. My wife and I have always used Cardiff for holidays but after being let down three times over one holiday never again. We are going to Bristol for the first time this year and even through its further away I believe we wont be let down. We have had our flights changed three times from Cardiff and we did not know what time we are supposed to fly or even if we can take two suitcases that we had paid for! I am sorry to say that I have lost faith in Cardiff airport. Is it any wonder people are going elsewhere? Also Cardiff is an international airport not a regional airport what a bad joke.,,0
cardiff-airport,D Osborne,Germany,My experience of this airport was positive. I can't understand all the negative reviews trashing the place. Staff were friendly. Security also efficient and friendly. Seemed a little bit too quiet for a modern airport. I know they are trying to attract more business and I really hope they succeed. I'd read all kinds of horror stories about the place but it was fine. I'd been using KLM to travel into Bristol as it's usually a little bit cheaper but will definitely use their service into Cardiff again as it is closer to my destination.,10,1
cardiff-airport,S Howell,United Kingdom,We have flown from Cardiff airport for over 30 years. My mother and father used to fly twice a year back and forth between Dublin in the late 50's and early 60's and as a child I flew regularly between Cardiff and Dublin to visit family. As a family I my husband and my two teenage sons have used the airport since 2001. In December 2001 we flew on a day trip to Lapland. In 2006 it was with Thomson to Sanford Florida and experienced no problems. Again in 2008 to Sanford Florida with Monarch. In this occasion we arrived at the airport at 4am for our 7 am flight and didn't check in until 6.15 due to a computer crash. We then used the airport in 2009 to fly to Dublin. We didn't return until 2012 where we flew back to Dublin. We are flying yet again to Dublin in October this year and are hoping to have another stress free experience at this airport!,9,1
cardiff-airport,N Hobbs,United Kingdom,Very disappointed that since the take over of Cardiff airport no budget airline has returned eg. BMI Baby or would be nice to see Ryanair or EasyJet. Living in Wales we should be able to get flights for the same price as available from Bristol airport and not get the extra flight supplements also more competitive airlines than Thomson or Thomas Cook. I and many friends and family choose to travel to Bristol driving past Cardiff airport as there is usually a saving of at least £600 per family booking when travelling from Bristol with these airlines. Cardiff really needs to look at the services and flights available if it is going to develop in a competitive market.,1,0
cardiff-airport,Matthew Davies,United Kingdom,I have just read the previous reviews and I'm sorry but I totally disagree with them! Quick check in quick through security yes they are strict but welcome to a modern safety conscious airport. Compared with some of the modern airports it could do with modernising however that really does not bother me. Parking was cheap at the Holiday Inn Express with a free taxi to the front door which took 2 minutes altogether. Cardiff airport has retained another passenger and would recommend to anyone else.,10,1
cardiff-airport,Andrew Graham,United Kingdom,Dull ugly and (worst of all) the most unreliable and infrequent airport-to-city centre transport system of any airport I have known. Little wonder the airport is a white elephant recently bailed out by the Welsh Assembly government. You will arrive and discover that there are no taxis (these must be ordered) no trains (although there is a train link some distance away requiring a taxi!) and (most shameful of all) buses that depart once every 45 minutes! The latter are poorly signed and the whole this is a fiasco. I arrived on a flight at Cardiff Airport at 7.30pm and the terminal was closed. We were escorted through an area by airport staff to an exit and dumped outside to fend for ourselves (see above about lack of transportation). It was like flying to Uzbekistan circa 1953! I urgently recommend that you fly to Bristol instead then take the train. Failing that just don't go to Cardiff.,,0
cardiff-airport,Jeff Cooper,United Kingdom,Being disabled at Cardiff airport is a nightmare. We leave the car at the highwayman parking their mini bus parks in front of the airport and this is where the trouble starts. I have to try and get a suitcase up 5 steps while walking with a walking stick at check-in it was not explained how far gate 13 was. The experience happens in reverse when I land surely slopes would be better then steps to the car park.,5,0
cardiff-airport,E McCann,Ireland,I have used many airports in the world and have had very different experiences in each. However Cardiff airport is unique. The infrastructure is dilapidated and reminiscent of some early Soviet political chambers. The shenanigans inside the building provided by the 'security' folk is astounding. A very unpleasant (and unnecessary) thorough frisking. The security staff were disrespectful and appeared to be jeering when the bleeper sounded at the security gate. It is the boat for me in future.,,0
cardiff-airport,M King,United Kingdom,"We have used this airport on a regular basis and every time we are structure by how unfriendly most of the staff are. The security/customs people are rude and intimidating. The NCP staff unbelievably pathetic in attitude and all they have to do is authorise a pre booked ticket. We flew in from Amsterdam and what a contrast in how the Dutch run an airport. This airport is the ""gate way"" to Wales. What a bad advertisement. Its now owned by the Council. Tax payers money being wasted. Close it.",1,0
cardiff-airport,S Littlewood,United Kingdom,We regularly fly throughout the year from Cardiff or Bristol. Bristol airport lounge is excellent value however Cardiff airport lounge limits you to two alcoholic drinks! I do not want to get drunk at the airport but two wines or beers for my husband over 3 hours is pathetic! Out of curiosity I've clicked on the terms and conditions of numerous airports throughout the country and haven't come across any others that limit the drinks. Bristol airports 'Silver parking zone' is excellent and extremely well managed compared with what's on offer at Cardiff. Cardiff airport is supposed to be trying to encourage more people to use it but these are just two examples of why we prefer to fly from Bristol.,4,0
cardiff-airport,John Evans,United Kingdom,As I am a Welshman I am saddened to have to write a review of this nature about the Welsh international airport. I was unfortunate to use CWL for a return flight to Turkey recently. I had heard the news about difficulties at the airport and airlines pulling out but could it be that bad? A travel rep. told me they had difficulty selling flights from Cardiff and flights were being reduced. After being there I understand why! On arrival at the terminal I found that the check in queues for the Thomson desks were reaching outside the entrance. With travellers having to arrive up to 3 hours before flying and waiting for what seemed forever to actually check in the facilities for having a meal both before entering and in the departure lounge are very poor. Eventual boarding was good. On our return in the early hours of the morning the only flight to land waiting for our cases became an exercise in patience. Some cases would arrive and there would be up to a 15 min wait for the next batch (I think they were unloading using a wheelbarrow) in all for not a very big plane it took well over an hour to deliver all the luggage. It would seem on speaking to fellow sufferers this is the norm! Will I be using CWL again? Only if there is no alternative.,,0
cardiff-airport,R Derrick,United Kingdom,Be aware that Cardiff airport has now introduced a £2 charge for use of the luggage trolley - a 'trolley tax'! I was absolutely furious to find this new situation upon returning last Friday. All the other passengers were equally outraged. Clearly they want to lose yet more passengers. Next time we'll probably fly from London.,2,0
cardiff-airport,Robert Edwards,United Kingdom,I used to use this airport on a regular (every week) basis changing in Amsterdam for my final destination. Over the years (last 10) this airport has become a disgrace. Starting with the primitive parking facilities - not so cheap - and security outside that would be acceptable to a US embassy - to the grotty interior underworked and over zealous security staff inside. I now get up 2 hours earlier and drive to Heathrow. Sometimes use Bristol - it's not bad at all and far superior to Cardiff.,,0
cardiff-airport,Ian Matthews,United Kingdom,"Despite it being the most local we'll take Bristol or Birmingham next time. Not content with ripping people off at every opportunity (parking drop-off fees etc.) now they charge for having those ludicrous ""security"" bags. However the real problem is the menacing security theatre. Getting menaced by them has become routine upon returning to Cardiff and it's not much fun on the way out either. Getting grilled with questions about our holiday time away business money spent purpose etc. all leading up to a full going-through of our baggage is humiliating and frightening. We are citizens returning to our own country. Someone should tell the Cardiff security this.",1,0
cardiff-airport,Tony Quinn,United Kingdom,We recently used this airport for the first time in 25 years (moved back to Cardiff). Parking was close enough to the terminal to walk and was incredibly cheap. Check-in was no different from any other airport I have ever used and security is no worse either (always a trial anywhere). Prices at the bar and cafe were shocking (more expensive than Heathrow) but you don't have to buy. On our return we were off the plane and in the car within 20 minutes and that was after collecting bags which is pretty good in my experience. Other reviews moan about charges for Pick-up and Drop-off but most UK airports now do this and there is a free area if you wish to use it. It's a shame that there are not more flights but this might cause its own problems with congestion. I desperately want to use my local airport so I hope the management does something to attract more airlines to Cardiff. Cardiff Airport has the potential to be a first class regional hub.,8,1
cardiff-airport,K Creighton,United Kingdom,Flew twice this Summer from Cardiff as I live locally everything went like clockwork but unable to check in online and airport looking very run down. What must visitors to the only airport in Wales think.,8,0
cardiff-airport,R Davies,United Kingdom,This has to win the prize as the worst airport in the world. You are charged a £1 to drop off which is not even outside the terminal they have gone crazy in the name of security. You can park outside Heathrow terminals and get out of the car with bags etc and free of charge. The check in desks are abysmal and slow considering they hardly have any flights going through and the security area is painfully slow rude and inefficient. They had a nice flight to Zurich flying out of the airport the last few months and I now see that they have lost that to Bristol.,2,0
cardiff-airport,A Gough,United Kingdom,We haven't flown from Cardiff Airport for over 3 years despite it being our closest and most convenient airport as we live in west Wales - we decided to give both Cardiff and Vueling airlines a chance as we usually fly from Bristol (far more choice of flights and usually half the price). We arrived 3 hours before our flight and due to horrendous service at check-in and awful service through security check we only just got through to departures with 5 mins to go - disaster of an airport really needs to sort itself out. We will not be returning to Cardiff and we have just booked our October half term flights with Ryanair from Bristol. They seem to be ripping any remaining customers they have left off for every penny they can! As they are now charging to drop off near the airport - this is a total disgrace we have 2 young children and we need to get them out as close to airport as possible together with cases while I park at the overpriced car park - but here in Cardiff I now have to pay a pound just to drop off my wife and kids.,2,0
cardiff-airport,T Buckley,United Kingdom,Since BMI baby has left this airport it has become far to expensive to use the airport from now on all our holidays will be from Bristol or Birmingham. I personally can not see this airport lasting much longer and the management are closing this airport by out pricing its use to the working class people I have just priced a return flight for September this year from Cardiff to Alicante Spain and it comes to £149.00 from Cardiff and the same flight from Bristol is £46.00.,2,0
cardiff-airport,S Smith,United Kingdom,Incredibly small airport which has it's good and bad points. No queues at check-in and security are always welcome. However major shortage in places to eat needs to be addressed. Waiting areas were clean as were the toilets - both before and after security. Ground staff were very helpful and friendly. Better advice on how to reach the city centre wouldn't go wrong however!,6,1
cardiff-airport,Paul Richards,Australia,Avoid this ironically-named airport especially if you're not a local and especially if you're using it to arrive. If you've found and survived one of the limited flights followed by a long wait and an over-the-top interrogation at passport control (which seems to be standard for non- Europeans) then comes the punch - you're in the middle of nowhere and you won't get any help. It's hard to believe that an airport like this still exists.,2,0
cardiff-airport,Ian Arnold,,I fly from this airport regularly to NCL and although it has very basic faciilities it's very quick to get through check in/security and onto the plane. I only use the coffee shop and it's always open when I pass through. Shame there is only a limited range of scheduled services from the airport though.,3,0
cardiff-airport,Ian Hume,,It's going downhill even further. The shuttle bus to the newly-built link railway station is being retired from the end of May leaving pax without a car to a disorganised bus service. And guess what? The only hand scanner for self-printed (online) checkin documents was out of order again today. Unsuspecting travellers thus had to return downstairs to the departures hall queue up at checkin lines often waiting up to 20 mins for a card boarding pass. I suggest that regular travellers send in their spare change to the Airport Manager so the Airport Appeal for a Second Scanner Fund can buy a secondhand backup reader from a more efficient airport. That said staff here are fine and often a bit frustrated at the inefficiencies from management.,2,0
cardiff-airport,G Powell,,Cardiff is a typical small airport which has traditionally been principally for charter flights. Over the years I have seen its custom fall away as charter customers switch to Bristol and Birmingham both of which offer far better service. Cardiff has tried to reinvent itself as an 'International class' airport but it is never going to compete with the likes of Birmingham and that has failed miserably. Because of security restrictions the roof is never open and the upper floor rarely accessible. The building has all the charm of a Communist era building with few external windows. Compared with Bristol it is very claustrophobic. The land side facilities are minimal. The only positive side is the helpful disabled facilities and support that is offered.,2,0
cardiff-airport,Peter Hodson,,Cardiff Airport has strengths and weaknesses. It is small so you can easily get from one area to another without too much difficulty. It has a pleasant Executive Lounge and a small range of shops. Retrieval of baggage is fairly painless and staff are fairly friendly. However the airport is still set in the 1960's and the major re-construction work to make it a 2000's generation airport has not taken place. The limited choice of flights the supporting services of bars restaurants and car park all create the impression of an airport with limited ambition and initiative. Earlier comments about drop off and pick up remain issues to a certain extent (the logic of having a security barrier at which you are simply waved through without any check seems a particularly useless feature).,3,0
cardiff-airport,Anthony Matthews,,Semi derelict dirty? Not sure how anyone could describe the airport as this - unless they have some sort of an agenda. I use the airport 3 or 4 times a year and find it perfectly acceptable for what I need. Not perfect but then again what airport is? Last week after flying from Edinburgh I disembarked paid for the car parking (not pre-booked) and was out of the airport within 15 mins. What is the problem with that?,4,0
cardiff-airport,S Ford,,Have used Cardiff airport a few times but only due to flight price rather use Bristol even at a higher cost. Staff are friendly but the airport is semi-derelict dirty and the building work never seems to finish and the benefits cannot be seen. Car parking is expensive and the shuttle bus almost non-existant even access by road is difficult. Do'nt believe their claims about being accessible by train.,1,0
cardiff-airport,T Rogers,,I've never really had much problem when flying out of/into Cardiff. The security system needs looking at - passengers standing in queues for over an hour in high season - I witnessed a lady passing out as a result of standing in a non airconditioned room for over an hour. There is only one taxi rank outside the airport but there are local firms that you can ring for a taxi. £27 to Cardiff city (as a previous writer stated) is actually a good price - Cardiff Airport is actually around 12 miles away from the outskirts of the City. I agree that the airport needs to up its standards dramatically to compete as an international airport but it is getting better.,3,0
cardiff-airport,Justin Williams,,Had the misfortune of using Cardiff last week! Arrived early for a check in at 6pm and had a couple of drinks in landside bar imagine our surprise when at 4pm we were told that the bar is closing and that the only bar facility was Airside! We were unable to go airside as check- in for our flight was not till 6pm. We then went to restaurant landside to get a hot meal - the airport closes landside it would appear at 4pm even for food! Once again the response was go Airside! Cardiff airport claim to be an international airport - act like one and have a full service available landside.,1,0
cardiff-airport,Jonathan Grimes,,Travelled out and back the same day to Dublin on Aer Arann. Getting dropped off at the airport requires running the gauntlet of the security staff on the approach road - twice we had to stop and tell them we needed to drive to the airport to drop-off. Security seems a bit over the top - especially as they merely waved us on - didn't check the car ask to see my ticket etc... Checked in on-line so avoided the queues - amazed how many security staff are employed. Arrival back later that evening was very different. The airport is no longer allowing cars to pick-up from outside the terminal - instead cars now have to enter the unlit short stay car park down the road from the terminal building and wait for passengers to find them. Not so easy when its dark and raining. After leaving a very chaotic terminal building I had a difficult time trying to find my lift home. The car park being used is unpaved with mud and gravel underfoot - not sure how anyone would manage with a luggage trolley. It requires a walk along the airport road for a couple of hundred yards. Once I had found my lift (could only do this by means of a mobile phone and directions) it took about 10 minutes to exit the car park as cars were not following any type of one way system - reason - no arrows painted on the gravel. I have no idea what the management of this airport are doing here - the airport is a disgrace to Wales (and the UK for that matter) and I would be ashamed of welcoming any visitor into Wales via this airport.,1,0
cardiff-airport,Joe Bailey,,Really worn and shabby but it is small and one can get through quickly which is definitely good but not a great advertisement for the capital of Wales. There is a lot of room for improvement. It compares poorly to Bristol which is pretty average. The road system between the airport and the city is like something out of another era. This airport really is a bit of throw back in all senses and this a for a city with the millenium stadium.,2,0
cardiff-airport,Martyn Lloyd,,I have never found getting to the airport a problem. The road access is fine - much better than Bristol. However the passport control system on arrival back into Cardiff is a nightmare - the only airport I have known to take so long is Plodiv in Bulgaria!,3,0
cardiff-airport,Anna Inglis,,It's tatty when compared to the likes of Bristol International Airport both in terms of number of destinations you can fly to as well as overall look and feel and the food options are low quality and over priced. On the plus side it's easy to get to by car but public transport options are severely limited and it's a nightmare if you are reliant on a taxi and your flight arrives at the same time as a load of others (expect big queues!) Definitely not a place with the customer at it's heart.,3,0
cardiff-airport,Roger Rees,,Can't understand the fuss with poor road access. Cardiff is much easier to get to than most UK airports. I regularly fly KLM to Schiphol then to Shanghai. CIA is shabby and run-down catering facilities very mediocre but fortunately I don't need to use them as I drive my own car and find I can get from the place very easily. I have never encountered traffic problems. I understand taxi and public transport provision is poor.,3,0
cardiff-airport,B Murphy,,Have flown from Cardiff airport several times in the past 12 years. Little has changed however - the airport is in dire need of a complete make-over. Not the cleanest of places decor old and overall looks more like a bus station. Going through customs coming from an Amsterdam flight also can seem a little nerve-wrecking - many folks are pulled over and usually customs officers with sniffer dogs come over to you I assume sniffing for drugs. This can be a little intimidating with a dog sniffing all over your luggage and person! Outside there is only one taxi company and they can charge 27 pounds sterling for a trip to downtown Cardiff. In contrast if you take a taxi from Cardiff to the airport with another taxi company it will be considerably less! One final note - recently it took me 40 minutes in the morning to get through security leaving Cardiff! In summary although this can be a useful airport to link with Schiphol in Amsterdam in reality it is way below standard and I'm surprised Welsh Tourism and local business do not push for better standards and service. Bristol airport is much nicer!,1,0
cardiff-airport,L Cadwallader,,"Didn't personally fly from Cardiff but we took my daughter and a friend there as they were going on a day's educational visit to Auschwitz. Access was well signposted and the separation of ""drop- offs"" and ""pick-ups"" seemed to work quite well. We were pleasantly surprised at being able to drop off the girls right outside the terminal building without any fuss. Picking them up late at night was less straightforward as they seemed to take ages coming through to the Arrivals area after the plane had landed even though none on their flight had hold luggage to collect. The delay was at passport control as three flights arrived within about 20 minutes of each other. By the time the girls came through the queue for car parking payment at one end of the arrivals area virtually joined the queue at the other end for the (one?) ticket validating machine. Some people obviously got fed up waiting in one or other of these queues so there was a snarl up by the exits from the car park while people left their cars to pay at the ""box"" nearby and others with tickets ready (but time running out) fuming because the exits were blocked. More pay / validation points are needed. As to the airport itself my daughter (used to Liverpool & Manchester) described it as ""sweet""!",3,0
cardiff-airport,Ian Hume,,"When will this minor provincial airport realise it should have aspirations? As previous posts show public transport is poor especially late and early in the day. And it must be one of the few European airports that does not have a taxi rank and where very long waits in a tiny taxi shed are common. The interior is dreary and the up down turn round down up of the maze-like entrance from incoming flights is hardly an 'international arrival' experience. I use it because it is close to home but every journey brings another example of lack of customer focus and management grip. The other morning I was travelling with light hand luggage only and had printed-off my boarding card from the web. Thus I went straight upstairs to security. ""The scanner's not working you'll have to go back downstairs to check in and get a regular boarding card"". That I did queuing up patiently. Then upstairs again where a different member of staff remarked ""sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't"". I asked if she could get a supervisor to put up a prominent notice at the foot of the stairs when their only scanner went out of order like this - just so that pax didn't have to go up the stairs only to have to go down again and then up again. This appeared to be a revolutionary idea for Cardiff. Perhaps they can't source a notice board and marker pen - and I'm sure they haven't thought of having two scanners have they? They certainly haven't trained their staff to be resourceful and pro-active.",2,0
cardiff-airport,Bob Alexander,,We flew into Cardiff airport on Thursday 24th April intending to get public transport to central Cardiff. We missed the two buses that could have got us there (one direct and one via a rail connection) as they left the stand within a couple of minutes of each other and then we had to wait an hour for the next to arrive although one was scheduled to have arrived after about 45 minutes it did turn up but having dropped passengers off it drove away without picking up the waiting passengers. This was at 5pm so hardly an off-peak period!! We returned to the airport on Monday 28th April to fly to Malaga. It took us an hour to check in with bmibaby although there were only about a dozen people in the queue ahead of us. When we got to the desk we were a kilo overweight so we removed a bag of magazines from our suitcase and put it in our cabin bag which was almost empty. This put us below 20 kilos but the girl did not seem too happy at what we had done and insisted that we put the cabin bag in a measuring cradle even though it was a regulation size airline cabin bag. It fitted easily needless to say. Was she resentful at not being able to charge us excess baggage? We have travelled dozens of times all over the world with that bag and never been asked to prove its measurements before. Then it was the turn of the security check into departures. One desk open a large queue of people and further delays. We and others expressed our annoyance at the fact that there were 11 other security staff just hanging about chatting to each other. To add further insult to passengers some 'staff' who had been waiting to clear security were called forward and given priority over paying customers! The general facilities of the airport seem good but clearly there is a major management problem which causes problems for passengers and probably results in loss of revenue for airport shops/cafes etc. as passengers spend so much time in queues they have little time left for anything else.,2,0
cartagena-rafael-nunez-airport,F Vernier,France,Strict minimum no much to do no much space. If you can prefer Avianca vip lounge with snacks drinks and wifi.,4,0
cartagena-rafael-nunez-airport,Richard Jenkins,United States,I did a recent domestic round trip through this airport. Arrival is uncomplicated (no jetways and a short walk to the terminal) although travelers should be aware that the luggage trolleys are only for the use of porters unlike other airports. Taxis await outside the baggage claim. Check-in is more complicated. The first departure area one encounters is actually where ticketed passengers go to reach their gate. The actual check- in is further down the walkway - no signs are provided but employees are quite helpful. The airport appears to be in a state of protracted renovation that is evident at departure - a regular visitor commented that it was different every time he visited there so conditions may change. The security is pretty simple - no removing of watches etc. The gate area is a bullpen and the monitors provide the names of airlines but no departure information. There is a cafe and a small gift shop but little else nearby. Free wifi is provided. Departure announcements are not translated into English or any other language although a large proportion of travelers obviously were foreigners; many from Europe Australia or the USA. Poor acoustics make things difficult even for locals to understand.,5,0
cartagena-rafael-nunez-airport,Adam Tebble,United Kingdom,The airport has undergone refurbishment in recent years and is pleasant and air-conditioned. Security is tight and efficient. One problem is the availability of refreshments. There is only one major cafeteria - located in the walkway between the domestic and international sections of the airport - but it is a rip-off. If you buy something simple like a soda and a chocolate bar though the courtyard by the domestic arrivals area is very pleasant. When you clear customs upon arriving you need to go to the little taxi services window just outside domestic arrivals to request a taxi to go into town. The attendant will then give you a ticket with the fare printed on it depending on where you go. Do not go straight to the taxi rank nearby as the drivers will attempt to harass you into their cab smile a lot and then rip you off! Alternatively if you don't mind a short 2 minute walk you can just walk straight down the street that leads out of the terminal and get a taxi (or even a local bus) much more cheaply.,4,0
casablanca-airport,M Benchekroun,Morocco,Two small entrance doors only for the Terminal 2 therefore long waiting lines. Security check failed in the entrance. Easy identification at the airport. Poorly maintained and dirty WC. Very limited equipment. Average boarding areas. I already tried the main lounge which was not bad but there wasn't a wide enough choice of food. I don't really recommend this airport only for a stopover.,6,0
casablanca-airport,Souk Lan Lim,Singapore,A good experience at Casablanca: it'll never win any awards but my experience was generally positive. I was through immigration in about 15 minutes my bags came in another 10 and I was on a train to Marrakech shortly after. Departure was even better: a quick and smooth check in and then through immigration and security in 15 minutes. The weak point is the overpriced food court in the basement of T2. I expect to be ripped off at airports once they've got you airside but the prices at Casablanca were pretty ridiculous. That said the overall experience was positive.,7,1
casablanca-airport,B Triplett,United States,Worst airport I've ever been to. It took 1.5 hrs to get through immigration. Officers were wandering around aimlessly talking to one another talking on their cell phones congregating in groups with no interest in helping anybody or doing anything while the lines got longer and longer as more flights arrived. A riot almost broke out the crowd was so unruly. The time it took to get the passport stamped averaged about 5-7 minutes per person. One poor family from the Congo talked to an officer for about 30 minutes at one of the windows and was finally told they had to go off to a room somewhere to talk to someone else.,1,0
casablanca-airport,Philip Mortimer,United Kingdom,I fly in and out of CMN once or twice a year and on the whole find it to be ok. There is lots of time waiting for passports to be stamped as each person has to have an immigration number added to their passport. Your bags may seem to take ages to come but a little tip will start them coming through surprisingly quickly. One tip is to get you immigration card filled in before landing as this will delay you otherwise on arrivals or departures. Make sure you have credit on your phone as the airport phones never seem to work. Be careful what you say in your own language in front of some of the officials as they can understand a lot more than you think.,7,1
casablanca-airport,Mark Evans,United Kingdom,Beyond the precincts of this airport is an appealing and welcoming country but passing through CMN is a stressful experience. The facilities look frayed at the edges but are at least functioning but the impression is of an airport that is staffed as part of a job creation exercise with motivation energy and charm being in short supply. Security is a particular bane with backed-up lines and staff relishing the chance to exercise their power by barking at pax. My most recent experience was in transit from a flight that originated in Agadir. All transit passengers having already endured security checks at the point of origin were subject to fresh checks despite tight connections for many. I am in no rush to return.,3,0

casablanca-airport,Dmitry Kuzin,Russian Federation,Transit via CMN on the way to New York. Airport made a good impression because of the convenient terminal good air conditioning caring staff English speaking security.

A pity many shops were closed at night during our layover. I can recommend this airport.,7,1
casablanca-airport,T Shipley,United States,It is difficult to understand how a nation interested in tourism could tolerate such a dysfunctional facility as their primary air gateway. We arrived on a domestic flight from Ouarzazate for a transfer to a Lufthansa connection to DCA via Frankfurt. After finding our way with little or no signage to the transfer desk we found one person working there who pointed us to the other end of the counter for Lufthansa. As we had just over one hour for our transfer we became concerned when no one had showed up to man the desk for more than 30 minutes. No one could or would answer any questions. After an hour a Lufthansa agent arrived and told us that the flight schedule had been changed to one hour later and after many minutes managed to issue a boarding pass. We then proceeded to security where a surly attendant looked at my boarding pass and passport and asked why our passports had not been stamped in Ouarzazate. He then pointed to a desk nearby. Of course there was no one at the desk. Finally the only really pleasant person in the entire airport arrived and processed our passports though rather than stamping the boarding pass for the Casablanca to Frankfurt flight he stamped the one for Frankfurt to Washington. After finally making our way through security we arrived at the gate where there was no arrival/departure board and no one around to answer questions. The only place open for food had sandwiches that looked as if they had been there for several days. We had to wait for Lufthansa to give us something on the plane (in our respective middle seats several rows apart). Not surprisingly when we finally arrived at Washington our luggage was nowhere to be found. Lufthansa got it to us three days later. If you have any option do not fly through Casablanca.,1,0
casablanca-airport,Robert Halverson,United States,This is Morocco's largest and main airport but it is horrible. We arrived from Dubai on Emirates after a 9 hour flight. Immigration lines were about an hour long even though they had several wickets open. Then they randomly screened only half the luggage. There are few stores once you get out into the arrivals hallway. Just a bunch of taxi bullying you into using them. The rail station is downstairs with few signs it is dark and dingy. Trains run every hour and people just abandon their luggage carts in the walkway by the train doors so it becomes an obstacle course to get on and off. No staff collect the carts. When we arrived by train to fly out it was just as bad. They security-screen your luggage as you enter the airport but don't seem to care if you set the metal detector off. We arrived 5 hours in advance. Most PA announcements are in French and Moroccan Arabic very few in English. The check-in opened 3 hours in advance of the flight and we got through Immigration and Customs easily enough. However the departure lounge is horrible. Over priced duty free shops and an overpriced Internet cafe ($10 per hour). There are no lounge chairs. All chairs have arms so you can not lie down across open seats. When our Lufthansa flight was boarding they funnelled everyone out into the gateway outside and then stopped us. Avoid at all costs!,1,0
casablanca-airport,Philip Jensen,Denmark,Casablanca airport provided a very average experience. The young girls managing the check-in counters were more concerned about chatting with each other instead of checking peoples luggage in! So it took forever to check-in. It didn't get better at immigration where the locals pushed forward and tried to skip in line if they could get away with it. And again the staff took their time with checking people. The safety check was an absolute joke! Yes it was the usual as in all other airports but here the staff didn't care about people setting off the metal detector! The airport was clean and had an average amount of shops.,5,1
casablanca-airport,Peter Suschnigg,Canada,"Casablanca must surely rank among the most tourist hostile airports anywhere. My wife and I arrived by Air France from CDG at 3pm and were stuck in the immigration line for 2 hours. There were a number of women with small children in the line and they too had to cool their heels until an immigration official eventually got round to processing them and eventually us. We had a driver waiting to take us to Marrakech and I feared that he might have given up. But no. Apparently this is the norm. The imigration check was somewhat ""speedy."" We got through in only 1 and a half hours. If Morocco is interested in increasing its tourist potential this is not the way to go.",1,0
casablanca-airport,M Zambito,United States,"Probably the worst experience of my life. Not exaggerating. Cigarette buts and stray cats everywhere. ""No smoking"" signs and announcements yet every single individual in the [overpriced] cafe was smoking. No accountability among employees. Spent twenty hours in the airport trying to get on a flight that I had booked. Got bounced between six different desks for hours. Seventeen-hour delays flagrant lies insults and employees and police continuously attempting to extract bribes. The shops will sell you phone cards too but all of the phones are out of order. Most of the ""complimentary"" WCs are half out-of-order and lacking TP. Half of the airport (T3 and the corridor toward it) are unlit unused and poorly laid out. Employees will claim to speak English and French. They don't know English and some of them hardly know French.",1,0
casablanca-airport,Federico Ucci,Italy,"Casablanca is a terrible airport both in tems of facilities and personnel. Despite being an intercontinental airport there is bag deposit facility and no hotel. The closest one is over 3km away. The person at the information desk in the new terminal barely speaks any other language than arabic and is uninformed. When I asked the hotel phone number he didn't even have it written somewhere and had to struggle to remember it by heart! The worst is passport control: when I asked the guy to stamp a used page since I have very few empty ones for my visas he nodded and then stamped a virgin page straight away! I could not believe it! He just said: ""sorry it doesn't matter anyway"".",1,0
casablanca-airport,R Harjo,,"SWhile the new Terminal 2 is spacious clean and well equipped check in-staff are not well trained. I came to the airport and they told me I should have had a hard copy ticket not an electronic ticket and there was nothing they could do about it. I insisted they try and resolve the problem. After waiting until all passengers were checked in I asked again for help. The girl begrudgingly said she'd go to the Main Office and took a French woman passenger with her with a similar problem but told me wait there. They were gone almost an hour and I asked for help from the remaining check in desk woman on duty. She told me she had nothing to do with ""my problem"" so my husband explained in Arabic and asked her politely for help. She was very rude and very angry I asked her for her name. She started screaming at me ""Are you the police? Are you a gendarme? I don't have to tell my name or badge number to anyone but the police."" She refused to call her supervisor and continued her contemptuous and rude treatment towards me yelling at me to go sit down. The police showed up and she calmed down. The other woman then arrived with the French woman she'd helped who also had only an electronic ticket but told me the same thing again ""We will put you on the plane to Lisbon and when you get there get your baggage and go find US Airways and ask them to straighten it out."" The police then escorted me to the plane which was late taking off which had inconvenienced all passengers. And all this problem because they claimed the computer systems don't communicate with Lisbon/US Airways.

Then 1/2 hour before my boarding time a bus pulled up and the police yelled out ""New York"" - I just happened to ask him about my flight to Montreal and he told me to get on the aforementioned bus. This took me to the correct gate for my flight. None of this info is posted announced told to you or on your boarding pass.

casablanca-airport,A Belafkih,,The airport had seen some good and tangible improvements. The problem that needs to be urgently addressed still is transport to and from CMN especially after 2330. This is an airport and many international flights arrive at or around 2300. So please CMN operators don't leave arriving passengers at the mercy of the highly priced and notoriously disorganised taxi drivers. The rating of any airport is measured not only by new buildings and check-in counters but by other services it provides to the public such transport links their availibility and their affordability.,3,0
casablanca-airport,Konstantinos Nastos,,A good effort to facilitate passengers and advance tourist industry but efforts occasionally are not enough. Nobody knows what and where endless bureaucracy and delays in everything. Big surprise: on the way back to Athens August 25th 2008 departure 02:45 we had to do the check in with only 2 desks open for 250 passengers while the man on the desk was disappearing every 2 minutes or 3 to talk with colleagues and fool around. The flight was delayed because most of the passengers had not done the check in although been there 3 hours before. No duty free shop was open for travellers to spend their money. Overall impression: decent infrastructure average to law quality services.,2,0
casablanca-airport,A Belafkih,,Casablanca Airport is a huge surprise. I had expected something less fanciful only to meet a well run and neat airport. Clearing customs in a large bright room lit by natural sunlight is comforting. It is a little darker at baggage claim and the arrival hall is more sombre than the departure. There are some money changers and unfortunately along came the touts as well. The train station is right below the airport and train service is 1 train per hour into the city (30-40 mins). The International Departure Hall on the other hand is modern bright and spiffy and again clearing customs is a breeze. My only grouse - the check-in rows and customs are far apart so a fair bit of walking is involved. The gates are clearly marked and easy to get to and eateries and cafes are fairly easily located.,3,0
casablanca-airport,Simon Summers,,Reasonable airport seemed efficient clean and friendly. Arrived in the evening and had to wait over an hour for the last train to Casablanca- Voyageurs which was annoying and there was no early train which arrived in time for my return flight early in the morning so I was forced to spent the night in the airport! Plenty of guards made the place seem secure found a couple of soft mats on which I managed to get some rest. All procedures were smooth check-in passport control and boarding by bus.,,0
casablanca-airport,Wesley Sloat,,Although Royal Air Morac tries to make CMN appear as one the up to date modern connecting hubs it isn't quite there. With one 767 coming in from JFK it took more than an hour to get the whole group of passengers through. And when making a connection on the way out the waiting area isn't really up to date either. The airport is not non smoking and if you don't like to be swarmed by second hand smoke it makes it tough. The food choices again arent really up to good modern standards. But with hat said those are really the only negatives I can think of at CMN. Its got cool duty free shopping.,,0
casablanca-airport,Sibiry Traore,,In transit between flights from Bamako to Lyon and return. Overall a cosey airport fairly clean and with comfortable seats.

catania-airport,L Wood,United Kingdom,"Filthy chaotic poorly managed and miserable. Expected to queue at check-in/bag drop and that was only for 5 minutes but the queue for security had to be seen to be believed and made even worse by ignorant people trying to jump in the queue claiming they only had five minutes (but were then seen the other side drinking). It was then bedlam at the departure gate with two flights ""queuing"" at adjacent gates and incoherent announcements. Such an appalling end to a beautiful holiday. Airports should be clean there should be soap toilet paper and regular emptying of bins in toilets and proper organisation at security and departure gates all of which was sorely lacking at Catania.",,0
catania-airport,L Hatcher,United Kingdom,Have just come back from our first holiday in Sicily - arriving and departing from Catania. Arrived at Catania Airport this morning with 2 hours prior to departure time to be greeted with complete and utter chaos caused by overflow in the airport check in security queues. Average queue time of over 2.5 hours to get through airport security - queues of over 300 deep! People missing their flights and lots of friction between passengers due to queue jumping and lack of staff in managing the situation. We only managed to catch our flight as we stumbled across an alternative queue reserved for solo passengers. Situation not acceptable nor sustainable and the airport management seriously need to address this issue. Security staff looked incredibly weary and I would have concerns as to whether this affected their ability to perform the necessary security checks.,,0
catania-airport,E Rawlins,United Kingdom,We travelled during the busiest holiday period in August and this airport was completely inadequate and ill equipped to deal with it. There was no crowd management with long and disorganised queues at check in and security. People were pushing in and weaving in and out all the time. It was so bad that other passengers used their phones to film people cutting in the queues as evidence. There should have been more staff on duty and more desks open to deal with the crowds. Hardly ideal after a 2 and a half hour coach journey from the hotel. Also not enough toilets and very few meal options in the departure lounge plus not enough seating at our gate.,1,0
catania-airport,Colette Dunkley,United Kingdom,On arrival and departure I used the toilets they were the worst that I have ever used in any airport. There was no soap in dispensers.

catania-airport,P James,United Kingdom,What a dreadful place. Light and airy airport but shocking facilities and the VIP lounge is incredibly bad and nothing but a terrible rip off for those who have paid to upgrade. The VIP lounge is tiny the day I visited there was a surly girl on the desk making a private phone call who seemed most annoyed that I requested the Wi-fi password which then didn't work. A few packet of crisps and a tall glass fridge with three bottles of water and a handful of bottles of orange juice. That isn't what people pay VIP fees for. No alcohol and no food and two day old newspapers. The toilets in the VIP lounge were filthy and the toilet roll holder in the ladies isn't even next to the toilet. Someone had also been smoking in the loo. The bars and shops in the airport are incredibly expensive. You can't wait to get out of this place. Once you go through passport control there aren't enough seats for passengers waiting to board so people sit on the floors.,2,0
catania-airport,James Wyatt,United Kingdom,Spacious with lots of seats. Shops are of standard number and quality. The VIP lounge upstairs is clean and tidy. Small but with good view of the apron but the drinks selection is limited to soft drinks and no food other than some miserable crisps. 2 newspapers and a magazine and that was it.,3,0
catania-airport,P Rosario,Italy,New terminal is a nice spacious building with plenty of check-in desks and several security gates the queuing times are very low. Unfortunately there are no adequate seating facilities toilets are usually almost clean but not so easy to get to there are only a few shops and places to buy food that open quite late in the morning. Staff is not so friendly and speaks only Italian. Once passport control was closed and we had to wait a few moments for the policeman to open. Never had problems with the luggage though.,3,0
catania-airport,Melissa Pace,Malta,Have had the misfortune to visit this airport on several occasions and have to agree with other comments regarding the filthy state of the place lack of customer service and very limited options for purchasing a meal. Last night we travelled from Catania to Malta and as usual it was filthy dirty the check-in staff surly and the icing on the cake was that the runway was closed for 3 and a half hours (no reason given for this) we has to sit and wait for 5 interminable hours with everything closed - no shops or bars to break the monotony- really not what you expect at all.,1,0
catania-airport,Tony Spitale,Switzerland,New terminal same old problems: I was looking forward to arrive and depart from the newly opened airport terminal. It looks impressive from the outside but once you are inside it is dirty and badly maintained. Arrived on Swiss from Zurich. Even as we were the only flight at that moment baggage handlers needed over 45 minutes to get all the luggage out of on the carousel. Flight was early which led to the fact that no one was available to operate the passenger bridge. Had to wait on the plane for approximately 10 minutes. Long walk over to the rental-car-offices along the old terminal where beggars and strolling dogs have taken over. Departure - overcrowded departure area. Windows and public toilets dirty. Staff unfriendly and uninterested. The only thing that really worked was the air-conditioning in the building. Overpriced cafés and bars. Catania airport hasn't improved a bit it is still filthy overcrowded and chaotic.,1,0
catania-airport,G Calafiore,,As Sicily's busiest airport CTA was recently given a totally new terminal building: light airy and pleasant. The building itself is where the positives end. The facility is hopelessly inadequate. There are good dining options upstairs and they can be reached by an escalator at the very far south end of the terminal that is is you can make your way past the thronging check-in queues. Looking for the toilet? Back downstairs you go and through a labyrinthine corridor and you will find them but if they are not closed for cleaning they will be reduced to an unusable state. Once you make it past the interminable queue for the security check be sure to keep an eye on the one central FID. Announcements regarding delays or gate changes (for those flights lucky enough to be parked at a gate) simply do not exist. Seating and toilet facilities airside are extremely limited and you will almost certainly have to take a bus to your aircraft on a stand-off bay. If you are arriving be in no hurry to get to the baggage carousel; you will stare at it for what seems like an eternity before it starts to move and even then the delivery of luggage will be erratic. In true Italian fashion this new airport looks nice but simply does not work.,2,0
catania-airport,Simon Castleman,,If you want a nice building with service in the dark ages Catania is for you. Went to get a coffee - closed for 10 minutes while they mopped the floor you could have been served over the counter in the area not being mopped but clearly that option didn't occur to the staff. Decided to use the toilet - closed for 10 minutes while they cleaned the floor - so walked to the other end of the airport. Went to go through passport control - closed for 10 minutes (make that 30 but 10 minutes is Sicilian for a delay of indeterminate length) the reason being the departure lounge is only big enough for the passengers of one aircraft so they only let that many through passport control at once. Still not much point in getting to the departure lounge too early as there are minimal facilities that side anyway (toilet small duty free shop only good for non eec flights and a vending machine),,0
cebu-airport,D Brooks,Australia,"Used this airport 7 times in the last 3 years. Its a little dingy as a first impression. Its small and not enough seats and the seats available are metal and hard. The carpet needs replacing urgently. There are a couple of overpriced shops for gifts and food but nothing special. The route through from plane to outside is usually very quick and much less stressful than Manila. Departure tax was php550 and it was too much. I believe the amount has now increased substantially. At the end of this form it asks""would you recommend this Airport?"" Of course, there is no other!",4,1
cebu-airport,Andy Carlson,Turkey,"Cebu Mactan is one of the better airports I have used. The staff are pleasant in all situations that may arise and extremely helpful. I see derogatory comments on here about the cleanliness Cebu airport from English travelers, they should look at their own airports first before commenting, most airports in UK are filthy especially Heathrow. Cebu is one of the most pleasant travel experiences you could wish for after a long haul flight, or of course the beginning of one. I would agree there are a lack of restaurants but this is a comparatively small international airport that is gradually growing. ",9,1
cebu-airport,E Carew,Australia,"An excellent experience, with alighting from the aircraft through immigration, collecting my bag and proceeding through customs to a taxi outside taking less than 15 minutes. The only downside is that relatives and friends are made to wait outside in what can be hot and (in the rainy season) humid conditions, rather than the airconditioned terminal. A contract has been awarded for a new international terminal so whether that construction adversely affects the existing terminals remains to be seen. Overall a great experience: if only Melbourne and Sydney in Australia were like this! Consider using Cebu for international arrivals and departures instead of Manila if at all possible with flight schedules.",10,1
cebu-airport,S Howard,United Kingdom,Once again I arrived at the airport amazingly I love the fact that getting off the plane and picking up my luggage took approximately 10 minutes. Immigration is the same picking up the luggage is the same nothing has changed the sad thing is my partner has to wait outside the airport and isn't allow inside the airport. As I have mentioned before it is excellent to arrive. Now departures is an entirely different matter you have to go through two security checks pay the departure tax which I think is pretty disgusting especially since they have increased it from PHP550 to PHP750 and the Cathay Pacific Lounge is pretty awful with extremely limited food and drinks and very dated. The duty free shops is expensive there is only one souvenir shop with some sort of food (admittedly I have never eaten there) a small smoking bar the washroom facilities are pretty basic too. The departure lounge itself is extremely basic hard uncomfortable seats. I been told it is now in private hands yes I noticed some lick of paints and small constructions going on but not impress at all. I am really looking forward to the new Bohol airport opening soon as I spend most of my time in Bohol.,5,0
cebu-airport,P Tripcony,United Kingdom,I have been using cebu airport over many years as I travel from Cebu to Dumaguete City by way of land/ferry. It used to be chaotic in the old days but steadily and surely its getting better I went through the airport Dec 2014 Jan 2015 coming in is good no big crowds and it does not take long to get to the baggage pick up and main entrance (for those of you that get ripped off by taxis the fare to Cebu city center is P200). But the outward flight I was surprised at the check in area a few new shops a coffee shop which is welcomed and a few new souvenir type shops but still very limited for food. Have a meal before you get there! Staff are very good the porters for a small tip will do everything for you push your luggage and get you in the check out line - they are a great help and always cheerful. In short if you can avoid Manila do so as Manila airport is the worst. While Cebu is so quiet after a long haul flight and outside the taxi service and approach is managed well. If you are used to the Philippines you know how to be patient if you are new to it just show up and do not get agitated and keep smiling.,8,1
cebu-airport,R Clarke,Saudi Arabia,This Airport is supposed to be in the hands of a private company after they won a bidding to take it over but you would hardly think so as there are only cosmetic changes like a bit of paint and posters. I flew out of this airport recently and you have the same chaos at the x-ray machines just to get into the check-in area. There is even less seating than before in this area before you check in and you see people all over sitting on the floor waiting for the check-in counter to open. After check-in you have another x-ray machine with staff who really couldn't care. All the seating is still the same cold uninviting metal chairs. The toilets are still filthy and no maintenance on the one I visited. Its a small airport but this private operator is definitely not up to the mark in terms of making it a pleasant experience for passengers. The food stalls etc.. are very expensive for what you get so gave that a miss. The only saving grace was the free Wi-Fi that actually worked along with this airport being better than NAIA T1.,2,0
cebu-airport,S Howard,United Kingdom,As usual entering Cebu Airport is brilliant as it only took me less than 10 minutes from leaving Cathay Pacific to leaving the airport. However I made a mistake I was approached by a taxi driver and I ended up paying double the fare nobody warned me about this. Lounge at Cebu airport is OK but could be improved. Some changes seem to be happening it seem cleaner however the departure lounge is pretty awful. This time I am rewarding it a 7 5 as it is excellent in leaving the airport but this time I have rewarded an extra 2 point on leaving as I met a wonderful immigration officer and chatted about Cebu Airport. Next year they are set to improve the departure and extra shops and reckon it will be finish in 4 years.,7,0
cebu-airport,Lars Bosteen,Philippines,Both the domestic and international sections are adequate overall. I've been through this airport 8 times in the past year and it is generally a stress-free experience. It is clean the queues are usually not bad the security / customs / immigration / airline officials are polite and the air conditioning just about right for everyone (judging by the lack of people either fanning themselves or shivering). There are quite a few shops but they mostly sell the same things and travellers shouldn't rely on them for books magazines or puzzles. The smoking area in the check in area is fine but the one in the departure area is best avoided unless you're really desperate. There doesn't seem to be free wi-fi (or if there is it isn't working).,7,1
cebu-airport,S Howard,United Kingdom,I have written several reviews. It is a brilliant airport to use when you arrive particularly if you are a premium traveller. From the moment I landed and got through immigration and picked up my luggage it took 6 minutes (admittedly with the assistant of the fabulous Cathay Pacific staff who led me through to the immigration first). The only issue I have is my poor friend has to wait outside the building. On my return to Cebu after checking in very quickly and paying my departure tax of 550 peso (honestly where does the money go) and through to the Cathay Pacific VIP lounge not bad but no hot breakfast something they should consider though. Then through to departure waiting lounge luckily the wait was only 10 minutes but plastic seats. There is talk of a new airport with 5 star facilities but I been told it wont be ready until 2030. I given it a 5 as it is excellent in entering Cebu but no points in leaving as lack of facilities.,5,0
cebu-airport,S Amaya,Australia,Traveled from SIN and arrived at around 4am and had a connecting flight to Boracay 3 hours later - nowhere to sit useless wifi mosquitoes everywhere. One of my worst connections ever. The only good thing was the painless and quick passport check but that's it. Departure Quick security process and passport check the only thing I didn't like was the exit tax. Where is the tax money going? Definitely not to improve the airport.,2,0
cebu-airport,S Howard,United Kingdom,I arrived from London via Hong Kong and as I was flying business class the whole procedure from getting off the plane luggage and passport control took less than 15 minutes very impressive however I hated the idea that people who wish to meet their friends or families at airport including mine were made to wait outside the airport in all kind of weather to me that is like treating them like 2nd class citizen. Apart from that I love arriving at Cebu as I know I be out so quickly.,8,1
cebu-airport,S Howard,United Kingdom,Pleasantly surprised by the business lounge which is quite good for such a small and behind the time airport. However I do have several criticisms. 1: Why do I have to pay for departure tax as far as I am aware it only the Philippines that does this and I am not convinced that the money will go to improve the airport. 2: Lack of shops. 3: I would have thought there would be a better seats for business class and first class passenger again the departure terminal looks tired and unclean and the seats are not that comfortable either.,1,0
cebu-airport,H Grimes,United Kingdom,Cebu International Airport has changed a lot and for the better. It's small and efficient. Exiting the airport is smoother and hadn't been hassled anymore by airport staff asking for freebies and asserting to help with your luggage even if you don't want to mainly to ask for tips. It's quick and smoother so well done.,8,1
cebu-airport,S Howard,United Kingdom,I arrived at Cebu airport to leave for HKG and then onto London. (My last report was 3 weeks earlier on arrival this one is departing). The main part of the airport was buzzing and a nice selection of shops however once checking in I was so surprise that I had to pay departure tax and had no pesos on me luckily I had English money but I suspect I got rip off with the lousy exchange rates. Why on earth do I have to pay this departure tax wasn't happy about this at all. There is one restaurant at the departure lounge and it is very expensive had to sit in the large waiting area where the seats was dirty and very uncomfortable 3 hours of boredom no cheap drinks either.,,0
cebu-airport,S Howard,United Kingdom,This is the first report of me arriving in Cebu after a long flight from London to Hong Kong I was very please to get off the plane and find my luggage was already waiting and straight to passport and out all in 20 minutes however a little surprise how quite the airport was but had not realise that my friends were waiting for me outside the airport.,7,1
cebu-airport,Nicole Leech,Australia,The international departures terminal does not have much to offer some snack shops money change souvenirs and a restaurant none if which accept credit cards. The seats are not very comfortable. If you have to kill between flights I'd recommend going across the road to the Waterfront Hotel. From the front of the international departures building cross the road and walk up the stairs where you see the sign for the There is a restaurant in the lobby which is a more comfortable place to wait they accept credit card and provide access to free wifi.,1,0
cebu-airport,L Khong,Singapore,Small airport with very expensive duty free shops that only accepts USD. Not worth it to shop in there at all when you know you are obviously paying a premium. A lot of taxi touts once you step out of the airport. Airport is old and run down with nothing to shop in there. No cosmetics or alcohol duty free shops. Worst thing is that you have to pay an airport fee of PHP550. This is the only airport which I've been made to pay an airport fee for goodness knows what. There is also no wifi in this airport.,1,0
cebu-airport,Joris Van Vooren,Belgium,For a rather small but busy airport it's efficiently run. Friendly staff too expensive so called tax free shops extremely expensive to drink a beer after check in and security. More convenient then NAIA. Could use an upgrade but there seem to be plans to build a new import in nearby Cordova. Knowing how things go in Philippines this will probably be in 2025. Better to pay 550 pesos airport tax in Cebu then 750 pesos in Manila.,7,1
cebu-airport,P Newton,United Kingdom,Departures is the saddest and most horrible airport I have ever used. The lower bar has been re-set in my estimate. You have to pay PHP550 each 'extra tax' regardless of what you already paid in the ticket. Only one little duty free which I thought was overpriced there is a small store selling a few snacks one restaurant where they make it clear that they do not accept credit cards. Most people walk out when they see the prices. After much tinkering I did manage to get the free wifi working. Quite a shock after visiting such a lovely country.,1,0
cebu-airport,Aditya Shrivastava,Australia,Arrived on an evening flight from Manila that was delayed. All good on arrival luggage and disembarking quick. International departure was good. A little crowded as a couple of flights were leaving but through to check-in quickly. Staff at the Cathay desk were friendly and helpful. No long queues. Aerobridges always help as does a 747 with 3 seats to myself!,8,1
cebu-airport,J Agunias,Philippines,Look like the airport is stuck in the 1980s. Too brown and too dark the ambience is not appropriate for a city known for its beaches and clear skies. Fairly clean halls but the toilets need a little more scrubbing. Very few dining options. An upgrade or a new terminal must be in order.,7,1
cebu-airport,Jezrel Sabaduquia,United States,The airport is small so it's easy to navigate. Used the domestic area of the airport and it was a good experience. Check-In hall was old but very clean and spacious. Security was okay we had to pay the terminal fee as usual. Departure gates were rather spacious and cozy. The best part was the free internet and the computer stations! It was fast and I was able to go on facebook and check my emails. There were an ample amount of restaurants and shops and the staff was rather friendly. I much prefer Cebu than Manila it's small manageable and the experience is less stressful.,4,0
cebu-airport,Robert Haighton,Netherlands,Used Mactan-Cebu International Airport Sept 2nd 2010 close to 12 midday (incoming) and Sept 22 2010 and again around 12 midday (outgoing). Small yes but I liked that. Very few shops. After check in and passing customs and all that it was no problem of leaving airport building to smoke a ciggy. Plus be aware you have to pay PHP 550 on departure (airport tax?). What struck me most as odd that upon arrival there was no soul in arrivals. I've learned that in case you have no plane ticket you can not enter airport building. So those who will pick you up are outside the airport building waiting for you. On both occasions I did not experience any hassles.,4,0
cebu-airport,P Tomms,Australia,This is a nice small airport and arrival and departure managed in a breeze. Arrival with luggage through immigration and my greeting party in about 20 minutes from an international flight. Leaving is a bit more problematic as you check in and then come back through security but it works ok and staff are very friendly and helpful albeit it will cost you a tip.,5,0
cebu-airport,Oliver Maeder,,Used it 14 times within the last year twice internationally. The smallness of it is nice you are quick everywhere - international arrival/departure was swifter and nicer than Manila NAIA. Few shops. After check-in you can leave the terminal again to wait outside or in the restaurants.,4,0
cebu-airport,M Larson,,Decent for a smaller airport. After trying to navigate through larger airports for years I have learned to appreciate smallness in an airport. True not much selection for shopping but I don't go to an airport to shop. I really love the fact that its easy to get from one part of the terminal to the other. Once you clear customs you are right on the street where you can easily hail a taxi to take you into town. I have always had a soft spot in my heart for this place.,4,0
cebu-airport,Diala Sobh,,Cebu Airport is Okay as an airport but really very very small and gets very boring let alone the stuff you want to buy that are at least 10 times more expensive than in the city. I had to wait for 3 hours before boarding my flight to Manila we had to change our gate 2 times and it was the most boring time in my life.,3,0
cebu-airport,Mark Lokan,,First time experience at Cebu. We arrived by boat at 6am and went straight to the airport as we didnt have the funds to go roaming around we on our voyage home. It was disappointing we were not able to check in our bags and the atmosphere was like a deserted town everything just about closed. Seating uncomfortable also. Once check in opened for our flight it was a breeze going through. The next trip I had the best customer service I could get. Due to traffic we had arrived as the plane was boarding. They accepted me on the flight rushed my bags to the plane and rushed me through immigration. This would happen for a second time on next departure. Once again we was rushed to the plane and we departed for Malaysia. This displays great commitment to not leave anyone behind. Facilities of the airport are a little bit disappointing. There are no chain food restaurants at the airport and not much available after you have passed immigration. I would give 5 stars for the customer service but its let down by the actual airport. An upgrade is needed for potential expansion as I would prefer flying into Cebu rather than Manila as Cebu is peaceful and calm at the airport all it needs is an update.,4,0
cebu-airport,Edmund Carew,,Cebu is a more convenient and less hassled entry point to the Philippines than Manila. Taxi travel to and from Cebu's CBD is efficient aided by the two bridges in lieu of the former one connecting Mactan and Cebu islands. Provided one arrives on an airline like SilkAir that flies at off-peak times to Cebu immigration queues can be non-existent. However leaving can be a different story with a 20 minute queue to obtain entry to the checkin area and then a 25 minute wait in the mid afternoon through immigration. Cebu's beautiful resorts are popular with Koreans so make sure that the departure time of your flight does not coincide with flights to Seoul or Pusan - you will not be able to get to your gate in five minutes. The restricted entry to checkin is designed to stop hordes of well wishes from clogging checkin but it does add a delay not found in many other non- Filipino airports. There is a limited range of shops once through immigration and they do not stock basics like 'load' for a local cellphone - so come prepared with snacks if need be. It is possible once you have checked in to hand in your boarding pass and re-enter the 'outside world' but you do have to then queue to go through security to the checkin area so some may conclude it is not worth the hassle to bid a final goodbye to family friends or business associates.,4,0
cebu-airport,J Olfato,,Mactan airport is very okay but relatively small with less than 10 gates and looks like it has seen better days. Since Cebu tourism is booming at times the airport is overcrowded. No place to shop and eat apart from the souvenir shops and cheap donuts. Immigration was fast though and people are nice. The airport seems very laid back though which is good. Definitely better than Manila airport. Tip: on arrival go to the departure areas for a cab because the arrival coupon taxis are way more expensive.,4,0
cebu-airport,R Clarke,,This Airport especially late at night at the international departures is now overloaded with passengers taking flights that the queues have become horrendous both at the first security check before you get to the check in. The it takes 45 mins now just to clear immigration & another 15-20mins to go through another security check before you reach your gate. Now plans are in place to expand the international terminal & at this time of night its like a zoo. Don't bother buying from the Duty Free as the prices are sky high & you could have bought these cheaper in town.,2,0
cebu-airport,Frank Winter,,Totally agree with Dirk Visser. Really bad airport very dirty. Absolutely nothing to do after immigration (no shops very limited seats) so don't pass immigration too early. Only one shop with extremely limited selection. Don't plan to buy anything there you must be self sufficient until you get on the plane (bring your Ipod and your own water/food). Very surprising that the airport is still so sub- standard although so many tourists are going to Cebu (which is beautiful by the way). A pity. Might be better than Manila (haven't been to Manila in 4 years) but that does not say much.,,0
cebu-airport,Dirk Visser,,We flew into and out of Cebu-Mactan Airport in November of this year. We arrived quite late from HKG and had to wait quite a while for immigration to process our full flight together with a PAL flight from Japan. Luggage claim area was like stepping back in time....a bit dodgy but ok. Leave the terminal and you are literally bombarded left and right by taxi drivers and money exchangers. Leaving was a different story. The check-in desks for the international departures are behind doors that are kept locked until a few hours before departure which means you are sitting in a rather dingy terminal until your airline is ready to check you in. Security is a joke but that didn't surprise us after being in the Philippines. Once you check in you have the option of going through to the gate or back into the main terminal. We were told to go to immigration and were surprised with the fact that we had to pay an airport tax P 550 or $ 11. Once through passport control you are at the gates. There is ONE store: Phlilippes Duty Free (total rip- off and joke) and two cafeterias which were asking ridiculous amounts for everything on the menu. As the gate area was kept closed you wait in a huge area behind passport control just behind passport control. We had a laugh as we stood (there were only 5 chairs) behind the passport control people who were playing video games on their computers. That explains why they snarled at us when we arrived! We interrupted them!!!! Other than stand and wait you can be massaged by ladies that await you when you clear immigration who bother you even when you barely look in their direction. So for those travelling to this prison- turned-airport do not clear immigration too early as there is nothing to do! Facilities are way under par but being the Philippines it shouldn't come as a surprise.,,0
cebu-airport,Corey Shreffler,,"Mactan-Cebu International Airport (CEB) is a much better entry point to the Philippines than Ninoy Aquino (unless your final destination is Manila of course). However despite the fact that Cebu is the second-largest city in the Philippines there is nothing overly impressive about its airport. I arrived at CEB on a domestic flight and was quite surprised how desolate the terminal was. This was in stark contrast to what was waiting just outside. For a flight of 60 or so people it seemed like the whole city of Cebu was waiting to greet us in the ""welcoming area"". I stuck out like a sore thumb being the only Cacuasian around but never once felt threatened by the smiling faces of Filipinos. I was immediately greeted by a sonata of sales pitches as taxi reps competed for my business. I gently waved them off since I was waiting to meet my friend. They were persistent but not obnoxious. The availability of transportation is not a problem at CEB but you will need to learn the art of negotiation to avoid being charged unfairly. Thankfully my friend is quite skilled in these matters and we never had to pay an elevated fare. A few weeks later I left from the international terminal at CEB for a flight to HKG. I don't remember much about my actual impressions of this terminal since I was contemplating a heartbreaking goodbye to my friend. However I do remember that the security line was not long at all and the entire process of getting my boarding pass and clearing customs took about 15 minutes max. The airport workers were quite friendly except of course for the customs official. CEB is a utilitarian airport and nothing more. It helps you get around the Philippines and S.E. Asia but luxurious it is not. It does however have a much more friendly feel than NAIA and Manila's domestic terminal.",,0
cebu-airport,E Mallari,,This is a small international airport. The approach to the terminal is not very impressive. The food selection and stores outside the security check area have very few selections compared to other international airports of comparable size. Security check line is short and the process efficient. Once inside the terminal is bereft of quality food outlets. There are few stores that sell souvenirs and indigenous food items to take home. We stayed inside Philippine Airlines business class lounge so we avoided the large crowd outside. The public restrooms are not well maintained. To get inside the boarding area each passenger must pay an airport departure tax payable in cash. The boarding area is too small for the Airbus A330-300 that PAL uses for its Cebu-Manila flights.,,0
cebu-airport,Joseph Cal,,Airport of Cebu is very laid back style. But it makes me feel more convenient than to go Manila airport. There are 4 international airlines to choose from - Cathay Silk Air Malaysia Airlines and Qatar airways. Its hassle free airport and when it comes to transportation lots of taxi outside the airport. And two big hotel near the airport - Waterfront Mactan hotel and Days hotel.,,0
centrair-nagoya-airport,Jeremy Chan,Hong Kong,"I have never expected that a small-scale airport can be able to provide outstanding and extensive services to travellers. The airport was very clean and tidy, and everything in the terminal was well organised. Incredibly large number of facilities including an observation public bath. A wide choice of restaurants was available and the prices were reasonable. The sky deck was very large and great for phototaking. Airport signs were very clear and staff were always eager to help travellers. Convenient access to the city centre. The airport gave us a great impression upon our first visit to Nagoya.",10,1
centrair-nagoya-airport,M Rosener,United States,Connected through this airport with Delta. It seems slightly older and smaller than Narita. Passing through security was quick and painless. The place is clean and has an open and bright feeling. There are standard airport shopping opportunities if you are interested. The meal options seemed severely limited which would be my only real complaint however I believe it is a large complaint because airplane food is awful.,7,1
centrair-nagoya-airport,M Mejia,Philippines,Good small airport for a short transit. Not as big as NRT which makes it not as daunting. Small shopping selection but pretty good food. Efficient staff and quick security measures makes transit quite painless.,8,1
centrair-nagoya-airport,S Hedden,United States,I used Nagoya as a transit airport between Indonesia and USA. Quick arrival procedures. Everything was well signed in Japanese and English. Transfer desk was unmanned but I bypassed as I already had boarding pass for connecting flight. Security was fast and polite. Terminal was clean and orderly. My flight was delayed by 10 hours. Terminal has high ceilings and big windows looking out over ramp providing an open feeling. Clean restrooms. Only 1 restaurant which only takes Japanese Yen and a Starbucks but there are several money exchange booths. I did not find an ATM anywhere. Lots of duty-free and high-end shops but only one very poorly stocked news stand. Free Internet throughout airport both via wifi and several laptop stations with Ethernet power plugs chair and light. Lots of vending machines throughout but only take Yen.,8,1
centrair-nagoya-airport,D McKay,,We flew into Nagoya Airport with the intent of catching the bullet train to Tokyo. Definitely need more english signs in the transportation areas. We went on the train into Nagoya first went to the front nice and plenty of seats lots of smokers though; only to have one of the attendants come by and tell us to move as our tickets were the 'back of the train' areas. Wish we had known what to buy at the counter. By the time we walked all the way back through the moving train with all our luggage there were no seats so we had to split up. If we had known about the different seating sections we would have had seats in the beginning. Planning to go to Nagoya again in a few weeks so know from experience now what to do. Get the day train passes rather than try to figure out the 'yen' for each train ride. Get your yen changed in Japan not mainland as we know it is very low right now to the US dollar. Other than that we were a party of 3 and timed our train riding to when it wasn't rush hour.,4,0
centrair-nagoya-airport,A Hopper,,Nagoya Airport is an impressive building with a nice selection of shops and restaurants. However be prepared for excessive immigration queues fairly rude check-in staff and exceptionally brusque (indifferent at best) customs officers. Perhaps I just passed through on 2 occasions when everyone was having a bad day! Just don't expect much from the staff!,3,0
centrair-nagoya-airport,Andres Rodriguez,,If you have the benefit of arriving there you'll be pleased with the smooth flow of passport control and customs. Plenty of staff on hand to assist even some volunteers to help you when you come out of customs if you don't speak much Japanese. The local impeccable train network is a 5 min walk from customs where you can connect right into Nagoya city within 30minutes. Departing out of Centrair the fourth floor is full of interesting places to shop and eat. So much space in the airport it's spotless. Skydeck is a treat and favorite is the sento (Japanese public bath) right up there on the fourth floor.,5,0
centrair-nagoya-airport,Michael Henry,,I have been though the new Nagoya Airport a handful of times which took over from the old and tired Komaki airport. Overall it is much better than the old airport being clean and relatively spacious. There is a small food court with a limited selection of food (western and Japanese) as well as high brand stores. Staff are very polite and my experience through customs and immigration has been excellent. We did sometimes have to wait a while but we were treated very well by staff which is a highlight of customer service in Japan. The airport has frequent connections (every 15 mins) to Nagoya city via the dedicated Meitetsu airport train which is wonderful. Cost (one way) for the Limited Express (25 mins) is 1100 yen / $11 and the Express (35 mins) is 830 yen / $8. You have both premium cars and standard cars I would go for the premium since there are less people and the interior is very nice but the standard is fine though often crowded. A decent airport.,,0
centrair-nagoya-airport,T Neyrinck,,Nagoya Centrair (Chubu) has one fantastic characteristic that we almost never ever see anymore today: a great open-air rooftop deck allowing for great views on the tarmac and runways. The airport building itself is pleasant and has many food courts before security but only a handful of (very expensive) shops and one disappointing restaurant beyond security. The departure gates area is very clean and relaxing but boring except for the big windows to watch planes and enjoy the view of the bay . It takes about 45min (and 110 USD) by taxi from the airport to downtown Nagoya.,,0
centrair-nagoya-airport,Leigh Wighton,,The new Centrair airport is a vast improvement on the old Komaki airport which had all the charm of a bus-stop. However it's newness seems to be the only thing it has over the previous airport. It's design is almost exactly the same as Komaki's. The check-in and arrival areas are not that much bigger than Komaki's except there is a small shopping area and foodcourt upstairs. The shops in this area tend to be mostly high-end brand name vendors and the foodcourt is so small you can hardly ever get a seat there. In fact seating seems to be an issue in centrair. In the check-in area also there really aren't that many places to sit down and wait. This is different when you proceed through passport control and enter the departure area. It's huge and spacious. A lot of room here which is nice but it's also very empty. There are very few places to get food drinks or duty-free shopping. I had the over-all impression that perhaps the departure area of centrair is a bit too big. I was there during the christmas/new-year period yet there were hardly any flights leaving. Overall centrair is a good clean and spacious(on the departure side) airport. No problems with check-in arrival and baggage claim. It still feels a bit utilitarian though. Despite being new it's only a slight improvement. After using Komaki several times I was looking forward to a new and improved Nagoya airport. Centrair is an improvement but not much of one I'm afraid. I've never used Kansai yet but all the airports I've used in Japan to date tend to be no more than a place to check-in and simply just wait for your flight. Nothing more nothing less. Centrair is no different really. In the future I'll stick to Narita as it 's a similar distance for me to travel to.,,0
centrair-nagoya-airport,Justin Dart,,Centrair is an amazing airport and far better than the old Nagoya airport. The airport's access to downtown is very efficient and convenient but lacks enough foreign language staff to help foreigners in need. Centrair's top floor is divided into a Japanese and Western areas. the Japanese side sells local foods and products. The Western side has a wide variety of restaurants ranging from French to Korean. Shops range from last minute to luxury. One of its great options is a Japanese Hot Spring bath - but the wait time is close to 1.5 hours. The departure area is very clean and relaxing but lacks small shops or cafes for getting that last minute thing. The DFS is all luxury goods and lacks local products. Luckily it has nice big windows to watch planes come and go and enjoy the view of the bay. The departure area has multiple internet connection tables but require users to be members of certain providers. Several locations are wireless and free for everyone. Transfering between International and Domestic is a simple walk after going through customs. Chubu International Airport is a great place and in my opinion better than Narita for convenience to a downtown area and better than Kansai for ease of use and shopping. This airport is a destination all its own.,,0
centrair-nagoya-airport,Car Pieper,,"Current Nagoya Airport is just clean. That's all. All of facilities shops and staffs are filled with so many problems. I am Japanese so it's no problem. But as for passengers from outside countries it is big PROBLEM and big HEADACHE. The first when you get off the airplane immigration tests your patience. (almost every ""foreigner"" looks like complaint obviously) they immigration staffs speak worse English with grumpy face. The second when you go out of airport for transportation Far less English signs are waiting for you. Mentioning to departure in the common area there are few food shops and shopping stores - bad and expensive. Besides All goods of them is for Japanese. According to the government and Nagoya local government Next year 2005 they will complete to architect ""New Nagoya Airport (We call 'New Chubu Int'l Airport') "" at the seashore in Tokoname town. To be physically far from the Nagoya center - it is no doubt. Probably as the same as Narita and Kansai new airport will put facilities food shops and immigration staffs who speak worse English. This is the very nightmare. Awful. Terrible.",,0
chambery-airport,A Marshall,United Kingdom,A terrible airport. Nowhere near enough facilities staff or processes to cope with the peak demand. An awful experience which ruined the holiday. Snow on runway caused major delays and backed up flights in UK - in the Alps? In the winter? Why should this have been a surprise? Limited snow clearing equipment. This airport should not be allowed to operate as a tourist airport for high volume of ski flights. Staff flustered passengers under pressure and tempers flaring. A horrible horrible experience but one for which there is little alternative choice with Crystal Ski to the Mont Blanc area. Unfortunately - same airport destination already booked for next year (prior to this horrific experience). 4.5 hours in slow moving road traffic to arrive at airport for 10 hour delay with what seemed like thousands and thousands of other similarly angry people. Read many reviews since which all give similar warnings over a long period of time - what do we have to say differently to prompt some dignified changes to this facility's operation? Avoid if you can.,,0
chambery-airport,Ian Banks,United Kingdom,This is by far the worst airport experience I have ever had. I have travelled extensively to some pretty remote places but this one is by far the worst. 1 hour queue to check in with no more than 10 parties in front of us. When we got there he had no record of our ski equipment been booked for carriage though I showed him the document which plainly showed it had so he had to call his supervisor. The check in itself was makeshift with half a dozen tee shirt clad youths throwing bags onto trolleys once finally checked in. Then another queue for security. Few trays to put things in when you got to the departure area (4 gates) it was completely full. I suspect there were at least a thousand people in a room designed for 200. When we arrived we had to circle for 30 minutes as there was no where to put us. There are tent like structures all around the terminal building serving as arrival security baggage halls etc. the main issue seems to be greed in that they are taking far more flights than the airport can handle. Avoid at all costs.,,0
chambery-airport,B Hickling,United Kingdom,Chambery Airport is a disgrace! Every flight in and out delayed by 1 hour. Very limited seating very poor services (1 restaurant and snack bar). The departure lounge is just one big room (with 4 so called departure gates) where all different flight passengers just stand around mixed in hoping to be near their gate - utter chaos. Avoid using Chambery Airport at all cost - go somewhere different and if skiing in La Plagne/Les Arc area use Geneva airport. This airport just cannot cope with more than a few planes a day!,,0
chambery-airport,N Renouf,United Kingdom,A total disaster which spoiled the holiday. Wildly over congested seating very limited and passengers sleeping all over the floor. Flight information on two screens only horrific queues for check in and immigration. Avoid at all costs and the extra transfer time from Grenoble Geneva etc more than makes up for the horrible experience that is Chambery.,,0
chambery-airport,P Duquemin,,Terribly congested airport especially ski resort changeover delays. Always delays as only limited capacity for airliners in landing parking weight restrictions etc. Cant find seats no room to sit on floors litter everywhere toilets overflowing with urine no proper information and facilities unable to cope. A usual Saturday experience according to our Crystal rep. This airport is a health and safety disaster. Travel companies should put pressure on Chambery authorities to expand and improve facilities. Until then use elsewhere - Grenoble Lyons or Geneva or try other countries as it is a horrible experience.,1,0
chambery-airport,Rob Weeks,,Extremely congested during the arrival and departure of weekend ski flights. Neither the arrivals area nor the departures area are physically big enough to cater for the number of customers trying to get through. Very subject to weather delays: day before we arrived most flights were diverted to Grenoble. We were processed (!) efficiently in both directions and will probably use the airport again due to the shorter transfer times to resorts than from GVA or LYS.,3,0
chambery-airport,David Grey,,Small airport at the base of the French Alps catering mainly for British skiing flights during the winter season. Facilities very limited; 4 check-in desks that don't necessarily have signs telling which flight they are checking in cafe/lounge/viewing area land-side small snack bar + duty free shop air-side one baggage belt for arrivals. No problems for either of my flights (arrive Thursday lunchtime depart Sunday lunchtime) but apparently the airport can get very congested during peak periods.,,0
changzhou-airport,A Yeraliyev,Kazakhstan,CZX is a small domestic airport (however a new big terminal is being constructed nearby) with basic facilities (and no milk at a coffee shop). Efficient check-in although boarding is little disorganized as you have to walk to the airplane. Not much to do apart from couple of souvenir and grocery/travel stuff stores airside; there is a smoking room and a lighter can be obtained from the next door coffee shop attendant :) as they will make you remove matches and lighters before allowing to an airside lounge. The airport is quite a drive away from the city. No queues as there were only two flights departing when I was there.,3,0
chania-airport,R King,United Kingdom,The worst airport I have ever experienced. We arrived two hours before our flight which we assumed would be ample time but alarm bells began to ring when we saw massive queues everywhere both outside and inside the terminal. When we found the check in desk although the queue was not that long the check in person took a ridiculous amount of time to deal with each party so it took ages to reach the front of the queue. We then discovered that we had to join another queue to have the bags x- rayed! After that we queued again to get through security and this was a free for all with no system at all and the staff again were really slow and didn't seem to care at all. By the time we finally reached the gate the whole process had taken over one and a half hours! Had we arrived at the airport much later we easily could have missed our flight altogether! The airport clearly neither has the staff nor the capacity to deal with the amount of traffic it receives and is a shambles more akin to airports of the 1960's. This experience means we are very unlikely to ever visit Crete again and this is a shame as the island has much to offer. Since the island is very much tourist dependent the authorities need to get a grip on this problem as it is a disgrace.,,0
chania-airport,H Gibbs,Netherlands,"Arriving from Amsterdam the baggage arrived quickly. Very long queues even outside waiting to depart interfering with arriving passengers. Departing from Chania: We arrived in good time to avoid this. We appreciated the nice air-conditioning in the departure hall and lounge after a long hot car journey. The toilets are in need of an overhaul broken seats WC roll holders tiles etc. You have to carry you hold luggage from check-in to security. Before security a big bottle of water costs 50 c After security in the bar 1.50 Euro. The monitors with information all worked. The holding bar was adequate. ""Tax-free"" shop and bar expensive. This airport is better than Heraklion airport when we were there last year.",6,1
chania-airport,V Athanasakis,Greece,Nice small airport for winter chaotic during summer. Long waiting for baggage screening. Not many stores expensive bar toilets below standards limited signage far from city without extensive bus routes. Arrival area very dark light bulbs burned out airport information desk clueless. Needs improvements very fast.,3,0
charlotte-airport,William Campbell,United States,"My wife and I were attending an Army reunion at Madison WI. Trip to Madison was good, but on the return flight into Charlotte the requested mobile transport for my wife was not at the gate and approximately 30 minutes were wasted trying to procure transport to get to the gate by boarding time. The driver explained that his cart broke down and that he checked 3 others which were not serviceable. We had to change to another cart as they cannot change floors. On the lower level, the employee scanned in the wrong flight and gate and my wife caught it before we left, very poor management on having serviceable transport available as well as employee who can operate a scanner. The connecting flight from Charlotte to Columbia (CAE) is not worth the effort with far too much time wasted on the ground, boarding, taxiing and deplaning and no space on the small ""puddle jumper"" aircraft for standard carry on luggage. Next time we use the Columbia shuttle service.",5,1
charlotte-airport,David Greer,Germany,"Distance from car rental area to check-in isn´t that far compared to other US airports. TSA is a story of it´s own. Not the airport administrations fault! Be prepared to walk a few minutes to get to your gate, but it helps to burn some calories. I rate it as one of the best in the eastern US.",10,1
charlotte-airport,G Sears,United States,"Where to even start. So they installed machines in the arrival area, presumably to get arriving US citizens through immigration faster. Or so you would think. Instead, they actually added those machines as an additional step to hassle incoming passengers, because after queuing for half an hour for the machines you will then be made to queue again to see an agent. If you have the misfortune to be a permanent resident in this country, they will now take your fingerprints and your photo twice. Yes, both at the machines and at the officer's. Of course they then also ask you what you want in the USA. The whole process is ridiculously inefficient, the staff are unfriendly and unhelpful, both visitors and citizens/residents of this country are treated like criminals. The worst experience at any airport.",1,0
charlotte-airport,E Dong,United States,I have to go to this airport every time I need to fly somewhere and it's such a hassle. The staff and employees are very unfriendly and unhelpful and they assist people with the fewest words possible. Most staff don't look like they enjoy their jobs. Checking in is especially a hassle. They don't care if you miss your flight or not. The airport itself isn't too clean either. The signs are sometimes confusing as well.,2,0
charlotte-airport,L Thornburg,United States,What a nice airport. Can get international flights but not huge and crazy like DC or Atlanta. Lots of facilities and they have old fashioned rocking chairs in the terminal area-nice touch. Also have attendants in the restrooms-also a nice touch. Only negative is their intercom system. Hard to tell which gate desk the announcements are from and hard to hear some clearly.,10,1
charlotte-airport,E Hintz,United States,The airport is very busy and does a very good job moving travelers. But the U.S. Customs Service is the very worst of several ports of entry we have been thru. The staff are not well informed uniformly rude and insulting. Overall an extremely poor impression for foreign visitors.,5,0
charlotte-airport,T Shaw,United States,CLT-their directional parking signage is directionless! They should be ashamed of themselves! Had a 7 am flight to SFO and circled your airport three times following your LT parking signs only to find no parking lots. If I had an airport facility saturated in construction chaos I would have employees out in the open to direct traffic and answer questions. If anyone is thinking about flying out of CLT during the upcoming holidays my advice is don't!,,0
charlotte-airport,Sam Comfort,United States,Charlotte is a busy airport - a hub for US Airways - and TSA lines there can be tough. There are - when all areas are open - five TSA lines so check out other lines if the middle ones are full. Once inside the airport has pretty good amenities - massage and decent fast food. US Air club is very nice one of the best in the USA. Outside there is a lot of construction. The Hertz rental car center is atrocious - very long lines in May. Attendants in men's room is a lost occupation but does exist here. Stopping off at the men's room is usually a nightmare in most airports. Full time attendant makes it much cleaner. Overall this very busy airport has more southern charm than say Atlanta Hartsfield. For those renting cars the local highways are atrociously under- signed. Often there is one sign and when you look around for more guidance there's nothing. Charlotte NC and NCDOT need to do a much better job in adding signs: Those of us renting cars are new to the area and we will get lost. Most major cities do a far better job of communicating the airport's location with adequate signs.,8,1
charlotte-airport,M Whyte,United States,This review is strictly about customs and immigration. They turned what used to be a simple process into the biggest cluster I have ever seen. First you enter a cavernous room at one end. Then you queue up at the other end. You go through multiple twists and turns with hundreds of others until you reach a kiosk. A person barks at you when the next kiosk is available. Then you are left on your own to figure out the purpose of the kiosk. Once you follow a series of instructions it takes your picture. Then you have to redo the steps for each person in your group. Lastly your are funnelled into another queue to meet with a customs agent to stamp your passport. Once out of line you pick up your bags recheck them go through security again and hope you make your connection on time. This entire process from stepping on US soil to going through security again took around 50 minutes. And this was a Monday night. Ridiculous.,,0
charlotte-airport,M Dion,United States,I arrived to Charlotte Airport on my connection to Atlanta. Aircraft had to wait about 20 minutes on the taxiway before going to the gate. Airport was very congested and not maintained. People were standing everywhere and gate change was done last minute. Terminal and gates were very unorganized. Everyone at the gate wanted to charge their phone but plugs were very limited and some were not working.,2,0
charlotte-airport,E Krause,United States,Going through Customs in Charlotte was horrible. Long lines. Very few employees. One employee in particular was rude and obnoxious. I have been through Customs many other places including London a week ago...all were a breeze to get through. Charlotte also used to be easy. What has happened?,2,0
charlotte-airport,J Oriole,United States,Living in Philadelphia I always feel annoyed that I have to change flights at CLT to get to almost anywhere in Latin America on US Airways. That said it's very convenient if your flight arrives at concourse D (a number of PHL-CLT flights arrive at concourse D as they continue on to international destinations) as all international flights depart from concourse D and it's very convenient. If your flight arrives at any other concourse expect a really long walk. However my latest arrival at CLT was anything but convenient. There's a lot of construction going on in the customs and immigration area and confusion reigns with even the staff not really understanding where anything is. The Global Entry kiosks are still right at the entrance to the hall but for some inexplicable reason instead of letting Global Entry passengers exit through the lane closest to the kiosks they are now directed to join the huge line of passengers waiting for the other lanes and then directed all the way to the other side of the hall where the exit for Global Entry is covered in black plastic. After pointlessly waiting over half an hour to exit the scene in the baggage claim and customs area was just as chaotic. After finally emerging from customs and directly into the baggage re-check-in area I totally forgot that I needed to check in the two bottles of wine I had purchased in duty free before I rechecked my suitcase. Luckily I hadn't got too far but by the time I returned to the counter my suitcase had already disappeared into the bowels of the airport so I then needed to check in my carry on bag with my wine. What an absolute mess of an airport.,3,0
charlotte-airport,T May,United States,Not a half-bad airport definitely the superior US Airways hub in comparison to Philadelphia. It's very clean nicely signed everywhere and the workers generally have good attitudes. However it would seem the runway layout may have some issues and when it was raining yesterday everything fell through by a bit. A shuttle would be good as well. Overall I'd fly again but I'd give myself more time in case something goes wrong since they aren't as quick to fix errors like some other airports I've been to.,8,1
charlotte-airport,S Tomblin,United States,We recently flew from Charlotte NC to Chicago IL on June 7 2013. I had never flown before but my husband had on several occasions so he knew what to do. The screening process only took a matter of minutes. We did end up having to wait for quite a while because there was bad weather outside causing our plane to arrive late. We didn't have any problems with the staff or with the facilities. Anything we needed was readily available.,10,1
charlotte-airport,J Kadri,United States,I flew through CLT many times in the past and never really had anything positive or negative to say about it. However a recent experience helped to define my opinion of the airport. I flew US from PUJ to MIA via CLT which meant clearing immigration and customs in CLT. I must say that CLT is the most efficient airport I've ever seen in my life of traveling and I've traveled to some of the largest and most reputable airports in the world. From disembarking to claiming luggage immigration customs and going through security it was all literally a matter of 20 minutes give or take. I'd like to see any airport in the United States come anywhere close to that. Customs and immigration officers for international arrivals were friendly and cheerful. TSA were also surprisingly very polite and helpful too. Shopping and food choices are unbelievable not even JFK has such a selection. If ever I have to connect planes anywhere in the United States CLT is my #1 choice!,10,1
charlotte-airport,J Schyberg,United States,Ok airport however the parking situation is a mess. Can take up to an hour to get either long and short term lots.,5,1
charlotte-airport,P Servaes,United States,Worst TSA in the Nation - security line 57 minutes long - no consideration foot the fact they make dozens of people miss their flights - over 100 first class passenger skipped the line during that time with no thought to the coach folks who missed their flights as a result.,,0
charlotte-airport,Dick Hobbs,United Kingdom,Charlotte is a brilliant airport for arriving international passengers. Polite immigration officers simple customs formalities in-line baggage recheck and virtually no line for TSA to get back airside. And there is an excellent wine tasting bar with good food in the terminal.,9,1
charlotte-airport,S Koenig,Brazil,Smaller and more compact than other airports we've used for international-domestic connections. Immigration and customs processes were quick. Needed a new belt and got one in a store that was open early just as we re-entered the terminal area for our connection. Only clubs are US Airways clubs which do not have showers but which are large. Gate areas can be very crowded for some flights.,8,1
charlotte-airport,Peta Cook,United Kingdom,Possibly the loveliest airport I have been to in my last 12 months of travelling around the world! Unfortunately I had to wait 5 hours for a connecting flight but felt fortunate enough to be in Charlotte Douglas doing so. The staff were all extremely courteous helpful and friendly; there were plenty of eateries and the rocking chairs piano player and giant aeroplane mobile were lovely touches - all very unexpected! I spent at least an hour rocking in one of the chairs using the free WiFi and reading my book.,9,1
charlotte-airport,John Elkine,United States,Quite possibly the worst travel experience ever. 4 security lines only 1 open because of TSA staffing issues. US Air rep gave me the wrong ticket causing me to miss my flight. None of the gate destination boards were working so they all had the wrong city names on them. I will definitely fly around Charlotte in the future. By the way when did they start allowing pan handling in the airport restrooms? I don't want to feel obligated to tip a uniformed personnel for getting me a paper towel to dry my hands.,1,0
charlotte-airport,S Jabara,United States,I got through the immigration line in less than 10 minutes! Yes you have to claim your luggage and then recheck it but it was hassle free. Now the line to go through security was ridiculously long but it moved relatively fast. Overall I was very pleased with this airport.,9,1
charlotte-airport,B Hyatt,United States,I flew into Charlotte airport from Rome and had a layover in Charlotte on the way to Greensboro NC. First the International flight procedures were really confusing. You have pick up your checked luggage carry about 10 feet and recheck it. Very pointless. Also I've never been treated so poorly in any airport in my life. They rudely yell commands at you. They are very unorganized and blame it on the customers. I had my passport thrown back in my face at passport control/customs. Overall I was very disappointed with my experience.,1,0
charlotte-airport,Mark Gleisner,United States,If you are booking an International Flight don't even consider going through Charlotte. They do not have enough employees to handle the volume of people. We landed there from the Cayman Islands. The line for immigration was over 90 minutes. We had to run to our connecting flight. Arrived in Milwaukee missing a bag that was left in Charlotte.,2,0
charlotte-airport,S Koenig,Brazil,Decent airport. No big complaints other than as usual inadequate space in front of the terminals for the large number of cars that drop off passengers. There should also be monitors showing flight status that are visible from the food court areas. A dearth of airline clubs - just US Airways I believe - but there are at least three of those. I found the signs giving directions within the terminals a bit confusing.,7,1
charlotte-airport,S Srinivasan,United States,For the most part CLT is a pretty run-of-the-mill domestic hub airport. However there are two things that really stand out. The first is the good selection of locally themed restaurants. The second are the rocking chairs under shade trees in the main terminal area complete with power ports (the free WiFi is an added bonus - if only they had more of the rocking chairs because finding an open one can be difficult). You definitely get the feeling of being home in North Carolina while transiting through the airport.,7,1
charlotte-airport,Matthew Whitley,United States,The sound system is terrible. The airport needs to seriously rethink the acoustics in the terminal as messages from gates are too loud and can be heard from gates away. The sound engineering needs a lot of work.,8,1
charlotte-airport,D Hobbs,United Kingdom,Transiting from London and to Washington DCA was a delight. A large number of immigration officers at their desks waiting for us to get off the plane courteous and friendly staff two people in front of me at the security check to get back into the airport. The terminal is adequate with the usual selection of shops and cafes. By far the best arrival experience I have had in the USA for decades.,10,1
charlotte-airport,S Koenig,Brazil,Transited twice during recent trip - once on international to domestic and once domestic to international. Former went smoothly. I was worried our 2+ hr connection would be sufficient but Immigration and Customs were very quick processes and we didn't have to wait too long for our bags to arrive. On the return we were on a small plane (Dash-8) from GSP. As expected some of the larger carry-on bags were taken from us and put in the baggage hold and given tags to retrieve the bags upon landing. Upon arrival the unloading of bags on the tarmac seemed to take a long time and when a thunderstorm approached we all had to go inside. Finally the workers were allowed to get our bags and gradually put them in the terminal where we waited. The airport is quite big and can take a while to traverse with somewhat confusing signage though certainly nothing like some other airports such as ATL. Managed to find the larger of the two US Airways clubs so we were out of the crowds until it came time to board our next flight.,3,0
charlotte-airport,Jezrel Sabaduquia,United States,Transferred from a US flight to another US flight. My flight from FLL arrived at the B concourse and I had to transfer to the C concourse for my flight to LGA. It was the evening rush hour and it was very crowded. Transfer was painless with the moving walkways. The selection of restaurants and shops is excellent lots to choose from. The gate area was rather cramped and the ceilings were dilapidated as well as the windows were dirty. Overall a great airport with friendly staff not the best one but it was a good experience.,4,0
charlotte-airport,A Roy,United States,"My wife just arrived at CLT with two small children enroute to PHX from PLS. The flight was 30 mins late. Customs took 2 hrs. She missed her connection. She asked if there were any special processing lines for small children like in MIA. The response ""get into the back of the line like everyone else"". Great treatment for a 5 yr old. Everyone in the airport and US Airways were rude and unhelpful. Avoid at all costs. We will continue to fly American through MIA.",1,0
charlotte-airport,D Lemay,United States,While returning to Charlotte after a nice vacation we found we had a dead battery. There is an airport service that will help you with problems such as this we told the ticket attendant she radioed the service and within a few minutes he was there to boost our battery at no charge. Thanks Charlotte Too bad more people don't know that you offer such a service.,5,0
charlotte-airport,G Gee,United States,This was our first experience with the Charlotte airport having always used JFK or Atlanta what a pleasant difference CLT offers. Clean uncrowded (on a Saturday depart and Sunday return) and all staff being very friendly. Security check was quick polite and efficient. All in all the whole experience was very civilised and we would highly recommend this airport.,5,0
charlotte-airport,S DePenning,United States,There is very little to make this otherwise nondescript airport stand out except for one unique redeeming quality: the availability of free wireless internet. When I used this airport a couple of years ago to visit family I regretted not having brought my laptop.,4,0
charlotte-airport,S Koenig,Brazil,We transited CLT twice: going from Rio to San Francisco and going from Washington DC to Rio. Going through Immigration and Customs was a snap. There were plenty of shops and restaurants but we spent out waiting time in the larger US Airways club (sure wish they had showers). We didn't see much of the airport but all in all it seemed clean modern and relatively easy to navigate (less chaotic than say Atlanta Hartsfield).,4,0
charlotte-airport,Kurt Mueller,Germany,"The main building with check-in counters is easy to negotiate landside. You can hardly have the check-in counters closer to the entrance doors than here. Once airside though long walks await the traveler. Security is strange with male pax asked to remove their sweatshirts (not females though wonder why). First time this has happened to me anywhere in the world and I can understand the public support for an anti-TSA demonstration prior to Thanksgiving. More curiosity at the ""Carolina Beer Co."" restaurant where the waiter asked to see my ID after ordering a beer. When I presented my driving licence he refused this as ""it was from out of state"" and asked for my passport instead. He accepted it although it was most definitely ""out of state"". When I enquired as to what this fuss was all about I was informed that they had orders to check the age of patrons to make sure there was no underage drinking. Laudable cause indeed - but one would think they would be able to recognize the absence of any potential problem without resorting to checking IDs when a traveler is like me 50+ years old. WiFi is free at this airport.",3,0
charlotte-airport,Mary Anne Allwein,,We arrived at CLT on Saturday evening at 6:30 pm from Cancun - only four immigration officers (out of nine stations) working at a time when several hundred passengers were in line to have their passports stamped. We had a two hour layover between flights and barely made our connecting flight. If that wasn't bad enough after passing immigration retrieving our bags and going through customs then rechecking our bags - we spent another 20 minutes getting through security again. They seemed to be experimenting with the new full body scanner and the process was not working correctly having to rescan a child several times in addition to wanding him. This makes no sense whatsoever. Situations like this backed up security at a time when passengers were trying to get to their next flights. One of the security employees even announced that security is not related to immigration and customs -basically saying it wasn't the TSA fault that immigration was so slow. We certainly understand the need for these protections but they must work more efficiently. The flights are scheduled well in advance why not have sufficient officers working to handle the passengers.,3,0
charlotte-airport,S Garac,,I used this airport for my holidays in the USA I was transiting through Charlotte. For me the positive point is that they were no big queue for admittance in the USA making it easy. After collecting bags I just have to let them in the xray and it was finished. As I got 4 hours transit I went in the city of Charlotte which is quite nice for transiting. WHen I went back to the airport I found controls ok but I found the airport style a little bit old fashioned. Anyway it's a nice airport.,4,0
charlotte-airport,A Toth,,I have connected through Charlotte many times for both domestic and international flights. We are always happy to go through this airport. Immigration/Customs efficient and the one time we ended up getting in late and missing our connecting flight we were given a decent voucher for food while waiting for a later flight home to PIT. Staff are friendly and helpful and there are lots of food choices.,4,0
charlotte-airport,S Slater,,I dread Atlanta and avoid at all costs. Charlotte makes for a wonderful alternative and the US Airways ground staff are informative and hospitable.,5,0
charlotte-airport,Monique Jones,,I travel for a living and connect through Charlotte at least twice a month and guess I just have bad luck? I fly from Raleigh which should be a thirty minute flight max but for some reason we always get grounded due to air traffic and the flight seems to now take an hour and a half. I've had to run through this airport countless times and since there's no rapid transportation going from the A terminal to the E terminal can be hell. And once I catch my connection taking off takes forever. However the free Wi-Fi is lovely and I always appreciate airports with Chili's!,3,0
charlotte-airport,S Egan,,Unlike the other reviewers here we had a very bad experience that might be specific to certain days of the week at CLT and/or elsewhere. We arrived in CLT on a Saturday from Mexico and went through customs around 6 pm. At that point there were maybe 2 planes full of people ahead of us and only 6 customs officers screening people. It took well over an hour for us to get through customs. While waiting 3 additional flights arrived and were queued behind us. We heard later that it took many people over 2 hours to get through and that many missed connecting flights as a result. What makes this experience especially unfortunate is that it is really unnecessary: a TSA agent told us that this is a recurring situation on Saturday nights - which means the Dept. of Homeland Security at Charlotte could have planned ahead knowing the number of international flights coming in on weekends. Instead it appears they assigned more people to herd us and/or tell people to put away cellphones and cameras than there were US customs agents. Signage in the airport is mediocre at best requiring people to direct travelers at times. On the positive side we found the selection of restaurants to be excellent and the airport clean and modern-looking.,2,0
charlotte-airport,G McGowan,,CLT is compact well-signed easy to navigate and most importantly-not overcrowded. Only negative- my flight waited on the tarmac for 15-20 minutes for a gate to become available (not sure whether or not this occurrs frequently). Excellent alternative to transiting through Atlanta.,4,0
charlotte-airport,Tony Tosca,,"Chic and comfortable. I didn't notice any decent restaurants - all they seem to have is fast food. But if there's one major complaint I have is this: how could you call yourselves an ""international"" airport and don't have facilities dedicated for currency exchange! And don't direct me to the bank - it was closed. Driving out of the airport was a nightmare but I will allow that traffic that particular day or time may just happened to be awful. Fix those little items and CLT is one of the best airports in the country.",4,0
charlotte-airport,P Guidali,,Arrived to CLT from Munich the immigration was so fast that I have been waiting for luggage 10 minutes. Then everything was easy and fast to get a car. For sure a good entry point for that area of the US.,4,0
charlotte-airport,P Littlefair,,Any US airport that can get a UK citizen travelling in Y class into a rental car and on the Interstate in under an hour from touchdown gets my vote. CLT was presentable and not too crowded. Immigration and all other staff were friendly with the possible exception of the Hertz desk clerk who was a bit curt. I agree with the comment about car return but computer routing to/from the West always seems to take you down Little Rock Road which is a bit of a tradesman’s entrance thus not well signed rather than the more official Interstate route. Be warned!,5,0
charlotte-airport,J Edvardsson,,I agree with the other reviewers about the Charlotte airport. It's a gem once you get inside. However if you are returning with a rental car I suggest you give yourself plenty of time. The rental return signage is the worst I've seen in 20 years of air travel. I've been there 5 times and it still takes me a extra time (and a u-turn or two) to find the rental car lot (I use Hertz but they all have the same problem). If you're an airport manager or city planner for Charlotte please see what you can do to improve this one glaring defect. Oh and by the way this Hertz airport rental operation is not the smoothest either. They use one or two big shuttle buses so the wait for a pick-up can be long. On the inbound they didn't have my car ready for me although my arrival was on time (and they forgot the nav system). On the return the bus driver almost ran over me when I tried to board the bus. I'm not kidding. Happy travels.,2,0
charlotte-airport,Robert Clark,,CLT is a very nice airport with an easy-to-understand approach. It is also the airport of choice if you are supposed to be heading to any location in South Carolina like CAE (Columbia) or GSP (Greenville- Spartanburg). Taking that next leg is quite expensive so land at CLT and rent a vehicle. The parking garage is simple and very close to the main building. I'd recommend CLT as a good portcall for anyone entering the USA as their customs are efficient.,,0
charlotte-airport,Jon Burgon,,I have connected through SFO LAX EWR MIA BOS etc etc and this was my first time in North Carolina. I have to say this little gem wins hands down every time. More akin to a European hub than the hellholes of Los Angeles and Boston and especially user friendly if you have children. Plenty of shops and things for kids to look at and do and just a general feeling of Southern Friendliness Id go back anytime! Definitely doing something right!,,0
charlotte-airport,Dag Solheim,,I have only used CLT airport twice (once on arrival and once on departure to/from the US) but what an experience. Based on the other comments I may have arrived on a bad day because it took me at least 90 minutes to get through immigration! I had to run for my connecting flight but I was stopped and selected for an extra security check by personnel that was in no hurry to expedite this check and I did of course loose my connecting flight. I have never experienced anything similar to this. I have been a Star Alliance Gold member since 1998 so I do travel some. Although the time needed to get through immigration may vary I have never on my numerous visits to the US (approximately 3-5 times a year since the mid 90s) had to wait as long as at CLT. Please observe that I always try to get a seat making me one of the first out of the plane just to get a head start for immigration.,,0
charlotte-airport,David C. Brown,,My wife and I connected through CLT on our journey from Nashville (BNA) to London Gatwick (LGW) this past December and found this airport to be far superior to Atlanta for connecting flights. Courteous people everywhere you turn along with an excellent airport layout made our journey both easy and pleasant. I can't really offer an opinion on the restaurants there but the numerous Starbucks were noted. US Airways has really made a believer out of me as far as their friendly employees and pleasant flights. I have been to London on nine previous occasions by four different carriers and US Air overall has been the best way to fly. Upon return from Gatwick into Charlotte the journey through US Customs was far quicker than Atlanta Dallas-Ft Worth Houston or Chicago O'Hare. The big difference is in the sheer volume of passengers that are processed at the larger airports that result in the long lines of tired grouchy people. Baggage transfer and the distance to departing domestic gates are well laid out and the use of moving passenger walkways makes your connection a breeze. If you don't mind going through the smaller Gatwick airport for your trip to London I don't believe that you can beat Charlotte International and US Airways.,,0
charlotte-airport,Corey Shreffler,,"I have used CLT for connecting flights several times. It is a very ""pretty"" airport and at times reminds me of a smaller-scale O'Hare (due mainly to the greenhouse-like windows in certain areas). Each time I have gone it has been rather crowded but the facilities are more than adequate to handle the traffic. In addition the signage is quite prominent and the layout does not leave you scratching your head. When I arrived at CLT for the first time I had to walk a few terminals over for my connecting flight. It was quite a trek but with the aid of moving sidewalks it was just a 10-minute walk.",,0
charlotte-airport,John Nolley,,Just returned from Miami to London with a connection in Charlotte - found this airport to be very user-friendly with several restaurants and shops. Not too busy and bliss smoking allowed in the restaurants! Would use again.,,0
charlotte-airport,John Nolley,,I have connected through Charlotte many times on US Air and though it is far from my favorite airport I'll take it over Atlanta for connections any day--it tends to be far less hectic. My chief complaints with the facilities include: the lack of decent eateries (be prepared to pay $8 for a cold sandwich and drink); the sparseness of some of the terminals (can't recall WHICH but I've flown into one a few times that seemed to consist almost wholly of gates; very few stores or eateries); poor transport within / between the terminals (moving walkways only which are often off or filled by people who don't understand the concept of standing to the right to let those of us running to catch a tight connection by); poor seating at the gates (including sparse power outlets for those of us who'd charge our phones or use laptops while we wait); and the lack of free wireless networking. Also it's often cheaper to connect through Charlotte than it is to originate there-- I've seen differences (involving the same connecting flight) of several hundred $$s before which strikes me as very odd given the extra flight leg involved when not originating in Charlotte. Still Charlotte doesn't seem to experience as many weather-related delays as Atlanta and it is much more sedate in terms of sheer volume of people.,,0
charlotte-airport,John Logie,,We connected at Charlotte with US Air on our way from Gatwick to Orlando. Unfortunately we didn't get to chance to experience any of its facilities as immigration was staffed by 2 immigration officers which meant that it took us a ridiculous 75 minutes to clear immigration. We then ordered by the US Air reps to sprint to the gate for our connecting flight which ended up feeling like more of a marathon than a sprint. Seemed nice and clean but hey it's hard to tell when your running as fast as you can with hand luggage etc. Our recommendation is to make sure your at the front of the line when getting off your plane so you don't end up at the back of a line of over 300 people being serviced by 2 surly immigration officials.,,0
chattanooga-metropolitan-airport,John Pelham,,CHA is a compact but efficient airport serving a metropolitan market of about 500000 residents. In the past it has suffered from proximity to major airports in Nashville and Atlanta but today 7 airlines service Chattanooga with a rather rapidly growing number of destinations. The airport is very clean with free Wi-Fi throughout and parking and security is superior. Low fare airlines have joined the legacy carriers so there is quite a nice selection of flights and fares. Sure saves time and headaches of leaving from larger airports.,5,0
chattanooga-metropolitan-airport,Bill Peterson,,CHA has the misfortune of being too close to Atlanta. Over half of Chattanooga flyers drive to Atlanta (or Nashville or Birmingham) to fly. However CHA offers competitive fares and I would guess most flights now are regional jet. The airport itself is beautiful with a large copper dome as the facility's trademark (in honor of the city's railroad heritage). CHA is a modern state-of-the-art airport and is where I choose to fly out of even though I live in the northern Atlanta 'burbs.,,0
chattanooga-metropolitan-airport,Corey Shreffler,,As a resident of Chattanooga I have used this airport on several occasions. With just 5 gates it seems to be a bit undersized for a city of 160000. However speaking from an architectural perspective it has more character than most airports I have flown through and is very clean besides. There is virtually no chance of getting lost owing to the small size and simple layout. The security checkpoint is neither intimidating nor cumbersome but the agents are thorough and will search your bags if needed. CHA recently added a daily direct flight to Dallas/Fort Worth and will soon follow up with direct service to Houston and Orlando. Other cities with direct service to and from CHA include: Atlanta Chicago Charlotte Washington (DC) Cincinnati and Memphis. CHA really is a connected airport and getting moreso all the time apparently.,,0
chattanooga-metropolitan-airport,Jalaal Elasmar,,One of the easiest domestic airports to figure out. Just a couple of restaurants but each one has great selection of food. They've been getting better flights and it is transitioning to more of a transit type airport. Staff is scarce but ticket counters are fast to check-in and the security line is real quick(5 minutes at the most). I now start my journey to any destination from here.,,0
chengdu-airport,H Bartlett,United Kingdom,Arrived at Chengdu on domestic flight from Shenzhen. No problems getting to town on the bus. A dew days later I had to depart on a domestic flight to Jiuzhaigou. Beware there are two terminals both a distance from each other. I got off at the wrong terminal no sign of a transfer bus so I had walk. Not much fun in the rain.,5,1
chengdu-airport,Satish Sakrikar,India,Chengdu Terminal 2 looked new and clean. Despite Air China advice to reach airport 3 hours in advance the check in counter opened only 1.5 hours before departure. Check in immigration and security were efficient and quick. The departures waiting area had nothing of interest even for Chinese travelers let alone foreign ones. There were several shops selling the same souvenirs at inflated prices. The shop girls were standing bored as no customers even entered the shops. There was one book shop selling only Chinese books and 2 restaurants serving standard bland and tasteless fare not the renowned Sichuan cuisine again at inflated prices. The waiting area for our flight was barricaded off and pax had to sit at some other gate. Absolutely nothing for international passengers and it seemed even for Chinese. Even Domestic termini are better.,1,0
chengdu-airport,Peter Thackray,United Kingdom,XIY-CTU-AUH. Arrived from Xi'an on domestic flight in Terminal 3 which was newly opened in Spring 2012. All very clean and tidy with clear signs in Mandarin and English. Quite a long walk to Baggage Reclaim for the furthest gates but not unreasonable. Toilets clean and plentiful with both squat and regular options. For International Departures there are 2 main dining options before Check-in either KFC or local Chinese food. There are a few stores selling various local foods and some souvenirs. Check-In pretty good and Passport Control and Security all pretty smooth. No requirement to remove belts or laptops for security scanning but do enforce the 100ml liquid rules from Europe. In the International Departures no dining opportunities but a couple of coffee-shop options along with the usual array of Duty Free shops. Most departures are from one of the 11 airbridges. Announcements made in both Chinese and English. Toilets are clean.,8,1
chengdu-airport,K Sumani,Malaysia,KUL-CTU-KUL. The Shuanglin terminal is equipped with all the usual amenities. The toilets are clean the terminal is clean. The terminal also has signs in English/Chinese. Going through customs and immigration is a breeze. You can reach the city centre easily by bus or taxi however signs to the bus outside was not to clearly shown.,9,1
chengdu-airport,G Bray,,This is the major airport for southwest China. Flew into Chengdu from Shenzhen where it was quite a lengthy walk from the Terminal 2 gate to baggage claim. This was topped off with a further lengthy walk to the opposite end of the terminal for the taxi rank. Flying out a week later I had time to look at the airport more closely. Terminal 1 is old and definitely looking it's age. Terminal 2 was shiny and modern with three fingers that extend out. Plenty of interesting shops to keep myself amused inside the terminal and the lounges were adequately comfortable. The feeling was light and airy inside with a good view to the outside despite the extra glass screen separating arriving passengers from departing ones.,4,0
chennai-airport,S Miller,United Kingdom,I had the misfortune to fly home from Chennai airport just under two weeks ago. It must be the slowest airport in the world. I've been to India six times now so am well acquainted with the slowness of almost everything in the country. However one expects better of an airport especially one that's fairly new and modern-looking and no other Indian airport I've travelled flown home from has been as bad. The first queue was a long one but no longer than many other airport queues I've been in but unlike in most other airports it hardly moved the queue for immigration at Heathrow when I got home was just as long but constantly moving so didn't take too long. The Chennai queue was unbelievably slow. Then came the queues (plural) for security. I understand that they have good reason to take security seriously and I'm glad they do but they kept recalling bags to have another look at them and then someone would search them by hand. One young woman who was just in front of me had her handbag taken from her and put through three times and searched by hand twice - this really can only mean that the staff didn't do it correctly the first time unless it was the result of a malicious desire to make passengers miss their flights. My bag was put through the scanner twice and searched by hand. I saw this happening to other people too. This was on top of the body searches of course (which I know are necessary but do add more time to the process). This is without question the most inefficient airport I've ever used and I shall do my best never to have to use it again.,1,0
chennai-airport,Jai Muthu,United States,I have visited Chennai airport 6-7 times in last 10 years. Surprised to see that despite having world class airports so close (Bangalore and Hyderabad - I visited both and they are excellent) Chennai didn't learn any lessons. Both the International and Domestic terminals are messy. Not clean and I am sure many wouldn't like to use the rest rooms. There are not too many options in the terminal for restaurants or bars or shopping. You will always see a few people being escorted by airport employees to the immigration and for security clearance causing irritation among the people standing in queue. There is no medical assistance or pharmacy either.,1,0
chennai-airport,Vishal Shrivastava,India,Used the airport on January 8 2015 as part of my transit to Delhi. Had extended stay there as my connection missed and needless I say the experience was nice and better than what it was when I used in four years back. The new terminal is excellent  well stocked and surprisingly clean than many similar Indian Airports. The only problem encountered was the security which is still slow and tacky to negotiate.,8,1
chennai-airport,Subramanian Vilayannur Hariharan,India,The old airport is of a very low standard without any facilities. Toilets are not clean and smell. The newly constructed International terminal looks fine from outside. Even though airport may be small facilities and ground staff are the parameters which make an airport among one of the best.,2,0
chennai-airport,Vijayakumar Arumugam,Australia,I flew in to Chennai airport from Sydney recently along with my Australian colleague. The first impression of the new airport is still disappointing with the promised changes not being seen anywhere. With the travelators not working its a long walk to the immigration counters. I had a quick passage through the immigration whilst my Australian colleague didn't have too much luck. The Malaysian airlines stewardess didn't provide him with the immigration card. He was asked to fill it in at the immigration counter which was fine. The immigration official was insistent on exactly knowing the address of the hotel where he was going to stay. The officials tone and tenor was disappointing. This is definitely not the way for the immigration officials to conduct themselves. Overall Chennai airport is a huge disappointment.,3,0
chennai-airport,Donald Bergkamp,Canada,Passed through MAA three times - once in transit one arrival and one departure. This airport should be avoided if you have any choice or option. Arrival was at 3am from LHR very long walk to old terminal for immigration although both immigration and baggage were quick and cheerful. Outside the terminal is a complete zoo. No easy public transport. Luckily we had a driver. Transit involved a 4.5 hour change from international to international flight. We were met off the flight by airline staff who did not identify themselves as such until asked then placed in quarantine in a locked area with two other transit passengers. The only facilities were a water fountain and a dirty toilet with no paper. The staff took our passports boarding passes and luggage receipts. To my relief they did come back an hour later with new boarding passes and luggage tags and let us out of the locked area. It did all work in the end - we made our connection and our bags arrived at LHR - it just wasn't very pleasant Facilities at this airport - food shopping wifi toilets and lounges - are all minimal or poor and anywhere from unclean to filthy dirty.,3,0
chennai-airport,Mohammed Shuaib,Bahrain,Chennai airport needs to address the following: Cleanliness in the terminal no tissues in the washrooms rusted pipes in the water dispensers open waste bins near the restaurants. Lot of makeshift equipment and ladders placed around. No 'wet floor' sign used when cleaning. The sign board to 'Terminals' is hidden by a Police barricade as you approach the airport from GST road. Commendable part is the immigration which is quick and to the point. Security needs to be more faster or more lanes to be added. More variety in the restaurants is needed. Long wait to travel between domestic and international terminals. I am sure the airport can be made a lot better than what it is now.,,0
chennai-airport,V Sitaraman,India,The new international terminal that looks grand from outside is badly planned inside. Construction dirt and grime are seen on all white-painted columns and girders. The lounge is located on a higher floor and is accessible only by lift. An escalator would have moved people more conveniently. Anyway the lounge is pathetic compared to the lounges in the old terminal. There is no arrival immigration in the new terminal and passengers are forced to walk some 500 m to the immigration counters in the old terminal. The smelly toilets seem to have been transplanted from the old terminal and are maintained just as filthy. One cannot help comparing this airport to the cleanly maintained private airports at Bangalore and Hyderabad. Wonder when immigration and baggage handling facilities will be available in the new terminal.,2,0
chennai-airport,Jay Kumar,Singapore,I was there a couple of months ago and was shocked to see carpets instead of tiles in the new departure lounge. Needless to say they were badly stained. Everything else was lousy I asked at the book-shop about Indian news- magazines and was snobbishly told that only foreign publications were available. The food and drink available is expensive and awful. Truly a disgusting experience.,,0
chennai-airport,Prasad Kishore,United States,The brand new terminal is falling apart. Tiles broken/cracking all over the place. Who was the genius that recommended fabric seats-they are very badly stained. Bathrooms smell and flood all over the place.,1,0
chennai-airport,Alan Whelan,India,This airport is a dump. It's meant to be brand new. There are signs for a food court - no food court just some terrible looking lounge that you can only enter if you have a certain type of Visa card. There used to be one bar but someone in their infinite wisdom decided to shut this down without providing an alternative facility. What sort of person presides over this fiasco of a facility?. It's filthy dirty and the staff have no idea how to deal with customers. Unfortunately as with any airport one doesn't have a choice but to use it. Shame on this airport and the management of it.,,0
chennai-airport,M Gomes,United Kingdom,Filthy (even the new international terminal) chaotic and certainly not recommended if you can avoid it. The so called business class lounge (La Meridian) is a joke and no matter how much the airlines pay to use it I assure you it is 100% too much. Food is terrible and drinks limited. If you are arriving here try to do it without checked in baggage baggage reclaim can take more than 60 minutes! On the plus side some of the staff I found helpful on the departure side. At all costs avoid.,,0
chennai-airport,U Vamsi,India,"Cant say more about an airport that has been built only as a ""Show put up"". I travelled by an AI flight (International) from Mumbai to Chennai that was already 1 hour late. Landed at 12am in the morning only to be kept waiting for baggage that didn't come out for 30 mins. I saw a baggage security point that has been put just immediately near the downward escalator. There was a huge line of people trying to put their baggage in the security screening area but there could have been a big disaster with all the people coming down on the escalator and the crowd ahead not moving beyond the baggage screening. Luckily nothing happened. I travel often to Chennai on work. Must say that I have stopped using the Washrooms in this airport as they have become dirtier than before. The so called garden inside the airport is all dried up. The same old shops that have been moved from old terminal to the new one.",1,0
chennai-airport,Vijayakumar Arumugam,Australia,I visited Chennai a few times in the last month (Bangalore - Chennai domestic leg - Jet Airways Chennai - Pune domestic leg on GoAir Pune - Chennai domestic leg and Chennai - Delhi international Air India en route to Sydney. The new domestic airport is functional and it's good to see aerobridges being used for domestic flights. They have segregated the arrival and departure at the domestic terminal across two levels. However they still don't have the in-line baggage for the GoAir domestic flights. The biggest disappointment is the international section of the airport. The bathrooms are nothing to rave home about. The gates are still in the old terminal with a long walk to them. There is not a single good bookstore with a good collection of books. The shops try to fleece the customers with different prices for different passenger based on nationalities. This doesn't happen in New Delhi or in Hyderabad or in Bangalore. They don't give receipts for the purchase in the stores unless you ask for it.,2,0
chennai-airport,D Williams,India,Every time I enter this new so called 'swanky' terminal I keep looking (at regular intervals) at the roof and the glass panels just to make sure I'm not in way of something falling off. Surely this is the lousiest and dirtiest 'new' terminal built in the recent past. The end product is a big disappointment for those of us who have been waiting for a new terminal for over several years. This is not an 'international' airport to feel proud about. The funniest part of this airport is that only the check-in is in the new terminal and then you are led in a 'smelly' pathway (without AC) that connects the old airport for boarding the flight. The (striking) AAI staff neither want to keep this terminal clean nor allow private interested parties to maintain this airport - too bad. If I were to rate this airport on a scale of 1-10 I would definitely rate it at '1' just because when you look at it from a distance (from the roadside) it looks swanky especially when the lights are on at night!,1,0
chennai-airport,Shiva Sitaraman,United States,"Compared to the airports in Bangalore and Hyderabad the international terminal here is a joke. Arrival is in the old smelly terminal. Once outside chaos reigns while trying to get to your pre-paid taxi. I was pleasantly surprised while departing to see a spanking new terminal. However once inside this ""new"" terminal is already looking old with dirty carpets and glass windows. The worst part was that this new terminal is just a facade. One goes down the escalator to the boarding gates and finds oneself back in the old terminal once again. This so- called gateway to South India needs a new airport privately built and managed. Definitely not recommend this airport.",3,0
chennai-airport,J Nithin,India,Charging Rs.60-70 for vehicles dropping of passengers is outright daylight robbery. Either they should keep guards like in Mumbai or Hyderabad to ward off vehicles who park on the road or they should just increase the time at least for taxis. Every time I go to the airport I get annoyed. I don't even want to go into the toilets issue and lack of eating joints.,1,0
chennai-airport,Vishwanath Mahapatra,India,I don't think I have ever been to a worse airport. I don't know why they have wasted money in revamping the whole place. Just giving it a bigger structure doesn't mean renovation. All those old worthless shops are still there. Food is bad. Toilets are as bad as they were in the older airport. There's no proper bar or smoking lounge. There are no food chains. The baggage counters are a total disaster. Staff are bad. My advice: avoid using this airport if you can.,,0
chennai-airport,Arya Viswanathan,United Kingdom,I cannot think of any airport worse than Chennai airport. There is a constant smell in the building and the biggest nightmare are the toilets which are almost always wet and unclean. The airport resembles a bus station. Add to this arrogant security personnel and semi-educated staff it amounts to the worst airport in the world. What is sad is that these un-inspired people just need to compare with Hyderabad to see how bad they are. The pain just continues when you go outside to be cheated by the auto/taxi people.,1,0
chennai-airport,S Menon,India,The new domestic terminal seems to be improving by the day. Ample space at the drop -off area on the departure side with separate entrances for airlines clearly marked . Couple of coffee shops outside which is welcome if you have friends / relatives seeing you off. Inside there are multiple options now in terms of coffee shops restaurants (couple of them are due to open) book -shops and other small shops. Ample seating space and the quality of announcements is also very clear. The washrooms have received a lot of bad press since the terminal opened but that seems to be improving now. Not everything can be blamed on bad maintenance here some of it is also dependent on user behavior. Also noticed that there was no regular cleaning of the trash bins and most of them were on the verge of over flowing. Something needs to be done about this. The arrival side has an easy access to the car park with a luggage ramp which is quite helpful. Only minus point is the long walk from the gates to the baggage claim area. Overall an airport which is improving by the day.,7,1
chennai-airport,Prayash Giria,India,Had to use the airport to take a 5am flight reached the airport at 1.30 hoping to have some dinner before checking in. Surprisingly the airport terminals were shut! The cityside has no passenger facilities - no toilets no food outlets no phone booths and no security. For a crowd of 300 about to catch the first few flights there were just 4 security guards. Terminals opened at 3am. This 'new' airport has just two outdated X-ray machines for baggage screening. Horrible queues. Airside area is equally pathetic with horrible loos. No clarity on boarding gates as there were no announcements the screens spent an unusually long time displaying information in Tamil. Additionally the design highlight of the new terminal an in-terminal garden is hardly viewable for dust on the glass curtain walls. Charging points seemed to be inactive through the terminal and the so-called food court is yet to open. All in all the most pathetic airport I've had to use.,,0
chennai-airport,V Uppu,India,This airport never changes. The new terminal is less than a year old and its already showing its age. Especially the washrooms. I hate using the loos of this airport with Wet floors leaking taps and worst of all the staff don't care. This airport is definitely not at all up to the mark. The staff are particularly disinterested in managing the show! Brand new class exteriors are the only thing good to see.,,0
chennai-airport,Arun Koneri,United States,Back to MAA again after 4 months. Pretty much the same as before. Long lines at the airline counter but no lines at immigration. Security was ok. Immigration staff were pleasant on both directions. One complaint I have is that there are no announcements in Tamil in this airport. None of the airlines bothered in my 2 hours waiting.,5,1
chennai-airport,Arun Koneri,United States,Flew into and out of the airport in December a year after my last trip. Arrival pretty much the same as before. Immigration queues are long and slow. Bags took a while to arrive and no issues with customs. Crowd management outside the airport can be better hopefully the new terminal will work better. On departure I did not have a print out of my boarding pass but the security personnel accepted the ticket on my tablet but with a warning. Immigration is long and took an hour to get through security was quick. They have moved the location of security for the better and airside is much more spacious with lots of seats. I've always found immigration personal friendly in Chennai airport and have never encountered a grumpy one. Overall standard Indian airport with not many amenities hope they open the new terminal soon.,5,1
chennai-airport,A Munnings,Netherlands,Chennai Airport will hopefully be replaced with the new terminal in the near future honestly I found the business class really poor and very over crowded with limited choice and poor options. I did not stay long preferring to walk the terminal than sit in an area that I did not feel welcome. The terminal for departures is not particularly clean but does seem to work most staff are polite but not particularly friendly although I did not find the rude either. They do love rubber stamps though. The arrivals process was quick although immigration did seem to take longer by western standards it is not that bad for the rest of the world. Roll on the new terminal - it must be better than this.,4,1
chennai-airport,P Val,Singapore,Flew on the night AI flight from SIN to MAA and back. Overall this is an airport that gets you in and out without nothing much to do in between unlike Changi. Having said that I prefer MAA over BOM DEL CCU or BLR simply for the small size closeness to the city and the un-chaotic nature of the airport. Immigration and customs have been pretty decent. Some construction going on and can't wait to travel through the new terminal. Hopefully it will be better! Only gripe is the lateness of baggage arrival especially during nights when most international flights arrive. They need more handlers customs officers and most importantly more conveyor belts!,8,1
chennai-airport,Vijayakumar Arumugam,Australia,I recently used Chennai airport's international and domestic terminals for transit to Madurai from Sydney as well for the return trip back to Sydney. The international terminal has some improved facilities with the inline baggage scanning system reducing the time to check-in. The immigration customs and baggage arrival are quite smooth though the customs and immigration officials could be groomed a bit to be passenger- friendly. They let domestic passengers enter the terminal even if the flight is 5 hours away which is a positive. However the biggest gripe is about the toilets. The toilets are smelly unkempt and very poor both in the international as well as in the domestic terminal. The domestic terminal doesn't have enough seats which forces passengers to sit on the floor. They still use the buses to get the passengers to the aircraft on the domestic side of the terminal.,3,0
chennai-airport,N Vijayanand,India,I have flown from Chennai 5 times (all international travel). I saw some expansion works in Dec 2011. Every something is being expanded but at a very slow pace. When I entered the airport the floor was not clean was not able to enter the toilets - everywhere smelt. When I complained airport staffs behaved in a very rude manner. Security checks were impressive and very strict cleared everything in 10 minutes. Immigration at departure and arrival in Chennai is always a nightmare. Immigration officers spend more than 10 minutes on each person. Hope to see improvements in the near future.,3,1
chennai-airport,Elza Varughese,India,2012 and I'm not sure this airport has budged in terms of quality ratings. It's about relativity and considering the time gone by a lot of airports in India have come a long way not just gleaming glass and steel structures also aesthetics amenities cleanliness and just looking like it belongs to the right time period. Chennai airport in 2012 reminded me of Mumbai's in the 90's if you don't see the signs to the toilet your nose can rescue you.,4,0
chennai-airport,M Shukry,Sri Lanka,Officials are awful security staff make the traveller uncomfortable and keep scolding passengers. Immigration process takes too long by staff with a long face but luckily they don't scold the passengers. Duty free has good options. Airport floor and washroom are extremely unclean. Not enough signs and flight information boards.,1,0
chennai-airport,Kennet Foeh,Denmark,"This is a very poor airport. Toilets are disgusting. After check-in it gets even worse. A very dark and old- looking place. No signs or information of any kind. No view of the planes. Only upside is that nobody arrives early so we were quickly through security and check-in. There are no restaurants or shops. Just a very strange bookstore and a small ""cart"".",2,0
chennai-airport,N Jebamoney,Australia,I flew in and out of Chennai last week. Traveled to Tuticorin during the week and back to Chennai to catch the international flight. I had 5 hrs before my flight was not allowed into the international area for at least 2 hrs no suggestion of where you could rest. I spoke to the security staff at the visitors viewing gallery and was let in and sat around for 2 hrs unable to use the washroom facilities as I was unable to leave my baggage unsupervised. Once International check-in was completed had to sit in the gate lounge for nearly 2 hrs. Washroom facilities were filthy toilets were filthy awash with water no soap to wash hands. Terrible experience - please clean up your act.,2,0
chennai-airport,A Milossavlyevich,Turkey,Chennai airport is a disaster. Visitors not allowed inside the terminal oppressive security staff everywhere whose rationale is impossible to grasp. Had to wait for several hours outside the terminal unable to re-enter the terminal after arriving on a night flight an hour ago. This airport is definitely to be avoided although I've noticed similar measures and problems in other Indian airports as well.,4,0
chennai-airport,Darryl Knight,Australia,Flew in and out of Chennai International and domestic four times in Dec 2011 and Jan 2012. Arriving from Singapore was the worst it was a wet night and after purchasing the prepaid taxi voucher I exited the terminal to a scene from hell. Fifty or more taxis trying to load passengers in the rain. There was no proper queue arranged and it was a free for all. I last used Chennai airport in 2004 and it has just deteriorated since filthy toilets piles of rubbish swept into heaps beside overflowing rubbish bins with dirty chairs.,3,0
chennai-airport,Dhabi Vala,United Arab Emirates,Things are improving although slowly. Airport terminals are becoming larger newer with more international arrival and departure flights. Passengers have to be bear the brunt queuing time at immigration and security is too much. With more flights there is no increase in immigration and security counters no priority for women children or elderly passengers. Passengers spending so much time queuing only increases anxiety of the already stressed traveler. An increase of seating and cleanliness can be improved.,4,0
chennai-airport,A Syed,United States,Chaos is the one word which encompasses Madras airport. I think the people of this city ought to be ashamed of this gateway to this city. Filth grime poor hygiene and generally impolite staff make this an awful airport to arrive or depart through. The security staff are terrible. If you can avoid this airport then do so. I doubt if the modern new terminal is going to be any different since the staff running it will be the same.,1,0
chennai-airport,Arun Koneri,United States,No change since last visit. Terminals are not the most modern. Bathrooms are not very clean and food options very limited. Seating options are very less as well for there are many international flights leaving within a small window. Security was quick and as always immigration officials are pleasant and chatty. This airport is not one where you want to be stuck for long. Can't wait for the new terminals to open up.,4,0
chennai-airport,Vijayakumar Arumugam,,I recently used visited MAA via Cathay Pacific from Sydney and left for Sydney on Thai. The airport still has the staid look on it though the number of immigration counters seems to have increased. The luggage took a while to arrive. On the return leg the immigration and the security were a breeze; however the allocation of gates and the announcements leave a lot to be desired. The food items are overpriced and the toilets are quite unclean.,1,0
chennai-airport,D Epstein,,Used Chennai airport (arrival from BKK at 23:30) and departure to BKK at 0025. Security checks on arrival and departure are very strict but well organised and going through is relatively swift taken into account the ageing building. My flights being at night both on arrival and departure I could experience on arrival a problem for locating an exchange booth which is operated by Thomas Cook but in a remote corner stall. When outside the crowd and dim lights give a feeling of unsafety. On late night departure after the process of check-in airside hall is a shame for regular travellers ie. the ones not holding a pass to use VIP rooms. Ranks of dirty seats (check before you seat down) probably never cleaned up. No facility except one small food stall selling bad veg sandwiches and few drinks at extravagant price for India. No restaurant despite a sign showing there has been one may be 2 centuries ago - toilet and drinking water also to be avoided. All in all an unpleasant experience as no comfort and dirty place.,1,0
chennai-airport,A Swamy,,"Used Chennai Airport for International arrival at 2330 and Domestic departure at 0555. Swine flu Immigration and Customs checks very swift as ours was the only plane arriving. The baggage though took more than 15 minutes to arrive on the belts. Had to walk just 5 mins to the domestic terminal for the early morning departure. ""Tired looking"" is an understatement for the domestic terminal. There were more than 100 passengers waiting for morning domestic flights after international arrival. No proper seating arrangements and many were sitting or sleeping on the floor. Toilets were awful and stinking. The whole terminal building is in a miserable condition.",1,0
chennai-airport,Arun Koneri,,Used Chennai airport for domestic arrival and intl departures last week. The new domestic arrival is now part of the intl terminal and is new. Took 10 minutes from plane to curb side (no checked bags). very impressed. The arrivals hall is spacious and well lit. Intl Departures has been a consistently good experience over the past 2-3 years. My flight departed at 21:30 so customs immigration and security all deserted. Immigration officials in Chennai more civil and polite than Delhi. overall good experience.,4,0
chennai-airport,Jonathan Kelly,,From plane to car took no more than 20 minutes which was great but airport itself looked very old and tired. Flew home from different airport (the modern but awful Cochin) so was spared the departure experience.,2,0
chennai-airport,G Barnes,,The facilities for transfer passengers domestic flight to international with a long wait between flights are poor. There is only one very small and not good quality restaurant. There is no where to rest in reasonable comfort.,2,0
chennai-airport,K Müller,,I used Madras Airport twice in the space of five days: once for an international departure and once in transit. Departing at noon the airport was not particularly busy. Nevertheless checking in at the Jet Airways counter (Premiere) took forever - it seemed the party ahead of me with more than one piece of checked baggage per head completely brought down the entire system. Lounge comfortable security swift but I fail to understand how so many passengers passed security and boarded our flight with three or even four pieces of hand baggage. Boarding through Gate 5 (bus gate) which is absolutely awful in terms of state of disrepair and trash all over the place. A few day later I was in transit from Colombo to Frankfurt and upon arrival was asked to leave my ticket and passport with a member of ground staff who eventually returned with my boarding card in hand more than two hours (!) later. Why not have a simple transit desk as everywhere else in the world?,3,0
chennai-airport,Arun Koneri,,Chennai Intl terminal is vastly improved since I last visited. Immigration counters on arrival side were staffed well and special attention was given to passengers traveling with children (like us). We were asked to move to an empty line meant for special category of travelers the staff made sure no one else piggy backed on us and other passengers with similar needs were also helped. The baggage area is more spacious and well lit. Exiting the terminal is also a little better as you are buffered from the meet and greet crowd very efficiently. But it was the Intl departure area that has improved more there are more shops and duty free (most items are over priced but they were running 2 for 1 deals on some brands of liquor). A new section has opened up which houses the AI Maharajah lounge as well as the BICA lounge. Security is still a big pain with long queues and the odd passenger trying to break in. Make sure you have a baggage tag on all carry on items (the ones where you write your name for ID that you find at the airline check in desk) security uses this to stamp on. If you don't have one then they will send you back. There is a smoking room past security. For the male traveler restrooms are just barely acceptable not sure about the ladies room. Jet Airways doesn't require you to Xray your bags before check in as they do it inline after check in.,,0
chennai-airport,S Srinivasan,,Recently went through MAA for an international flight for the first time in a long while. The interior is still rather drab much like the Indian airports of yesteryear but the airport is much less congested than Delhi or Mumbai. Upon entry signage for the baggage screening machines (i.e. which one to use for your airline) is poor so you end up having to guess. Immigration counters were well-staffed and took no time at all and customs no longer goes out of their way to harass you like they used to 10 years ago. Shopping/food is dreadfully limited inside the terminal so if you need something to eat try the small food court outside the departures entry gate (the Anjappar restaurant serves decent local fare) or the restaurant on the second floor between the international and domestic terminals. The best thing about MAA is that unlike BOM or DEL the domestic and international terminals are next door to each other so if you have an inbound/outbound domestic connection it's a short 5 minute walk over - thus saving you from getting harassed for tips by the touts running the terminal shuttles or getting ripped off by the taxi/auto drivers.,3,0
chennai-airport,S Narayan,,"Arrivals has continuously improved in the past 4 years. Passport control quick. Luggage arrival may take a while (30 mins to 1 hour); Customs is quick and easy. Smoking permitted inside terminal - a nuisance. Duty free can be purchased upon arrival not much of a choice though. Basic stuff. Foreign exchange - Thomas Cook office within the secure area available. Free local phone call permitted from assistance booth near baggage collection area. Most staff speak good english and respond well. Long-distance / international calls can be placed from telephone booths (labeled ISD/STD) which are manned and you can get receipts. If you have someone to pick you up at the airport: Clear customs; Exit immediately after customs and wait there. You will turn left to exit the ""secure area"". Do not do this unless you have seen the people waiting to receive you. If you have do not have someone to pick you up: Clear customs; Exit and as you turn left you will see two private travel agencies within the secure area (one is Akbar travels and the other is Airport Express). Both of them are prepaid safe reliable. Akbar costs 350 rupees (less than 10 USD) (as of Aug 2008) to a ride anywhere in to Chennai city. Tip the person who rolls your luggage (about 20 to 30 rupees); and tip the driver about the same. Walk very closely to the person who takes your luggage to your car since you might get lost in the crowd outside. MAA International Departures: Arrive at least 3 to 4 hours prior to departure time. Must have a ticket / itinerary printed and in your hand with passport to get in to the airport. No other options allowed. Check-in queues are very long and slow. Elite status helps (depending on airline). No food for purchase prior to check-in. Passport control is usually quick (max 30 minutes with a 100 people in line). Duty free available. Overpriced food available prior to and after security check (for your handbags etc). The food is actually good in the mornings (between 6 to 9:30 AM) and after that its not that great. Make sure you have a luggage tag for your hand baggage - this is true for all Indian airports. They will make you leave the line and go and get one. Also make sure you have exactly one piece of hand baggage...no matter what it is.(so fit everything in to one bag). Did not use any lounges. MAA Local airport: NEed ticket with ID to enter airport. Some food available prior to check-in. All luggage is screened with X-ray machines similar to international airport. These queues are long. Otherwise its generally quick to get through to check luggage and clear security. Individual airlines may be slow depending on quality of service. After security check there is extremely overpriced stuff to eat. A coffee dispensing machine. Its pretty boring otherwise. Nothing to do except people-watch. Most airlines need you to take a bus to the plane. Watch for the gates being called out. You could easily miss the call - but they track you down anyway if they know you checked-in.",4,0
chennai-airport,Arun Koneri,,I have lived in Chennai for over 25 years and currently reside in USA my home for the last 10 years. Frankly Chennai airport is a nightmare. Having lived in India for long I can put up with less-than-sparkling toilets but what amazes me is the perennial air-conditioning problems in the airport. It is not that air-conditioning technology is rocket science. It has been in vogue for almost 100 years now. Why then is it so difficult to make the air-conditioning effective? The nearly year-long hot and humid weather of Chennai makes the airport suffocating. I really pity the westerners who have to put up with this fuming and sweating. Other attractions of Chennai airport include glum-faced immigration inspectors who cannot smile or even utter a word of welcome to foreigners visiting our country indifferent and unhelpful airport staff etc. The sooner all airports are privatized in our country the better.,3,0
chennai-airport,S Wilson,,We have gone through Chennai Airport recently in 2006 and again just a few weeks ago. Even last year the airport was better than I had expected. This year the improvements to the International Terminal main hall are immense more seating gleaming floors and it seemed slightly less chaotic than our previous transit through it. Tea coffee cold drinks and snacks are available and the facilities are clean enough. Even the arrival and baggage collection on our inbound sector was fine. Despite the fact that the A/C isn't up and running yet I would certainly have Chennai as my airport of choice for entering/leaving India.,4,0
chennai-airport,Kurt Mueller,,With major renovation works almost complete MAA is now more convenient particularly for domestic travellers. There are now two separate check- in areas for all domestic carriers as opposed to only one previously (which was always overcrowded). So checking-in (and particularly baggage screening) is less stressful. Also: new are separate airline lounges but I am not sure whether they are a real improvement. For one the combined Paramount/Sahara lounge does not serve any beer whereas the airport restaurant does. Second all the new lounges lack windows - the airport restaurant offers a spectacular view across the tarmac and runways. Security uncrowded despite my flight departing at 18.50. I checked the prices at the refreshment stand in the departure lounge and the prices are effectively daylight robbery (Rs 60 for a can of Coke). Still a lack of airbridges and most domestic pax have to be taken by bus. At Madras as at most Indian airports there seems to be a competition among airlines as to who can offer the most inaccessible airport bus - with some having you negotiate 4 steps to get on and off. Underslung bus chassis have been around since before WWII so what happened?,3,0
chennai-airport,John Lum by,,Not a bad little airport. Always a scrum before check-in unless you are travelling in business class but generally ok facilities and duty free a bit sparse but fairly clean.,3,0
chennai-airport,Praveen Babu,,I arrived late at night and had an early morning flight to Hyderabad so had to spend the night in the Domestic terminal. Airport itself is quite clean compared to others in India. Airconditioning ineffective so the airport itself was very humid. There seems to be a real mosquito problem in this airport. Overall it was clean security is a joke. Not too many shopping options or food options but tea and coffee as well as candy are available. There is a full time restaurant on the 2nd floor although I didn't try it out. International arrivals hall is surprisingly clean - okay airport for Indian standards.,,0
chennai-airport,Sriram Srinivasan,,Chennai airport is superior to the other Indian international terminals namely Delhi Mumbai and Hyderabad. You have to wait to get in through the front doors but it's usually in the 15-20 minute range as opposed to the nearly one hour cattle stampede I had to deal with in Hyderabad. I wouldn't call the ground crews friendly but they are reasonably efficient and the majority of the flights leave on time. Security and immigration queues are long but not unbearable and definitely shorter than what you have to deal with in Delhi or Mumbai. The A/C doesn't work great but I haven't found an airport in India where it actually does. Overall not great but a tolerable experience.,,0
chennai-airport,T Heywood,,"It's not that bad. Look for the ""retiring rooms"" bookable with the airport manager at the domestic terminal 900 rupees or 650 for a family. If your flight doesn't leave until some unearthly hour use this facility. HBO on the TV 2 beds fridge air con. Hot shower. Don't want to spend money go to the flight viewing deck on the 2nd floor. It's got a cafeteria cooling fans reasonably quiet seating cleaner toilets if you use the ones down the airlines office block on this floor.",,0
chennai-airport,Lynne Reid,,We travelled through Chennai on 5 August arriving from Mumbai connecting to Columbo on Jet Airways. Incoming flight was delayed and I cannot praise the Jet Airways groundstaff who ensured we met our connection enough. They seperated our luggage out personally escorted us through every stage of the transit and escorted is on to the plane. Everything is relative after the horrors of Mumbai airport I found Chennai airport clean and efficient.,,0
chennai-airport,Kurt Müller,,"I often use Madras for international travel as it has better and more frequent connections than Bangalore. In comparison I agree that it is one of the better airports in India particularly the international building. It is reasonably spacious given the passenger numbers and never as chaotic as for instance Delhi. The airline lounges are definitely better in Madras than elsewhere in India. What is frustrating is the basic ""Indian"" layout of having the departure gates separated from the airbridges by a common corridor also used for arrivals so you often find your boarding procedure interrupted by inbound passengers flowing past the door of your boarding gate. This morning I arrived from CMB at 9.05 a.m. passed immigration customs and was in time to check in for a 10.05 a.m. Jet Airways flight at the domestic terminal. Hard to beat!",,0
chennai-airport,Peter Yunes,,I fully agree with the comment from Warren Ezequiel. I couldn't believe such a long delay on immigration. The general hygiene is poor but the the toilets are the worst!!! If the local goverment wants to bring more tourist to Tamil Nadu they should think seriosly about improving the airport image since this is the gate to the country.,,0
chennai-airport,Siva Subramanium,,I have travelled through Chennai airport on several occasions in the last 3 years and have found it to be best in India so I am surprised by many of the comments. International arrivals and baggage claim facilities though primitive are a vast improvement on other airports in the country. On recent trips with LH GF and BA we were through immigration and had collected our baggage within 30mins of arrival; far quicker than at my usual LHR base. Obviously the facilities are lacking and the security formalities on departure take far longer than they should due to the self importance nature of the Indian bureaucratic process but things are definitely moving in the right direction. The domestic terminal is also very pleasant and if your flight departs using one of the aerobridges the upstairs lounge is very peaceful with light music and TV screens showing sporting events from around the world.,,0
chennai-airport,Warren Ezekiel,,Arriving at Chennai airport on an international flight makes one sick. The long lines of people waiting to get their passports stamped on arrival is the beginning of all woes. The area around the conveyor belt is filthy with litter and the staff are not presentable whether it is their dress or even in being polite - this includes the immigration officer who stamps the passport on arrival. He looks at the passport photograph and then looks at the person as if the former was a criminal of some sort. Outside the airport there are umpteen beggars taxi drivers touts and the lot trying to ask one where he is going and whteher their luggage needs to be carried - even if it were a small backpack. Many NRIs of Tamil origin are ashamed of their capital city and they prefer to travel to either Bangalore Kochi or Trivandrum. With several other cities like Bangalore getting a new airport and more international flights I feel many people even to Tamilnadu will be avoiding the Chennai airport in future. The Governments involved must have sufficient police presence at both the airport and train stations to prevent tired international travellers from being harassed. Also the whole of Chennai needs a bit of education in how to be clean. If nothing is going to be done to make Chennai a safe comfortable and clean place for arrival I think it will soon lose its position as 'Gateway to the South'.,,0
chiang-mai-airport,W Coulton,Australia,On arrival passport control was a little slow processing everyone despite our being the only international flight in at the time (A320). That said they have a job to do and I have certainly experienced much slower elsewhere. Some of our bags were already waiting by the time we reached the belt. Overall a fairly painless arrival and out of the building within 35 minutes from arrival. Departure was a pleasure. Security check and bag X-Ray as you enter the terminal. No queues at check-in. Outbound passport processing very quick. Once large departure lounge covering all international gates but it had lots of seats and a pleasant outlook over the runway. Adequate range of retail and food outlets in the waiting area. Very happy with this airport and the experience.,8,1
chiang-mai-airport,Peter Borschberg,Singapore,I find that the airport has made significant improvements and seems to have more traffic. There is hardly any waiting at check-in or for screening. An excellent regional airport with decent food outlets and reasonable prices. It is not overly cluttered with shops and stalls. This is my favourite regional airport.,10,1
chiang-mai-airport,James Halley,United Kingdom,It is almost a joy to fly into this airport and avoid the chaos that is Bangkok. Have arrived on Air Asia non- stop flight from KL several times over past few months and I've only been unlucky once. Departing is even quicker. A big thumbs up to whoever brought in the CIQ system when transiting BKK so you can clear immigration in CNX rather than in BKK.,9,1
chiang-mai-airport,Peter Borschberg,Singapore,This is an efficient medium-sized international gateway which I think is greatly under-utilized. AOT has done a lot in recent years to upgrade the airport with the construction of the terminal extension now used by international passenger traffic. The prices charged at food outlets here are very reasonable.,9,1
chiang-mai-airport,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,Excellent regional airport nicely split within the same terminal between International and Domestic (I used the latter). Spacious and efficient check-in on Air Asia. Plenty of places for a snack or drink. Low key and efficient security. Good signs screens and flight announcements and adequate seating at the gates.,9,1
chiang-mai-airport,James Halley,Thailand,My local airport. My comments are directed not so much at airport administrators but at King Power who run the duty free shop at CNX. They have an outlet in the arrivals hall. Despite the fact that there are only two daily nonstop flights from KL and Singapore KP deem it too late to offer a service late at night when the Air Asia flight from Singapore arrives at 2300. If you are not going to offer goods for pax on these services one has to wonder why they bother to have an outlet there in the first place? But customer service has never been a strong point with KP. I can only assume that pax off the late night flights from Incheon and Taipei suffer the same fate. Welcome to Thailand. Not a great first impression.,5,0
chiang-mai-airport,James Halley,,A facility not many people will no about but worth knowing if the need arises. I had a minor motorcycle accident en rotue to the aiport recently which left my am bloodied and dirty. After checkin I noticed a 'first aid centre' signposted on the first floor of the international departures terminal. I duly found it and the room is staffed with a qualified nurse. She cleaned and dressed the wound and sent me on my way. I had to sign a register to show that I had attended the facility and I was expecting a small charge which I would have happily paid. The cost - nothing?,5,0
chiang-mai-airport,James Halley,,The new look airport is now complete with clear distinction between domestic and international flights. I use this airport several times a month and the improvements were carried out with almost no inconvenience to passengers. It has to be one of the best regional airports around!,5,0
chiang-mai-airport,I Maciver,,A small 'regional' airport that handles some international flights. Though there is a domestic and an international section if you fly Thai you must enter the international section for Thai check-ins. Going thru the initial security at the front door. Warning : all gels liquids etc must be packed in check-on bags. No allowances. Departure lounge is ok - as long as no more than 2 planes are leaving close together. Arrival (domestic) is a breeze - from plane seat to taxi seat (with carry-on) about 7 minutes. Services (food books etc) are limited. Parking in the lot is easy and 'cheap'. Close to city centre - maybe a 10 minute taxi ride. Airport shared with RTAF 41 Squadron.,4,0
chiang-mai-airport,B Drabble,,Great little airport but if you cant find your bags on the domestic arrivals belt they will be in the international arrivals hall about a 5 minute walk at the other end of the airport. International departure gates have a smoking room which far superior to what is on offer at BKK as you can actually see when the plane starts boarding.,4,0
chiang-mai-airport,Peter Lee,,"One of the better regional airports I have visited in recent years. It is small but quite efficient. The restaurant run by Thai Airways is good and very reasonable. The domestic and international sections are now in separate ""terminals"" and construction is presently still ongoing. International customs and immigration clearance is far far better than in Bangkok.",4,0
chiang-mai-airport,P Ruttanaporn,,I like its surrounding and staff are friendly. It is not as bssy as Bkk or Phuket. It is just big enough and up to the international standard to handle flights from other countries in Asia and most certainly several daily flights from BKK.,4,0
chiang-mai-airport,Simon Welch,,A great little airport that I've used many times for domestic flights. It is not a shopping destination like BKK but it does the job just fine.,4,0
chiang-mai-airport,Teddy Chiew,,Just back from Chiang Mai. The immigration took some time to clear although 70% of counter is open my queue hardly moved. Didn't take deal with taxi as had arranged for hotel transfer. When departing few shops and information counter. Quite amusing that luggage scanning is done on the entrance thus making a long queue outside the departure lobby. After check in pass the immigration swiftly and into a quite big empty departure hall with few duty shop open small outlet of black canyon coffee and a small massage centre.,3,0
chiang-mai-airport,James Halley,,The new international terminal is open and airlines have moved their check-in desks finally into the new terminal. It is a modern version of what existed in the old terminal although rumour has it that there will be a TG lounge in the international departures area. The same very limited choice of duty free and a black canyon coffee outlet. You still use the old domestic terminal if travelling to BKK or other Thai airports. Arrivals is a bit more pleasant with a few more immigration desks. Even more limited duty free shop which is closed for very late arrivals. Having waxed lyrical about the meter taxis this service has gone downhill. Arriving at varying times of the day from 0735 to 2330 has seen no taxis at the airport whatsoever. Not good enough. And the bus routes/timetables are as confusing as ever. Still haven't worked out why route 6/L didn't take me to the airport. It got close!,,0
chiang-mai-airport,Steve Koenig,,Arrived at Chiang Mai Airport on a domestic Thai Airlines flight from Bangkok after transferring from a Bangkok Airways flight from Siem Reap. Upon arrival in Chiang Mai we waited and waited for our baggage to arrive. After nearly everyone else had left with their bags we asked around and found that our bags had been sent to the international arrivals area at the other end of the airport. Although our arriving flight was a domestic one the baggage had been transferred at Bangkok (we didn't have to claim it and go through customs there; just passed through customs with our hand carry) so we had to go through customs in Chiang Mai. Process was quick and painless and personnel were friendly. Just wish we'd known earlier.,,0
chiang-mai-airport,Quek Keng Guan,,First time using CNX airport. Immigration staff are warm and friendly. Tried to amuse my daughter after a 3 hr flight from SIN. Airport is small with about 4-5 lanes for immigration clearance and 2-3 belts for baggage claim. There is about 2 fast food outlets 1 ice cream outlet 1 coffee outlet and a Thai resturant (worth the $). After passing through the customs there is only 1 duty free shop in the international terminal. Massage counter in the departure area is 2x the price in the night bazar! Overall the terminal needs to be upgraded to cope with the increasing number of passengers especially from the domestic areas. There is about 3 international flights/day and about 15-20 domestic flights/day. They are in the midst of building a new terminal. The Bangkok Airways lounge for all passengers looks very appealing!,,0
chiang-mai-airport,James Halley,,I live in Chiang Mai and fly in/out at least 4-6 times a month. The airport has been upgraded in the 2 years I have been here and the new TG lounge is really rather nice. Typical thai decor. Adequate snacks/beverages. Why are westerners hung up on alcohol. Is it really impossible to go anywhere without consuming the stuff? BKK is only an hour away!! And that is an airline issue not the airports. Buy an overpriced beer upstairs! The restaurant upstairs is a rip-off but this is not a unique problem to CNX as it is true of just about every airport i can think of (and I travel around 70000 miles a year so i know a few). CNX has much going for it notably the close proximity to the centre of town and the recent addition of a meter taxi service which I always use and a bus service which passes the end of my street if I could just fathom out what their schedule is supposed to be!! and the ability of being able to clear immigration here off most (BUT NOT ALL) connecting flights is a real plus. Some carriers have no agreement so TG in BKK claim (and disputed by BKK customs) to transit BKK and thus benefit from this facility. I arrived in BKK on Gulf Air (GF) and found this out the hard way but no problems with Emirates. So you end up having to clear immigration in BKK travel to CNX as a domestic passenger then reunite yourself with your baggage in the customs hall by walking in 'the wrong way'. Fortunately there is no problem as the security people probably see this off every flight. And to those who dream of flights from the USA or Australia direct to CNX please stop dreaming. We have lost the non-stop narita flight into CNX so the thought of an LAX-CNX flight is sheer fantasy. So we will all be stuck with a night in BKK. A new HKG-CNX flight is about to start with Hong Kong Express. But having seen how they cancel flights from HKG to Guangzhou one wonders how long this will last. But Silk Air to SIN and Air Asia to KL is appreciated and reliable! Travel well travel safe. Then enjoy Chiang Mai. Value for money here is second to none.,,0
chiang-mai-airport,Francis Chan,,Chiangmai Airport is clearly unable to cope with the rapidly increasing traffic. It is always congested and crowded. Having used the airport at least a dozen times over the past year or two I can say that almost always the flights would be delayed no matter what airline you use. Sometimes for just 10-15 minutes sometimes for several hours.,,0
chiang-mai-airport,Terry McManus,,This is what a good local hub is all about. Although not very big by international standards it is a very user friendly Airport with good facilities shops bars etc. Located only about 10 minutes from the centre of town by taxi it is very easy to get to and even easier to leave from. A pleasure to use and reflective of the goodwill and even bigger welcome smiles from the people of Northern Thailand.,,0
chiang-mai-airport,Mike Gallant,,Surprised to learn how small Chiang Mai airport is and yet hosts many large aircraft each day (Thai A300-600 and Orient Thai B747-200). My overall impression of the airport was okay. The TG Biz/First Class Lounge was adequate had a good number of food items (better than many lounges at larger airports I've visited - namely DTW and NRT). But no alcohol (just like TG flights even in premium cabin). Too bad there is no bus transit service to town (though the flat rate of $100 baht for cab fare is not so bad).,,0
chiang-mai-airport,Pisut Ruttanaporn,,I come from Chiang Mai. So I use this airport to get out of the city pretty regularly. The airport is quite small but it has all the the modern equipments that other international airports have. It can be crowded with passengers all day long which makes it so lively to remind you to get there early for your flight. The airport is on its way for expansion. There is some improvement on the runway and I believe the internal terminal has been upgraded to take more passengers too. I heard that in the near future there will be some inter-continental flights come to CNX regularly too. I like this idea because I can skip the overnight stay in BKK when I got to Thailand from America or Australia.,,0
chiang-mai-airport,Bryan Chao,,It's quite small old facility and stuffed with many amenities - post office bank duty-free souvenir shops snack bars transportation/hotel kiosk and even massage chairs. But there is not much room there. Baggage claim area can be very hard to maneuver for Airbus 300 passenger load. Interior decoration is heavy with Thai hand crafts. It's only 15-min ride from city center.,,0
chiang-rai-airport,James Choochot,United Kingdom,"Visited for Songkran this year. Lovely to be met by Thai dancers in traditional outfits. That's where the satisfaction ended. My phone credit had run out. There is nowhere available in the terminal to purchase a top-up. I was being picked up and could not contact my driver. ""Information services"" suggested I take a taxi into city buy a top-up at 7/11 then come back to airport. How ludicrous? No offer of using the phone. told to try public phone. Refused to give me change of baht 1000 note as that was all I had. No customer service whatsoever.",,0
chiang-rai-airport,Richard Atkinson,,Very nice small airport easy check in with friendly staff. Plenty of seating in the airport with small selection of shops and restaurants and bars. Parking for cars very close to terminal and with plenty of spaces. Easy access to main roads when you leave the airport. Baggage reclaim very quick. A pleasure to arrive at this airport.,,0
chicago-midway-airport,S Koenig,Brazil,We arrived at Midway and departed from O'Hare so didn't experienced waits at ticket counters security etc. Once we arrived we were quickly met by an attendant as my wife had requested wheelchair assistance and were soon at the baggage carousel area. Our bags quickly arrived and we got a taxi just a few yards away. The airport is nothing fancy but in our case at least it was easy to use.,8,1
chicago-midway-airport,R Ellis,United States,"I would like to comment on the rudeness of the Parking personnel. I was being dropped off at the airport and before I could even open the door the crazy person starts screaming ""You cant stop there"". How are people supposed to get out of the car you are not parking just getting. The time she wasted screaming was very unnecessary. The people need training on how to deal with the public doing your job is one thing but arguing with people is unnecessary. I stood and watched this idiot for about ten minutes doing the same to other cars. Two minutes is not a lifetime and Midway is getting to be the worst for dropping off and picking up passengers. The same when you pick up as soon as the car stops you are warned to keep moving. I can't stand those rude ignorant untrained people. Do they ever travel? Do they get the same treatment.",5,1
chicago-midway-airport,S Miller,United States,This airport is not large enough to handle the amount of passengers that go through it. It has insufficient seating due to the small nature of the terminal. Flights overlap and many passengers have trouble finding seats. Other than the lack of seating the airport is normal. The restrooms are very clean and can accommodate many so queues do not form.,6,0
chicago-midway-airport,Lee Ho Seok,United States,Recently flown in and out of MDW as well as transited through this airport. Would not be the best airport in the world but certainly better than ORD as well as many other U.S. airports. Cannot say much about check-in times as check-in at the counter mostly avoided due to web check-in but the security checkpoint sometimes could form quite a bit of queue. However the lines are processed relatively fast so no need to be totally terrified at the scene. Airside seems to be better than landside. The concourses are actually quite spacious with lots of eateries and other shops. The concourses and the restrooms fairly clean and well maintained. No free wifi but at least power outlets are abundant. Ground transportation also fair. The orange line connects MDW with downtown so at least a reliable option is there for those wanting to visit downtown. However no direct links from the interstate to MDW. Better option than ORD especially when transiting.,7,1
chicago-midway-airport,Allan Rudy-Froese,United States,I like that the gates where I as at (concourse A) there were no loud TVs or music playing. Travelling is loud enough. We don't need FOX or CNN filling our acoustic space. The free w-fi is as it should be.,9,1
chicago-midway-airport,A Galanis,United States,Very easy to transport yourself from gate to gate. Luggage area plenty of space and good display boards to find your luggage carousel. I appreciate airports that have glass pains where you can see the airline activity from any gate and Midway creates a nice travel atmosphere. could use more shops and eaterys.,4,0
chicago-midway-airport,J Chou,United States,I went through and connected at Midway during the holiday season and it was very stressing. The terminals seem cramped and were extremely crowded. The food choices were overpriced and with little variety but there seemed to be some nice sit down bistros etc for people with long layovers. The terminal was easy to navigate but hard to find the amenities. We wasted 10 minutes in our little layover just to find a pay phone. As I finally took a break at the restroom I found them there. With very little time we rushed to our connecting flight which was a disaster! In our packed flight our gate had barely any seats. Now our gate waiting area had very little space so fine. I understand. But wait! They put in big business type seats to waste space. People were everywhere and people were sitting on the floor and standing.,2,0
chicago-midway-airport,David Guenthner,,With the new concourses it's a good domestic connecting option. Gate areas seemed clean and I could find a chair near my boarding queue. The B concourse (Southwest/ATA) is very long but there is a moving walkway down most of it. I thought the concessions were quite good but there was not enough seating in the food court area.,4,0
chicago-midway-airport,Tim Easterday,,What a nice little airport! I was flying ATL-MDW-SEA and had a couple of hours in between flights each way. Midway was very clean and easy to navigate through. Decent selection of shops too. Flights were right on time and there wasn't much taxi time at all. We were always 1st or 2nd in line for takeoff. I will gladly fly through Midway again.,,0
chicago-midway-airport,Monica Winterburn,,My daughter and I flew from Midway to Charlotte North Carolina in April 2003 and what a fantastic airport. We were very happy with the airport staff. The whole airport impressed us. Also in April 2003 we flew to Las Vegas from Midway : what a jolly crowd of passengers. We did have a delay but because all the passengers were in such a holiday mood it made the wait all that more bearable.,,0
chicago-midway-airport,Jean Bauer,,I just returned to Midway on Sunday. We decided to use the parking available there at the airport because it is very reasonable. Security however is nowhere to be found. The bus drivers do not make sure all the passengers from the parking lot is off before the departing to go home passengers come aboard. The result of this is my wallet was stolen. Welcome Home! When security was notified by me they really did not want to hear my story so I thought you might. I will never use the parking at the airport again.,,0
chicago-midway-airport,J Bruneel,,"I have to agree with the the previous two comments. I was not expecting much from Chicago's ""second airport"" but wow what a great airport. Many shops and cafes. I flew in at an early hour and most everything was open. Given a choice I would much rather fly through Midway than O'hara. Just a well done airport.",,0
chicago-midway-airport,Ivan Weiss,,"As a weekly flyer in and out of Chicago I am used to using O'hare. I went through Midway for the first time and its one of the nicest if not small airports in the US. Extremely easy to navigate eating and shopping areas are pleasant and the whole airport is very modern. It is also a snap to get to the city center on the Orange Line ""El"" train.",,0
chicago-midway-airport,Erez Har-Tal,,Just returned from a trip MDW-PHX-MDW. Wow what a change from old Midway. Chicago Midway new terminal does not even resemble the old crowded Midway airport. A lot of room around the check-in counters and in the departure hall. A large corridor that connects the departure hall with the gates area. This corridor serves as a security check-point waiting line. Very large and roomy and can accomodate easily everyone. Departed during the peak hours of 7-9 am. Large food court and decent shoping option. The new gates area is roomy with plenty of seating space. If you are unlucky to use the old gates though (Southwest still uses some of the old gates) the same old very dense area with very tired look and feel. But these are phased out gradually. When returned docked at a remote gate and had to walk quite a bit to connect to the new terminal arrival hall. Once in the arrival hall luggage carousels are quite big and not too crowded. There are security personnel that make sure before you leave that you picked the baggage that belongs to you and not someone's else. Good connection to the loop via train only $1.50. Midway is a decent less crowded alternative to O'Hare. Wish more major carriers will start serving it more often.,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,M Tonelli,United States,I departed with Delta from terminal 2 to go to Detroit to then fly to Italy via Amsterdam. Terminal two lacks in outlets and other similar amenities but I only stayed there for a short while so no need. On the return I flew United from Pisa to Chicago via Munich. The international terminal five is horrible. We arrived at peak hour and it was hopeless. There were dozens of flights from Europe and Asia that all seemed to arrive at the same time. This caused lines that stretched almost down the entire hallway just to go through passport control. After that the baggage hall was chaotic. With mountains of luggage being taken off early from the conveyor belt just to make room for more flights. The entire terminal unnavigable with the amount of craziness that was going on. There was a line that stretched through the baggage hall and all around it just to get land side. The line took an hour an if someone had any connections they wouldn't be able to catch them. If Chicago O'hare wants to be able to handle A380s and more planes they are going to need lots of renovations.,5,1
chicago-ohare-airport,William Gustin,United States,"I understand O'Hare is remarkably busy and has the weather to contend with so I do extend some grace for the reality induced by the moderately rainy day of my travel. However, the services, staff, lines, even the terminals themselves seem worn out and tired - exhausted from the constant fight-or-flight existence the airport lives under. I'll spare the details of my experience, only noting I was delayed, cancelled, and delayed again while just trying to pass through on a connector home. As I had extra time on my hands I decided to people-watch and experience the airport. People running from one place to another with frantic gazelle-like dodging and suitcases in tow. Others growing roots on burdened chairs while they wait with a hopeful stare at the stand-by list. Missed flights, pilots timing out, gate changes, and a maelstrom of reluctant airline refuges just looking for escape. Personnel were usually trying to be helpful, to their credit, but honestly inside I think they knew they were just plugging holes in the Titanic - praying to make it to the end of their shift. Problems if you need to get to the buses and shuttles. Down there, around the bend, back up an elevator? The midnight group of us were on a quest to find the final sign depicting 'Door 2.' The next day at 6.45am I returned with the hope times had improved but sure enough there were already the runners, the sitters, and the delayed flights all displaying the new day's same experiences for would-be travelers through O'hare. Does it need to be this way? O'Hare - it's time for a big disruptive change in flexible workflow and smart throughput, a desperate need for profound innovation.",1,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Bob Motto,United Kingdom,"I recently had to transit through Chicago O'Hare from American Eagle flight to a British Airways flight to London. Passengers who transit from AA to BA Transatlantic can now transfer Air Side between Terminal 3 to Terminal 5 International Departures, this means that there is no additional security to go through once you have cleared security at your original US departure airport for the domestic segment. Transer from the domestic to the international terminal took a matter of minutes & was so easy to do which meant no more rushing to get to the transit system and then go through security again. Anyone can now transfer now with ease and no stress, we just need to have the same for inbound and that will make the whole experience much more enjoyable.",9,1
chicago-ohare-airport,Bob Motto,United Kingdom,"Flew from London to Chicago with BA upon arrival in Chicago I was dreading the lines for immigration and customs, however to my surprise no lines at all! I was through immigration, customs and re-checked my luggage all within 25 minutes which is amazing. It is still a shame that there is no airside transfer between terminals but I am sure that will come as passengers who are travelling with BA to London & who transfer from a AA or American Eagle flight can now use the shuttle to transfer between terminal 3 to terminal 5 international departures. Otherwise a great experience with good facilities for passengers.",9,1
chicago-ohare-airport,Scott Bloom,United States,Easy signage. Food and quality moving to higher level. Charging stations improving. More will have to be added quickly. New airport map is available and excellent. Luggage moves quickly to luggage belts. Concourses clean. Maybe brighten or modernize to freshen up. ,9,1
chicago-ohare-airport,D Nachiket,India,The Airport terminal looks decent. But sadly it lacks facilities that even Mumbai has. Fewer charging points no free wifi. A really horrible airport.,2,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Fred Meyer,United States,"Terrible airport many flight delays because of ""weather"". De-icing policy is ridiculous. Avoid this airport unless final destination is Chicago. Try MSP as far more reliable alternative.",1,0
chicago-ohare-airport,S Jordan,United States,They are horribly organized. With delays and lost luggage common (especially when changing airlines) just avoid the airport in general. They have some cleaner restrooms but that's the only real positive to them it seems. Limited food choices long distances between terminals with no easy way to get between them. Just avoid this airport.,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Elizabeth Stirling,United States,"Just flew home to O'Hare yesterday afternoon. The customs experience was fine using the kiosks. But then you must deal with people. A woman shouted at me to go to number 43! I looked at that station and there was a man there with no passengers so I went straight to his booth. He screamed at me ""I did not call you"". I picked up my passport and papers and began to retreat at which point he said ""Come here!"" I told him the woman had directed me to his booth but he said again ""I did not call you!"" He then began to ask me a series of questions in a loud angry tone. Welcome home to Chicago!",5,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Victor Mang'Era,United States,Very slow and long trip to the trains. Food options are limited and expensive. Signage poor and confusing. Security staff too busy chatting and joking amongst themselves instead of doing their job and clearing big queues. It could be different to US citizens though but definitely an airport to avoid. Plus you have to have to clear and check in your luggage. I missed my connection.,4,0
chicago-ohare-airport,P Ostaszewski,Poland,I've travelled about 10 times to the US this year it was a nightmare. We flew into O'Hare on Saturday 19th July 2014. The queue for passport control was incredible long - they were told that it would be more than a 3 hour wait and it turned out to be a total nightmare for us. O'Hare is incredibly badly organised. We asked if there was a separate line for families with kids but it was not. The people who were controlling the traffic were rude. How do you wait with two children under 10 (one 14 months old) in a queue that long after a 9 hour transatlantic flight? Dreadful. This is not the first time they or we have experienced long queues of this nature at O'Hare. Nothing seems to be done about it - why?,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Andrew Middleton,United Kingdom,Immigration for non US citizens at this airport has always been bad but our last visit in July 2014 took us 2.5 hours. There were only two booths open to serve a massive snaking queue. Often they would stop to chat just to keep us all waiting a bit longer. It's not about security it's just an opportunity for big brother to treat you as they please. And there's nothing you can do about it. They love giving passengers a hard time because that is there mindset. Welcome to the USA!,5,0
chicago-ohare-airport,D Parker,United Kingdom,My daughter and three little grand-daughters flew into O'Hare (they live in Chicago) late on Friday 8th August 2014. The queue for passport control was ridiculously long - they were told that it would be a 3 hour wait as 10000 passengers on 25 flights had turned up around the same time. It turned out to be a total nightmare for them. O'Hare is incredibly badly organised. How do you wait with three children under 7 (one 4 years old) in a queue that long after an 8.5 hour transatlantic flight? Dreadful. This is not the first time they or we have experienced long queues of this nature at O'Hare. Nothing seems to be done about it - why?,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Matthew Zhang,United States,Flew to O'Hare on a trip from Lubbock-Beijing. The American Airlines Terminal is very large and takes a long time to get from one gate to another the terminal however has a good selection of facilities and is quite clean. The check in was actually pretty fast and the counter agents were helpful security however is the other way around the lines are very long and slow the staff working at security are rude and aren't very helpful. Not a good airport for accessibility but has a good selection of food and retail services.,6,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Alexander Johnston,United Kingdom,"My wife my daughter and I flew into O'Hare in 2012 in order to go to a wedding. Admittedly our flight was late departing from Heathrow but when we arrived at O'Hare we had about 2 hours to spare before the departure of our connecting flight. That however wasn't enough time to get us through security and customs. We missed our connection. The information available was poor and only a few clearance desks were staffed. Our requests to be fast-tracked fell on deaf ears. My wife and I are both elderly and we had to stand for about an hour and a half in an over-heated terminal building as the ""snake"" slowly moved forward. We enjoyed our stay but I'm not going through that again.",,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Richard Pepper,United Kingdom,"Flew Heathrow to Chicago then onward to Omaha. This required claiming baggage passing through customs and immigration then handing over baggage and transferring terminal. Fair enough but it would have been better if the people collecting the luggage for the onward flight weren't just piling it in a corner (not exactly what you expect in these hyper-security conscious times) one of the shuttle trains hadn't been out of action and a TSA agent who decided that he wasn't happy with the location of the desk and adjusted it by less than an inch before every passenger. I think my colleague ticked him off by standing about 6 inches past his sign saying ""wait here to be called forward"" so he was making a point to slow everyone down. Very petty and a great first impression for my first trip to the US. Fortunately everyone else we met was lovely! Terminal 1 is pretty big with lots of small kiosks and a few sit down places but lacks proper eating places as are found in Heathrow Gatwick Edinburgh etc.. Flying back we wanted dinner but could only really get a snack.",4,0
chicago-ohare-airport,B Aldridge,United States,O'Hare is enormous and always busy but in spite of that it is well organized. The signage is clear and easy to understand. The security line which may look daunting at first moves quickly. Once through any domestic security checkpoint you can access all domestic terminals (1-3). There is a wide variety of places to eat and drink or grab something quick at a broad range of prices. While not a shopping mall like many newer airports there are plenty of places to shop and browse. The Blue line train is an inexpensive and reliable way to get to or from downtown Chicago or its neighborhoods. I use O'Hare regularly and find it as tolerable as any airport - none of which I would describe as pleasant places to spend time. The main complaint I hear is from non-US citizens arriving at the International Terminal (Terminal 5) waiting in very long lines. I have experienced long lines when arriving as a non-citizen at airports around the world so this does not appear to be a problem unique to O'Hare.,8,1
chicago-ohare-airport,Emily Borowski,United States,"My experience was pleasant flying from ORD's newly remodelled Terminal 5. No hassles through TSA on the way out and no headaches coming back in. The new shops are lovely but pricey and it was fun passing time in the duty free shop. We did not encounter any rude or indifferent employees. What I liked best about my return through ORD is the passport control process. While the traditional process is still available for US Passports they also offer (at no cost) kiosks that get you through the process much quicker. The kiosks are in the room after TSA's ""Trusted a Traveler"" portals; I made the mistake of trying one of those out first. Baggage and customs were a breeze too. So ORD is now my first choice if I'm flying international.",10,1
chicago-ohare-airport,S Symon,France,I travelled on AA connecting from CDG and then transferring from Terminal 5 to Terminal 3 on an American Eagle flight to BWI. I was extremely nervous even though I had 2 hours to connect. I was amazed that it took me just 30 minutes to pass through immigration customs and security! Since my transatlantic leg was 40 minutes ahead of schedule I was ready for my next flight before my first flight was even scheduled to land. Although the connections process was seamless and efficient Terminal 3's L concourse is pretty dark and dreary and the facilities are nothing to write home about. Overall a positive experience.,8,1
chicago-ohare-airport,C Denson,United Kingdom,A chaotic and unpleasant experience I wouldn't want to repeat unless I had to. Very slow journey to and from airport on train to centre. Food options in terminal 5 very limited and expensive. Signage around airport very poor and confusing. Security staff too busy chatting and joking amongst themselves instead of doing their job and clearing big queues.,2,0
chicago-ohare-airport,B Becker,United States,Read many of the reviews here and agree to avoid this airport at all costs especially if flying International and connecting to a domestic flight. I was very lucky to get through Immigration-Customs in about 20 mins just happened to be at the right place and time but I did notice behind me a very long line which I believe was for Non US citizens. I was lucky to get through Customs in the amount of time I did and I barely made my flight (had 1.5 hrs). Also the staff here seem to be very impersonal and not friendly - a sharp difference when you travel throughout Asia and Australia where them seem more willing to help. Unfortunate as for many visitors to the U.S. this will be their first impression and maybe their last. Terminal 5 and Terminal 1 seem to have plenty of Restaurant and shopping choices. Also the structure seemed to be updated. But didn't have much time here and was running from landing at Terminal 5 to catch my connection to Terminal 1. You have to take a train from Terminal 5 to the Domestic Terminals (keep in mind you also have to recheck baggage if landing here first coming from International) so if you have 2 hrs it may be just enough time.,1,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Ted Funk,United States,ORD is one of the world's busiest airports in terms of both passengers and aircraft movements so it is to be expected problems might arise. I've been flying in and out of here for over 30 years and I love the place. Food? Depends where you go: Terminals 1 and 3 are pretty good but Terminal 2 could use improvements and Terminal 5 has a long way to go. United and American Airlines are in terminals 1 and 3 respectively which explains why those have the best offerings. The security lines aren't all that bad and I find the customs officials to be pretty good. Also ORD is fairly clean something that most airports of its size and stature are not.,10,1
chicago-ohare-airport,L Hammersmith,United Kingdom,U.S. Citizens were let through immigration in minutes the rest of us were kept waiting for 3 hours. We missed our connection of course. What was truly offensive though was the lack of attention paid to this second group only two booths were open (in contrast to 6 for citizens) and the officials had seemingly no concern for the steadily lengthening line. Amazingly they would exit the booths to chat. I've never been treated this way in a U.S airport before. Shocking.,3,0
chicago-ohare-airport,M Estrella,United States,Yes it is huge with incredible crowds but terminals were relatively efficient and the lines relatively short. Only problem I had was with a car starter at cab company who seemed to have no empathy for someone who was not familiar enough with the airport to realize that there is no Terminal 4. Other than that the ground staff were very nice.,7,1
chicago-ohare-airport,DS Rajan,United Kingdom,Four hour wait to get through immigration so missed my connecting flight. Absolutely useless - no queue management or information small children crying. Most emerging market airports are far superior.,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,V Heyes,United Kingdom,The immigration performance at terminal 5 is the worst I have experienced anywhere in the world in my 30 years as a frequent international traveller. I landed at 2.10 pm joined the long line for non US immigration at 2.25 pm and was finally processed at 4.45 pm. There were only 3 immigration booths open for non US travellers whilst many more were open for residents and US citizens. The staff managing the lines were most unhelpful and bullied people along in a brusque manner. There were families with young children elderly people clearly uncomfortable with the delay. At first I thought I was unlucky on this particular day but frequent visitors in the line told me this was pretty true to form. I am a frequent traveller to the USA and I can honestly say I have never had more than 40 minutes to wait at immigration at other international airports. If indeed this performance is typical I will make it a point in future never to come in again through O'Hare on an inbound international flight. Baggage of course had been taken off the belt and it took me another 10 minutes finding my bags with no signage nor anyone there to ask. The delay meant I missed my pre-booked shuttle to downtown and had to pay again for a taxi. All in all the experience was extremely poor.,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,R Locke,United Kingdom,First time out of O'Hare and as a British passport holder we are normally good as a Nation for complaining. But my experience as a full fare paying First Class ticket holder on United Airlines out of Terminal One was just plain disgusting. Never seen so many uninterested employees. Self check-in when you have paid for a First Class ticket should be an experience above the normal but here no. United have no policy to make you feel different whether you are. Coach or first? No disrespect to Coach my normal travel would be by that means but just on this occasion I provided what I thought would be nice experience. So no directions given when I checked in no mention that the First Class lounge was closed for refurb. So now with meal voucher and a couple of drinks vouchers I'm back down to Coach level facilities. I might as well purchased a day ticket for the United Club and saved $3000 on the airfare. Truly a well deserved low level expectation airline matched by an equally poor and run down airport. Avoid UA and avoid O'Hare most of all avoid any First Class with UA because they see you no different from any other Coach passenger.,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,C Hepworth,United Kingdom,I fly though O'Hare 2 or 3 times a year I have never had to long to wait at customs / immigration this year I have only had to wait 30 minutes each time the TSA are friendly and polite any cuts caused by the sequester seem to have been absorbed well I see less TSA people sat round (probably on a break) then before the cuts I have not had any problems at the airport over the years the terminal is always clean and tidy. Departures at T5 at O'Hare has had a major upgrade in July the old lines have gone and you now go though a bigger and faster screening area they also found room to include a large duty free area after you pass security there is a surprise! This seems to be where the old food court used to be all the food courts that were on the upper level at T5 are now airside and the prices seem to be a little lower than last year. T5 is the best of all the terminals at O'Hare since it is smaller then the others so there is less walking time to get around it the car parks are just outside and Coach USA are outside every hour they offer good value travel (go their web site to see where they go) the train to other terminals comes around every 10 minutes and takes a few minutes to get to T2 the roads around the airport can be confusing but that can be said about most airports.,10,1
chicago-ohare-airport,J Body,United Kingdom,We flew home from here after a recent holiday. We had flown out of London Heathrow and found the contrast quite surprising. Upon arrival we self checked our bags which was fairly straightforward. We were then unsure which way to go for security. One member of staff directed us to the wrong place but we eventually found where to go. There was a long queue although it did move reasonably quickly - it probably took about 15 minutes. One thing that surprised us was that under 12s or over 70s did not need to remove their shoes for security checks - surely if someone is a risk everyone is a potential risk no matter their age? Once on the concourse we were unsure where to go and wait. There is basically a long corridor with a few shops and nowhere to sit other than the departure gates. We therefore had 3 hours to kill and not a lot to fill the time with. I would have happily browsed a shopping area and probably spent some money on last minutes gifts. It also felt odd having no designated sitting area prior to our gate being open. Not a user friendly airport considering the amount of time you need to spend there.,3,0
chicago-ohare-airport,H Brooks,United States,Today was my first trip to O'Hare in nearly 20 years. I've avoided it like the plague always opting for Midway when having to fly to a Chicago for a reason. Too big too inconvenient too impersonal. Today I had no choice and I was curious to see if it had changed. It hasn't except for appearing more crowded and run down than I remember. I always liked Chicago for the friendliness of its people but I can only assume that most of the people who work at O'Hare are not from this area. Unsmiling tired looking indifferent employees who seem pained to have to engage with you. They all look like they hate their jobs and why wouldn't they? If I had to work here and have to deal with these same people on a day to day basis I'd be unhappy too. Back to Midway at any cost! BTW I am only talking about a Terminals 1 and 2 United's terminals. The others might be great - I wouldn't know.,3,0
chicago-ohare-airport,J Becker,United States,I really have no problem with O'Hare. It's a mess getting to the airport but traffic is hardly their fault. There's wifi here and outlets spread around. The food's not that great but it's an airport. I always breeze through security so I don't really have a problem. Employees seem very friendly especially for Chicago. I think this place gets a bad rap.,8,1
chicago-ohare-airport,Paranj Kalyani,United States,I've been through this airport twice now (transferring from domestics to international the first time and from international to domestic the second time). My first experience was decent; not bad not enjoyable. This airport is very confusing and cumbersome to navigate and the staff is not very approachable. The train system is a good addition though. Not much to do here if you have a long layover. Inadequate dining options and it is hell to find an electric outlet for charging needs. Some bathrooms are very dirty. The second time around this airport made my life a living hell. I had been traveling for almost 30 hours and when I landed here I was greeted by a long immigration line. Took almost an hour and a half to clear immigration all the while putting up with the extremely rude and seemingly arrogant staff. You get treated like vermin here. Baggage claim was smooth and I was happy to get out of the airport. This airport is so bad that it has made me question my decision of flying Etihad (which is a great airline) just because all their planes flying to the US initially land here! Avoid unless necessary.,1,0
chicago-ohare-airport,A Yorath,United Kingdom,I am a British citizen and have visited Chicago many many times over the past 20 years and usually felt welcome. However this fine city is now totally let down by the incompetent management of arrivals procedures at O'Hare Terminal 5. The reality that I experienced on arrival into O'Hare T5 on September 24 was anything but welcoming. There was a 2 hour line for immigration followed by indifferent/rude airport and airline employees in the baggage claim area. Ironically in the weeks before this visit Chicago was being promoted as a welcoming tourist destination in commercials on UK TV networks. I fully understand that the Mayor's tourism dept. does not control the activities of Dept. of Homeland Security or airline employees and while I can respect that immigration procedures are very necessary for the security of US borders it is completely ridiculous to use resources to promote the city in overseas TV markets but then not adequately resource immigration procedures to facilitate those visits. Right now flying into O'Hare T5 = undesirable experience.,2,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Ramon Sando,Mexico,This is by far the most disorganized airport visited in my life long lines everywhere slow and rude officers no air conditioning dirty bathrooms.,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Colin Gorman,United Kingdom,Flew DUB-ORD-SNA and on this occasion ORD was a breeze to connect to onward flight as I had already pre-cleared Customs/INS at DUB (AA Flight) so it arrived at T3 (Domestic) and only had to walk about 6-8 gates for next flight also from T3 whole process only took about 15mins which beats hands down the 3hrs plus you can normally expect at ORD for INS/Customs/Transfers etc.,5,1
chicago-ohare-airport,D Ash,United States,Good points: Automatic toilets - seat covers change automatically. Conveniently located. More flights compared to midway airport - more options and flexibility. Bad points: Very rude careless anti-social airport staff. TSA agents as someone said bark at you. International ticketing agents are mostly good. Confusing directions to terminals ticketing areas and parking lots. Insufficient announcements on gate changes and inadequate seating in front of many gates. Insufficient charging outlets. No free Wi-Fi and customer service for missed flights and cancellation inadequate. Have to wait hours to re-book flights. Delays to go through immigration and catch connecting flights. Chaotic. Parking close to terminals $50 a day. Old and smelly underpasses connecting terminals.,4,1
chicago-ohare-airport,Ken Jenkins,United Kingdom,It has got to be the most disorganised airport I have been through. We landed at the international terminal and went through immigration and customs and made our way to the domestic terminal to catch our next flight. It was only because we had a rough idea of where to go from a previous experience that we got to the front of the queue to go through security into the domestic terminal. Two lines were open of about 15 lines checking passports and hand luggage. Shortly after we got to this stage there must have been at least 150 people behind us. I am certain some of these poor people must have missed their connections. 3 years previous we had 1.45 hours to do the same thing and missed our connection because there were not enough security lines open. We sat in the airport for 8 hours waiting for a flight. Allowing time for immigration customs trekking to the other end of the airport and going through the inefficient security gates you require at least 4 hours. The last flight to come home was very disorganised we changed gates twice and no one seemed to know what they were doing. After all this I don't suppose any one will take any notice.,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,G DeVerteuil,United Kingdom,Flew into ORD July 5 and returned to UK on 13 July. Was pleasantly surprised by speed of customs/immigration at T5 around 10am as I was able to use the 'Green Card' line as a Canadian citizen. Very quick connection to Blue Line and into Chicago. On way back flew out of T1 very disappointed with the sole duty free shop - ridiculous!,6,1
chicago-ohare-airport,Jim Jackson,United States,I have flown internationally many many times but only through San Francisco. This week my wife and I had to go through Chicago's O'Hare and it was horrible! For some reason the people that run the immigration and customs have decided to automate the process yet they still had bungling fools directing people and checking documents. The people checking documents who we assumed were immigration officers had no clue. The immigration people took our customs paperwork which are usually taken by the customs officers after you get your baggage. Several immigration officers had piles of them on their check-in desks. At immigration they make you go to a computer that scans your passport then takes your photo. If you are travelling with someone it takes theirs along with yours. We then get a major surprise: one officer is checking everyone's baggage all 300 of us from the flight from Germany! The line is very long and very slow. I can only imagine some older couple getting extremely stressed out by this process.,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Kevin Focke,United States,The lack of outlets for charging accessories is absolutely ridiculous in 2013 every location to grab a drink had no availability. Airport needs a serious update.,1,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Mike Chamberlain,United Kingdom,Just flown international out of Terminal 5. The facilities in the departure lounge are almost non-existent. There is a small Korean cafe a Mexican cafe with small bar and two bar carts. Apart from buying sandwiches and soft drinks from shops these are the only means of eating and drinking. Nothing warns you about the lack of facilities before you go through security. When you complain you are just told that other facilities will be available at the end of the year. This is of no help when you are looking for a meal. The two small cafes are so busy that they are now doing take-aways. It says it all when there are very limited facilities for eating and drinking but there is a large duty free shop.,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,S Tomblin,United States,We recently flew into O'Hare airport when we arrived from Charlotte NC. We had a late night arrival. So late that nearly everything was closed. The restrooms thankfully were not and they were spotless. We were able to Locate the Blue line to get to our destination. A man helped us to figure out what to do once we got there. On our departure from Chicago we were able to print our boarding passes pass through screening and the ticketing area in about 15 minutes. There were many food vendors and stores we could buy food from and we even saw that you could get a massage. We had to wait about an hour but it was not an unpleasant wait. The NSA staff and airport staff were all pleasant and helpful.,10,1
chicago-ohare-airport,N Brown,United States,Very old very outdated very antiquated. The long lines the shuttling between terminals the lack of plugs for cell phones and lap tops and the rude staff was enough to make me never go through there again. Please update this tacky monstrosity and modernize it.,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,J Becker,United States,Generally I complain about Chicago's airports but this time I had no issues. Staff was quick and efficient and I was able to be through everything very rapidly. Luggage was quick and waiting for me upon my return no problems at all. Food choice could be better.,7,1
chicago-ohare-airport,S Hirst,Canada,Terminal 5 is an absolute nightmare for non US travelers. United booked my flight with a 1.5 hrs connection. Flying out there was a uniformed man who called passengers off our flight to a free immigration booth after waiting for half an hour. Since there were many hundreds of people jammed into the immigration hall we would never have made our flight. Coming back no such luck. After waiting for 45 minutes in the incredible line up which appeared to consist of a thousand people I pleaded with the girl directing US residents and she let me into this line. After picking up my luggage and re checking with united I had twenty minutes to get to terminal 2 before my flight left. I still had to go through security in terminal 2. I made it just but my baggage didn't. How can they possibly justify having two customs officials to deal with this enormous number of people.,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Stuart Ward,United Kingdom,We passed through this airport twice in a week once from UK and then from Mexico. On both occasions we were met by huge queues for passport check both times taking 2-3 hours to get through. As we made our way towards immigration we were ordered by a young lady to 'stand against the wall' get against the wall'. We queued there for about 45 minutes before getting to a hall best described as a cattle market crammed with hundreds of visitors. People were taking photos of the unbelievable crowd. Only about 1/3 of passport desks were manned. It took 2 hours to get through the queue plus the 45 minutes in the corridor. Many people were missing connecting flights. When they asked staff what they should do they were rudely told 'stand in line there's nothing you can do you just have to catch the next one'. I guess for some that meant spending the night in the terminal. One parent tried to offer food to their bored child only to be ordered to 'put that food away- no food' because they were using sniffer dogs. There was not a hint of courtesy politeness or helpfulness in any of the staff. US citizens seemed to be getting through in about 15 minutes. This was obviously not an isolated incident since it was the same on both occasions we passed through. This is the worst airport I have ever passed through. They should not be allowed to take international flights if they think it is reasonable to treat the passengers this way.,1,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Neill Ward,United Kingdom,We arrived from UK with about an hour to get off the British Airways flight get through immigration collect our cases hand them in again and get to the next terminal by the transit train. As we taxied to a stop the pilot said all those with immediate connecting flights would find an orange envelope on the wall when we got to the end of the airbridge just wave this as we went through the airport and we be rushed through. I have to say it all worked like clockwork. As we approached immigration a lady directed us into a short queue of about ten people. (The main queue snaked around for several hundred yards). We were through in about ten minutes and although our luggage with the red labels came after numerous ones without we found the new bag drop counter and jumped on the train to the next terminal. Our flight boarded whilst luggage was still turning up on the tarmac but when we arrived at New Orleans. The success of this was due to having both flights booked by BA so they were responsible for getting us to the final destination. From previous reports I had read of Chicago I had no faith in making New Orleans on this last flight of the night so I can only say thanks to BA and the staff at Chicago for making the experience efficient and pleasurable.,9,1
chicago-ohare-airport,W Wallace,United Kingdom,Arrived at O'Hare from London yesterday to face longest immigration line that I've ever seen in many years of travelling worldwide. In essence it took me 3 hours of waiting to be processed! Yes I repeat 3 hours! I can only say that I was appalled to be treated so badly. Is this the way to treat visitors to the US who are a vital source of revenue for the country? I love Chicago and the US but was very disappointed by the complete disregard for visitors shown by US Immigration management. The solution is simple: employ more people and have sufficient staff on at busy times. The people who were in that line yesterday all went away with a very bad impression and will no doubt avoid flying into Chicago in the future.,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,D Jette,United States,Got to airport 2.5 hrs early for an early evening American Airlines flight to Tampa. T3 security was good (got through in 20 minutes) but our gate (K1) has virtually no seating. Gate is located right outside security but there were less than 50 seats at the gate which is typically used for mainline flights. Most other gates have sufficient seating however. There is a decent choice of food but the majority of it is (at least in T3) located in a food court where Conc. H and K split off from each other and could possibly be a 5 minute walk to the food court not to mention the wait to get your food.,5,0
chicago-ohare-airport,M Tong,Singapore,I read all the recent reviews and thought ORD would be horrendous but contrary to the reviews the airport worked well! My family of 4 arrived in T5 on Sunday 30 Dec 2012 afternoon after more than an hour's delay in Heathrow London due to a technical fault with the aircraft and half expected to miss our flight connection as our original transit time was only 3 hr. Well we got through Immigration in 45 mins (we are all non-US citizens) retrieved our luggage from the carousel without a hitch and passed them to the United Airlines staff waiting there. We got to Concourse C for our flight to Atlanta albeit with only 20 mins before scheduled flight time. We didn't meet any unhelpful or brusque staff and we were pleasantly surprised that the airport's transfer systems (for luggage and passengers) all worked as they ought. As a bonus the airport also has a good choice of dining places plus the fun brachiosaurus in Concourse B.,8,1
chicago-ohare-airport,Agata Staniak,United States,The worst airport I have transited through. If you're coming to the USA through this airport and you're not a citizen or a green card holder - avoid. I transited through this airport twice and each time the wait at immigration was over 2 hours. If you don't want to miss a connecting flight you need at least a 4 hours layover to be on the safe side. I missed a flight and the airport personnel refused to help me to make it on time.,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,H Lee,United States,Flown into Terminal 3 and then waited for others at Terminal 1/2. Although it is not a fault of anyone this airport is just unreliable especially in the winter anyone can lose connections due to delays that can be triggered not just by snowfalls but also by mere rains coupled with low visibility. I was affected by exactly that and ended up arriving at O'Hare an hour late. Airport's location itself is already a reason to avoid this airport especially for connections. The airport offers a cheap rail link into the downtown in addition to the expressway option and considering the frequent congestion's on the expressways around Chicago sometimes the metro option is a must for travelers. Except for T5 - the international terminal - the other terminals are also nicely grouped together in the central terminal area so walking over to a different terminal is not that difficult at all there is a free and efficient Airport Transit System that links all terminals and the remote parking lots. The terminal facilities however can have some upgrades to be more appealing. Airside had seating available for passengers around each gate but landside had a very limited number of benches. The wifi was not free and even when I wanted to pay for it the signal was not even strong. The power ports were virtually non-existent. Flight information displays were lacking both in terms of its quality and its size. Information was incorrect for some delayed flights. Some flight information was not even clear as to which terminal they were expected to depart/arrive many first-timers would be in trouble finding their ways to the correct terminal/gates. Other aspects of evaluation seem to be on par with or slightly worse than most other major airports in my opinion. In short I would discourage others from flying in and out of ORD unless it is unavoidable (e.g. Chicago is their final destination). Except for the superior availability of flight options from United and American I would always choose other major hubs over ORD.,4,0
chicago-ohare-airport,J McCough,United States,The Immigration at Chicago O'Hare is an embarrassment for both Chicago and USA. The level of service has declined to the point that it took us over one hour to clear immigration - I have flown in and out of O'Hare since 1971. In Terminal 5 there are 34 lanes on each of two sides. Of the 34 lanes about 5-6 were manned for Visitors while 1-3 were manned for Residents. One of the agents decided to take a 30 minute break while several hundred of us waited in line to clear immigration; leaving only 2 agents plus the one agent handling the Global Entry lane. When military personnel filled one of the lanes - not a complaint - that left one lane for the remaining hundreds of passengers. When the agent told the young woman keeping order not to sent anymore people to his lane that left zero lanes! Finally one of the 5-10 agents who were standing in the hallway opened a new lane and the women returned from her break. It was so bad that many of us requested to talk to a supervisor - he or she never came out. I would avoid Chicago O'Hare if I was traveling to the USA and had other choices.,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Richard Hodges,United Kingdom,After my earlier positive review (10 Oct) about coming IN to Chicago and then an internal flight to Savannah from O'Hare on another day we did the O'Hare - London Heathrow return. Whilst not quite as horrendous as we were told when in the security queue (2 x-ray/security machines for the whole of International / Terminal 5 departures? Really?) that there were no restaurants past security. So we found something dreadful to eat at what passes for the truly laughable 'food court' in Terminal 5. Then found some much more acceptable offerings when we got through security. The International Departures part of Terminal 5 Chicago O'Hare is fairly grim (and that is putting it mildly). All I can say is get something to eat before you get to Terminal 5 and take a good book / Kindle. There's nothing to do after Security. Come on Chicago - you're a great city - have an International Airport that matches.,5,0
chicago-ohare-airport,R Newcombe,United Kingdom,We were delayed 2 hours at immigration with long queues of tired passengers. The staff marshalling us into the lines were not interested in providing any comfort or words to ease the frustration. The immigration officials were slow and limited in number to make things worse I realise that the staff were merely doing their jobs and cannot be expected to hurry up the process so I blame the management of the area and the processes involved. If this situation is a continuing one then surely some way of improving the process more staff at peak times for example should be used. The stats for arrivals are no secret the airlines know the figures so why don't the immigration department official do something about it. Or maybe nobody really cares whether we visit again or not!,5,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Carl Gustav,Sweden,Terminal 5 (international) at O'hare is one of the worst places to fly out of. The facilities including places to eat are limited to a duty free shop souvenir shop and 3 fast food restaurants and a small Bar that surround a depressing seating area. The security checkpoint is very slow and on a busy day you could end up standing in line for over an hour. After the security there are no restaurants or fast food places whatsoever. Just a couple of kiosks and news stands. The domestic terminals at O'hare are way better and have tons of options for food etc so it's surprising that they don't try to make the international terminal a bit more accommodating.,2,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Hunter Bigham,United States,Absolutely no working electrical outlets in T3 Concourse G. I tried eight gates and could not fine any live outlets. Seems like a small thing but delays and cancelled flights mean you need computers and phones longer. I could get no work complete because my batteries died while awaiting a flight.,3,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Richard Hodges,United Kingdom,After awful reviews of O'Hare it was with some trepidation that I flew Heathrow - O'Hare and O'hare to Savannah. Whilst we did have to wait a while to get through passport control security baggage retrieval etc we were at our downtown hotel within 2 hours of landing. And whilst not exactly service with a smile it wasn't the worst experience either (Newark hang your head in shame). O'Hare to Savannah was a breeze on a busy Monday am - smiley helpful check in staff and very nice security people. Not much to do when through security but at least there's a variety of eating places. Not what I was expecting.,7,1
chicago-ohare-airport,Ole Troelso,Denmark,I landed and had two hours to connect. Barely made it and only because I had no checked luggage. There were 3 lines at immigration. The busiest was for transit passengers and this had the fewest staff 3 inspectors and one was missing several times. I was standing in line with hundreds of people all getting more and more desperate as they were transit passengers and many needed to get on with it. Why did the supervisor not shift some of the passengers to the green card line which was moving at a good pace? They did not do that before the green card line was completely empty. Will do my best to avoid Chicago in the future!,1,0
chicago-ohare-airport,S Watson,United Kingdom,No signs anywhere 3 hours to go through immigration filthy toilets and staff who obviously couldn't care less. I will make a serious effort to never see this place again.,1,0
chicago-ohare-airport,P Goddard,United Kingdom,When we arrived on a flight from LHR there was a long walk to immigration. Luckily the flight before us had just about gone through and we were one of the first people off the plane so we got through in about 10 minutes. After clearing everything and at the exit there were no signs to where the Car Rental Shuttles are and there was no one about to ask. For our return flight the walkways around check-in were very narrow and congested. The queue for security was very long with a wait for about 20 minutes with 2 lanes for 'normal' people and 1 lane for business/first class. The staff just waved their fingers at you without even looking at you. Airside there are no restaurants and the only place you can get food from is a small open shop. At the gate there is also few seats lots of the passengers sat on the floor.,5,0
chicago-ohare-airport,J Fissore,United States,Facilities are disastrous (filthy/dirty restrooms malfunctioning AC system even broken escalators) security officers have no respect to passengers whatsoever staff in general are rude delays occur all the time (even at 7am when there are only 3 planes on the runways). There is almost no gate or flight information public transportation is a joke and you often have to walk long distances to reach the correct gate. The only redeeming value is the quality and variety of eateries offered. In short O'Hare is a disgrace to the city of Chicago.,2,0
chicago-ohare-airport,H Melby,Norway,"An absolutely horrible airport to transit through especially if you're coming off a domestic flight (in my case Denver) and transiting to Europe. I got off the plane and there was absolutely no information anywhere about where to go. I had to walk all the way to one end of the terminal to find a flight overview but those were only for that particular terminal and hence terminal and gate information for next flight was not on there. I had to ask for help at a random gate (where I had to say ""excuse me"" 4 times before any of the employees bothered looking at me). I was eventually directed towards terminal 5. After getting to terminal 5 which was a bit of a project in itself the line for security clearance stretched for about 100 meters without any organization whatsoever. In line I talked to some people who were going on the same flight who had had the exact same issues as well. The staff are also the rudest I have ever encountered even against the people standing in the business/first class line. No matter how good of a stay you might have had in the US this airport will almost not make you want to return anytime soon. In summary a poorly organized airport with a horribly rude staff. Avoid transiting through this airport. If you have no other choice make sure to at the very least have 2 hours between flights.",1,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Juliana Madrone,United States,I will try to never fly through Chicago again. Everyone I have met here has been rude! Except for one security gentleman as we left customs to go to another terminal a gentleman whose service and kind attitude really stands out against everyone else's amazing rudeness. Even the ladies in our first class lounge who couldn't explain to me how it works as it's my first time in such a lounge but instead treated me with curt responses and no niceties. I am returning home from overseas and am really tired already. This kind of treatment is undignified and absolutely unacceptable.,2,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Simon Castleman,United Kingdom,Nearly 2 hours in immigration 4 people manning 15 channels don't they know there are wide bodied jets inbound with passengers. I use to come through ORD 3-6 times per year and its getting worse. Barely had enough time to make my connection and then when I get to terminal 1 the security queues are taking 40 minutes to process and that was the premium channel. A bad advert for the US and worse for O'Hare. If you have the option don't enter the US via Chicago.,1,0
chicago-ohare-airport,S Huffman,United States,This process is very broken. They had two lines US visitors and US citizens Canadians and people with Green Cards. The issue was very simple the US Citizens flew by and could have been processed in matter of seconds. The people with Green Cards had to go through a lengthy interrogation. Take a hint from grocery stores - for the people with the fewest items open an express line. I waited in line for 1.5 hours to take 2 minutes to process.,1,0
chicago-ohare-airport,S Fortes,United Kingdom,This airport needs to do something about its immigration and customs officers. After arriving on a slightly delayed fight from Manchester and despite the best efforts of American Airlines agents in giving out priority passes we missed a connecting flight. Firstly the immigration officer managed to mess up the finger printing on mine and my wife's passports and with a curt' you can come in' to me 'but she can't to my wife accompanied by a pointed finger. I tried to explain to him what had happened but he was not interested and we had to go and sit in a room with other none desirables. On speaking to a supervisor the problem was sorted out. Next was the customs officer after we were directed the wrong way he proceeded to shout and point at us in front of many other people I suspect this was the first time he has worn a uniform and has been in a position of power if this is the welcome you can expect on arrival at Chicago the I will avoid flying there at any cost. On our return flight they managed to direct us to the wrong terminal and only just made our flight thankfully the passport control officers were much more efficient and polite. On return to Manchester we saw how much more polite our immigration officers were to visiting US passport holders.,1,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Willerslev-Legrand,United Kingdom,It is normal to wait 2-3 hours at immigration which is very tiresome when you have already travelled for many hours. There is a total lack of security officers and obviously little or no organization. The management says it is a question of security but in reality it is impossible to hide how badly organized O'Hare immigrations is.,2,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Gerhard Tillmann,Germany,The longest wait at immigrations I have ever experienced: over 3 hours. For a while only one booth was staffed for hundreds of people standing in line including mothers with children elderly persons in frail physical condition. Many missed their connecting flights. A nightmare.,3,0
chicago-ohare-airport,C Maryon,United States,2.5 hours immigration queue delay with 3 staff manning the area sometimes only 2 staff. With 400 or so people waiting this is very tiring and time consuming after a long flight. I understand that safety and security are vital but a few more staff present might have speeded up events at immigration. It seemed that the staff do not work as a team very well as we are asked to stand here then another person says no stand over there in that queue. Upon leaving the US the process was much faster and the staff seemed more friendly. Other than that I had a great vacation.,5,1
chicago-ohare-airport,Pablo Martino,United States,Have stood in line more than once to get through security for over an hour. They almost always have half the lanes closed and force customers to stand in line. Security personnel have grouchy looks on their face do not say hello do not smile and bark commands at you like you're a dog. Absolutely horrible!,1,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Indranil Chakrabarty,Australia,United terminal is modern. Policemen on the beat can be rude unfriendly and downright intimidating. ORD staff are generally friendly. International arrivals hall a dump. CTA station to Cumberland is on the lower level and is nice and clean. I prefer travelling to the loop/North Michigan Avenue on the EL train. Report at least 4 hrs early for check-in.,8,1
chicago-ohare-airport,Ramon Fretz,Switzerland,In transit from Zurich to Minneapolis via ORD. An ordeal. Long waiting lines at Terminal 5 for immigration. Very slow security process in Terminal 1 for my connecting flight. Connecting time was just sufficient to get from plane to plane just in time (almost 3 hours). Lack of efficiency makes ORD a bad place to connect. The only nice thing were the friendly people at immigration and security.,3,0
chicago-ohare-airport,T May,United States,Stopped here with United on my way to Roanoke (ROA) from San Francisco (SFO). This is the one to avoid. When I landed the plane took 20 mins to taxi to the gate because of the terribly organized runways. I came to find that although the terminal (Terminal 1) was clean and had plenty of eateries most were too expensive. After passing that little conglomerate eateries are next to none so it took awhile to find a decently-priced place. Finding a restroom was nightmare. I had to find Terminal 2 which took even longer than the restroom thanks to an appalling lack of signage. Terminal 2 was far too small to hold all the passengers necessary and indirectly because of that it was appallingly dirty. The flight to Roanoke got caught in traffic. There is no next time for this airport I'll use Midway if I have to.,3,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Angelo Tzarevski,South Africa,Security (as with any US airport) takes a while and there are usually long lines. Shops and restaurants are very limited (even at T5 the international terminal). Transfer between terminals means that you need to clear immigration and customs and either take the bus or the monorail train which means that you then need to go through TSA security again. Facilities are nothing special and the terminals are generally long and narrow hence no sense of spaciousness.,7,1
chicago-ohare-airport,John Bolding,United States,The airport is large mostly clean with long security lines. But that is all ok. The thing that is not ok is that they charge for WiFi access. They have large signs that proclaim the easy use of WiFi but in fact they charge $10 per day to access. This lack of basic Internet services is enough to prompt me to take my business away from Chicago.,1,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Frederic Elter,France,Terminal 2 - check-in and security lines ok but a long and dull wait for your flight if you are not a gold card fidelity member. Restaurants are limited and far too crowded along with the waiting areas.,2,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Bob Motto,United Kingdom,International T5 arrivals needs more attention arrived from LHR at immigration there were long lines. It is a very hot area so frustrations do start appear with tired passengers. Authorities know what flights are arriving there should be enough people on duty to meet the demand as it is not a great first impression. Transferring between terminals needs to be improved having to leave airside to go to your connecting terminal and then go back through TSA security. I had to line up for over 1hr to go through security so with the hour long wait for immigration & the hour wait to line up and go through security you need at least 3hrs if you are transferring to a domestic flight. O'Hare does need to have an Air Side transfer to reduce lines for security in the terminals otherwise passengers will start to go to other gateway airports.,1,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Barry Byrne,Ireland,Chicago T5 for international flights is a poor facility for such a major city. Firstly the long narrow design often means long walks to check in back to security in the centre and back to the gate. Routing to the CTA train is not very well signed yes it gets you to the shuttle tram fairly well but after that getting off the tram at T1 or T2 signs are geared only to passengers flying from that terminal not passengers en route to the CTA city train on the Blue line. Surely not impossible to deal with this likely eventuality. Indeed T5 passengers are probably more likely to use CTA than the domestic arrivals. Security queues outbound at T5 can be really awful it took 1hr last Tuesday for no obvious reason. Some queues moved faster than others the one on the left next to the food court (a very small basic facility) was slowest as it was always used to pass flight crew to the top of the line. Airside there are only tiny shopping facilities no newspapers except from those machines you see on the street a small selection of mass market magazines. Of course if you want food go somewhere else or bring it with you. An extraordinary lack of initiative to ignore selling to passengers with long wait times. There are very few seats at the gates even though more seats could be accommodated. Even less seats if you have to wait groundside. Air conditioning is weak particularly at check in where the sun heats the facility. It is bright and clean however and some of the art work is worth a look.,3,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Jacob Roswell,United States,Warning to O'Hare visitors. There is a group of scam artists that might approach you with a very sad story about being stuck there and needing money to get home for a funeral - sick mother - doctors appointment. This has happened to me three times in the last year. Don't give them any money! If the airport would be as diligent about these people as they are about harmless homeless people O'Hare might be more tolerable!,2,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Matt Smith,United Kingdom,Arrivals absolutely terrible experience - waiting 2hrs 15 minutes in a hot and stuffy passport control queue. They only had 4 people manning the desks while the non US-Citizen queue was 500 people. Departures - dreadful sign posting when trying to move between the CTA and different terminals. Shopping facilities quite poor in the departure lounge.,1,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Tanya Bailey,United Kingdom,For an international airport this has got to be one of the worst for lack of facilities for outgoing passengers. Immigration is great with very friendly & courteous staff who despite the long wait & heat manage to raise a smile with even the most weary passenger. The International terminal needs to update it's catering facilities both landside & airside with only a very small food court landside and a sandwich shop airside selling a few duty free items. Surely someone would have seen $ signs & created more retail outlets on both sides for such a captive market? Perhaps they should take a look at LAX or LHR & see how much money there is to be made in providing customers with better services?,3,0
chicago-ohare-airport,John Clift,United Kingdom,Overall it is not too bad previous comments about inter terminal transfer are not quite right as the monorail runs to all terminals. Access to down town via the subway is good and quick. The biggest issue is in T5 and that is the almost absence of any decent retail outlets (food and drinks etc) either side of the gates. Like all US airports security and internal long haul to short haul domestic flights is an absolute pain that needs a goof two hours for the uneducated.,3,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Nick Parry-Evans,United States,Quite the worst international airport I have ever been through. There is no direct link between the domestic terminals and the international terminal which means if you come in on an International flight you have no hope connecting unless you have at least a 3 hour wait between flights. This airport is totally unable to cope with the numbers of passengers going through it and the sooner it creates a link between the terminals where connecting passengers can go through their own security check it will get worse. I avoid this airport like the plague and pay extra to avoid it.,2,0

chicago-ohare-airport,David Stein,United States,Transited through Chicago en route to Delhia from Philadelphia. I had 8 hours between flights enroute to Delhi so popped into town by train for a walk. It was easy cheap and convenient to take the train downtown. On my way home had a 2 hour transit between flights from Delhi and onward to Philly. No problem. Passport contol customs and rechecking my bag went smoothly. Transit between T5 and T3 was easy on the Airport Transit System. Security was a bit slow but nothing unexpected. I was through everything an at my gate with an hour spare.,5,0
chicago-ohare-airport,S DePenning,United States,"For being one of the largest and busiest airports in the United States and the world I think it would be nice for this airport to be more modern and aesthetically appealing.

Other airports such as Houston's Bush Intercontinental Dallas-Fort Worth International Detroit and even Minneapolis-St. Paul have a more upscale look to them.",3,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Christina Hausser,Austria,We arrived in International Terminal 5 very late due to bad weather and had missed the last flight to Denver. We were rebooked on the first flight out the next day but since it was a different airline did not receive a voucher for a hotel. We decided to rough it out for 6 hrs in T5 upon advice from a Chicago City policeman as they had a snack stand that was open 24hrs. There were quite a few of us sharing this predicament (12 total). Around 2am a group of Aviation Police waltzed thru waking everyone up demanding to know why we were there. They proceeded to 'evict' a small group of what appeared to be homeless men in a most rude manner. These men were not bothering anyone were not under the influence of anything and were quietly sleeping (I had spoken to one of the gentlemen earlier and he was most friendly). My 9 yr old daughter started to cry at the way these poor people were treated and asked me why those policemen were being so mean.,1,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Keith Rogers,Canada,What a pit this place is. Came into Terminal 5 - zero signs for international transit and first area you show up has 1000+ people in line. Crazy. Figured out by myself there must be a different place for transit but still lines by no means short. Once through the customs little info to help on where to go to get your next flight. Finally figured T1 so train it was. Then at T1 crazy long security lineup - why did they have me leave the security zone I was in when I landed in T5 to then go back into the security zone in T1 - job making I guess as it sure is inefficient and wasted 2 hours of my time. Had 3 hours to connect and just barely made it. T1 is old and tired. Basic African airports aren't this bad and for many arriving to US for first time their initial impression is sad indeed.,1,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Rich James,United Kingdom,Arriving international as a non US citizen is a lottery at ORD. You can be very lucky and get straight through in no time at all if your plane is the only international arrival. I have taken the evening AA flight from LHR many times and found immigration bags and customs superb. However at other times it is a nightmare. Certain times of day you have 4-5 widebodies full of Germans and Koreans and I have waited in a hot immigration line for 2 hours+. Not quite as bad as Miami or Delta at JFK but worth avoiding. Unfortunately you do not know until you get there. They open a second hall when busy and that helps but it is still horrible at wrong time and wonderful at right time. Walk from plane is not too long. The shuttle between terminals is efficient and quick (wish LHR had one) and the Hilton Hotel in the airport is very convenient for overnight connections (otherwise you need 3.5 hours minimum to guarantee international connection (which is a pain when you get through in 20 minutes).,4,0
chicago-ohare-airport,W Burke,United States,Passed through Chicago on United flying from Rochester to Jackson Hole and back. Outward bound I was arriving and departing through Terminal 1 C Concourse. Good selection of eateries and bars. Free Wi Fi and pay for internet access if you didn't bring your laptop. Plenty of room even though this was late morning on a Friday. Returning I arrived at and departed from Terminal 1 B Concourse. I only has a short time to look around as I was making my connection. B Concourse seems much more crowded and cramped than C. Security was very very busy. I was lucky I didn't have to pass security. I can see how if one is arriving here from overseas and has to change terminals this Airport could be an absolute nightmare.,4,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Kevin Tunnicliffe,United Kingdom,The queue for immigration was mercifully quite short and there were a number of officers on duty. Just as well because the temperature was very high and although we only had to quue for about twenty minutes it felt like bread waiting to be baked in a furnace. The luggage was on the belt as we came out of immigration. We were sharing a belt with passengers from another flight and different airline so quite a bit of confusion. The car rental sites are away from the airport so we had to wait for a courtesy bus to take us over to them. Consequently it was about an hour and a half after landing before we were on the road.,2,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Barry Byrne,Ireland,T5 has very limited facilities long narrow design means possible long walks from check in to gate. Few places to sit while waiting for check in to open if travelling internationally and the food court is very undersized and poorly located just before the TSA security check so you may have to fight your way through the long confused security queue to get in to the food court. While I was there the queue for security never diminished it ran almost to the front door with three slow moving lines. It was amusing to hear demands to have passports out - might even expire while in your hand waiting to clear security. When you get through well there are toilets but not much else the type of amenities you might find at the very end of a pier at other airports. Eat before you come in here. Signs to the city rail link the MTA are poor also from T5 yes you do go through the multi story car park en route. T3 was much better once again long walks possible here allow plenty time for any transit connection and do not rely on minimum connection times.,3,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Jerry Szopinski,,O'Hare has been around a long time but upgrades have kept it at the top. On my outbound flight check-in was quick and easy the lines at the security scanners were short the gate areas were large and clean with comfortable seats. The only negative is that there aren't a lot of shops or places to eat once your through the security scanners. For some reason ORD delayed our take off for 30 minutes. Coming back my flight was on time customs was a breeze but it took a long time to get my baggage.,4,0
chicago-ohare-airport,L Mellor,,Top Marks for Large European Family with 4 Kids. Airport was clean with hand sanitizers scattered everywhere toilets exceptionally clean. United have fantastic baggage service for passengers who have to clear customs and need to put checked luggage onto final destination. 5m from customs clearance United just grab your bag scan it and put it onto the belt. Hands down best system I've seen in a long time. Children's museum in terminal 2 is must. Its more like a play area and my four children spent 2 hours there without any sense of boredom. Could have been there much longer without worry. Traveller's Aid Centre supplied free diapers when nearby vending machine had ran out. MacDonalds in Terminal 1 had no seating area. Had to use seats at nearby gate and felt guilty about the mess my family left (ii) Immigration queues in T5 resulted in 45 minute wait. T5 duty free very poor selection compared to T1.,5,0
chicago-ohare-airport,T Vetter,,Arrived late from Zurich on LX resulting in a 1:45 connection which proved to be very tight. Immigration line moved quickly but baggage took nearly twenty minutes to appear on the carousel; customs typical perfunctory effort; tram to Terminal B too infrequent for the number of passengers. The big issue was the glacial TSA screening line at Terminal B - only two scanners for well over 200 people in line. We made our domestic connection with 10 minutes to spare but like previous reviewers our bags did not arrive home until the next afternoon due to inadequate TSA checked baggage screening capacity. United representative in Birmingham told me it happens all the time that bags do not clear screening in time to make the flight. I can see why Chicago did not get the 2016 Summer Olympics : O'Hare is simply overwhelmed with volume.,3,0
chicago-ohare-airport,E Ferwerda,,Used this airport about two weeks ago transferring from Terminal 1 to Terminal 5. Overall a very pleasant experience the airport seemed very clean and bright. The transfer between terminals was quick and easy even in mid-day. Following advice from previous postings here I ate in Terminal 5 outside security. To my surprise the Security lines at Terminal 5 were non- existent! I wish there was a way to transfer between terminals without having to go back through security but due to the short lines as mentioned this is only a minor issue. Clear layout and signage excellent facility overall. Would recommend and will use again.,4,0
chicago-ohare-airport,R Tay,,Toilets were clean. Quite easy to find your boarding gate. Waiting time for immigration clearance should be improved a little. The confusing part lies in tht the international terminal which you arrive in may not be the same terminal as where your check-in counter for your return flight is. Overall a pleasant place to be in.,4,0
chicago-ohare-airport,D Murphy,,I have used Chicago O'Hare numerous times for International and Domestic flights. I wanted to give this airport 4 or even 5 stars for the experience I have had of Terminals 1-3 however T5 drags it right back down. Departures: There are almost no facilities beyond security bar a few carts selling candy and cigarettes. There is no bar except for a temporary stand selling bottled beer - not exactly the way to unwind before a long flight. Before security things are a little better - you can at least get something to eat albeit at McDonalds. Arrivals: There's a long wait for bags however my destination has always been from Ireland where immigration is done before take-off so this mitigates that somewhat as we don't have to queue. There is a bar in arrivals (one might have considered putting the bar in departures?) and a shop but little else and the area is cramped with few seats. The rest of O'Hare is a pleasure but it's as if International flights are an afterthought. I understand that Chicago is a domestic hub but as an international traveller it's actually a bit of an insult.,2,0
chicago-ohare-airport,T Neyrinck,,Used T5 at O'Hare twice last week coming from and leaving to LHR. The terminal is perfect to perform a terminal's main goal - getting people quickly and efficiently off and on an airplane onto or off a cab/bus/. It took less than 10 minutes to leave the plane pick up my luggage pass immigration (being a non-US citizen) and into a cab. When leaving check-in desks are plenty and gates are only (on average) a 2 minutes walk from security gates (which are next to the check-in desks). Be aware that T5 has no eateries and only very basic duty free. Almost nothing in fact. But as said before T5 is meant to be an arrivals/departure building which works very well and not a shopping mall.,4,0
chicago-ohare-airport,J Olivier,,Arrived from Paris at O'Hare and everything went downhill from there. We had allowed 2 hours to connect to our flight to Calgary Canada. The plane was 30 minutes late from Paris and the immigration line is terrible. It takes forever to go through. Canadians do not require fingerprinting and photos yet we have to stand in the same line. The US residents cleared quickly but it took us 50 minutes. After that we grabbed our bags which were sitting on a non-revolving luggage carousel since we took so long and attempted to drop off our bags. All there was was United personnel yelling at people to move around to different spots and there was no queue. It shouldn't take 10 minutes to drop the bags off. Took the airport train to terminal 1. Not well thought out everything revolves around 1 escalator so people bunch up. Went through the United Priority security. Not sure why it was priority it took 20 minutes for TSA to scan 10 people. I'm sorry but it shouldn't take that long. We then had to do the run between terminal B and C. When we arrived at the gates the jetway was pulling away from the plane fortunately they put it back so we could get on. 2 hours should be sufficient. When we got to Calgary our bags and the bags of about 15 other passengers were missing. Apparently ours got hung up in TSA which doesn't have screening for transferred bags at the international terminal so they went off sight and then come back. Unfortunately ours never returned. Now we have to hope they are on the next plane and clear Canadian customs ok.,2,0
chicago-ohare-airport,T William,,I would say that the experience varies greatly depending on the terminal you face but at least in general security wait times have dramatically improved over the past few years. United and American each have their own terminals more or less that can look somewhat grim but have a fair amount of services available. The United terminal has a tunnel that you must walk through to get to most gates (C Concourse) but at least they more or less synched together the audio warnings about reaching the end of the moving walkway. Walk to gates for American can reach 10-15 minutes if your luck is bad. Terminal 3 feels Soviet in design aesthetic but at least is being updated. Access to/from city center can be truly problematic - most hours of the day the drive (20 minutes no traffic) is at least an hour and without a car you are consigned to either an extremely overpriced (US$50) cab or an uncomfortable train ride. Delays are probably the worst aspect - part of a political game to make the traveller suffer so that Daley can get the airport expansion approved.,3,0
chicago-ohare-airport,M Graham,,No problems arriving at Chcago o Hare. The immigration officer was very friendly. Queues were minimal and we got our luggage quickly. Leaving was equally problem free. Luckily we ate land side as there was almost nothing airside. Just a few stalls selling sandwiches. Is this normal or part of work being done?,4,0
chicago-ohare-airport,A Johnson,,Despite being one of the world's busiest airports and a hub for two major airlines O'Hare seems ill-equipped to process an influx of passengers at peak times. During the mid-afternoon international arrivals window the customs area was mobbed. Lines for US citizens moved swiftly but the processing of foreigners was glacial thanks to the multiple fingerprint scans and photographs that need to be taken. Baggage belts were also swamped with people to the point where it was difficult to elbow in and grab your own bag. Recheck was a mob scene with people becoming so frustrated at the slow service that they left their bags in a pile for the airline staff to figure out. In order to transfer to a domestic flight you need to take the airport transit system which ran so infrequently that it became dangerously overcrowded. At the terminal all passengers must squeeze onto a narrow escalator which effectively required everybody (and their rollaboard) to form a single-file line. Domestic departures proceeded more smoothly with only a minimal wait at security and an adequate number of shops and restaurants airside. One complaint about the departure areas is that many of them are too small to effectively contain the number of people when two flights board from side-by-side gates simultaneously.,2,0
chicago-ohare-airport,A Turek,,It may look like a vision of hell but it got the job done.

chicago-ohare-airport,S Wil by,,We expected a surly welcome to America and were not disappointed. The immigration officer seemed to want to provoke an argument with his questions about why we were visiting Chicago and how we could afford to pay for our visit and with his negative comments about the city - I hope he does not apply for a post with the Tourist Board. The signage was poor for train transport to the city. The departure lounges in terminal 5 are disappointing with poor catering facilities once through security but at least the flight was on time and the baggage recovery on arrival was excellent.,3,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Dave Hay,,It's the worst ever airport I have been to. The passport control took over 1 hour to go through having only 3 people to check International passports for thousands that were passing thru' - welcome to America!

chicago-ohare-airport,S Srinivasan,,I've never had too many problems connecting through ORD. There are dedicated security lines for First/Business/elite FFs and those lines are never very long. At least in T3 there are a fair number of shops and restaurants to choose from and the AA Admirals Club is conveniently located between Concourses H and K so you have an easy walk to your gate. I've also never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes at immigration though granted the flight I use from DEL comes in very early in the morning when there aren't any other flights around. The main complaint I have about ORD is the utter lack of information concerning delays at least for AA flights. Flights are often shown as on-time right up to the scheduled boarding time at which point a delay magically appears with no explanation given by the ground staff. I guess they don't see the need anymore given the chronic delays that plague ORD these days. Overall though there are far worse places to transit through.,3,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Frank Sherwin,,I had the misfortune to connect at O'Hare airport en route from San Jose to Copenhagen. It was my first time in Chicago and my considered impression is that O'Hare is a breathtakingly unfriendly place. From virtually the moment of disembarking where arriving and transiting passengers were prevented from leaving having to side-step high-fiving security types and obnoxious passport controls (please and thank you obviously never made it this far into the mid-West) navigating the terminals (gate M11 is in terminal 5 that's perfectly clear then) until the dingy airside international departure lounge with it's roped-shut kiosks and virtually complete lack of facilities... it was an abysmal experience.,1,0
chicago-ohare-airport,D Pavlovic,,Recently flew twice to Chicago FRA-ORD-MSN and MUC-ORD-MSN had absolutely no problems with immigration although there were other flights arrived at the same time to T5. I would say it just depends on a situation. Had no problems with re-checking my luggage for my connection flight or changing between T5 and T1. There was a queue at the T1 security check but it moved relatively fast. I consider one of the biggest ORD problems delays and changing of gates - my flight to MSN was delayed then the delay was shortened than again increased then again shortened and so on - gates were being changed three times people were going crazy. Going back to FRA and MUC respectively was nice and smooth. In general I find it very good and have no complains.,4,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Mark Simons,,If you have time in connecting  avoid the cramped conditions and queues to eat in the domestic terminals and head for the Hilton - which can be reached by foot.

It really is worth the detour if you have a couple of hours,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Martyn Rogers,,Arrived from LHR into terminal 5 and after walking into the immigration area discovered it was virtually empty. Maybe we were just lucky or there are no other international flights arriving around this time (1315) but we were through immigration within 10 mins. Staff took fingerprints photograph and were on our way no grilling - just smiles! Flying back from O'Hare check in was smooth and efficient. As flying business class were able to use the fast track immigration queue took around 10-15 mins to pass through once airside was impressed how modern and clean the airport was. Plenty of choice for places to eat/drink duty free was rather basic but adequate. Overall a very pleassnt experience and a much better one than a visit to Orlando Intl 3 years ago.,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Jason Lawley,,Arriving into the US after a long transatlantic flight to be greeted by the longest looking Immigration queue of all time is not the best start to a visit to the US (four flights arriving at the same time from Asia and Europe). Non-US citizens queue took 1h 30 mins to get through and in this time the security staff walk around like prison guards checking that not a single person dare use their cellphone until after immigration. Immigration officers treat you as if you are a possible suspect with questioning and attitude not found at any other airport or country worldwide. Check-in areas are however relatively pleasant - numerous self check-in machines (for United Airlines anyway) in the US- domestic area and security not a problem if you have a Star Alliance Gold/Silver card for instance as there is an express lane for such holders which was a nice surprise. Flight expected departure time updates for both domestic and international flights was found to be largely erratic - if the flight is on-time then the gate/time info is fine but if your flight is delayed low betide if you can get any accurate info on where you should go and how long you will be waiting for. For several ORD-LHR flights that I have taken over the past few months majority have been delayed and the new departure time has almost never been provided nor has gate info. Meant that pax were wandering around not having a clue whether the flight is cancelled/delayed etc and airport customer services queues were perhaps 30 mins long if you wanted to go find out.,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Prakash Kotagal,,Now that water bottles are not allowed to be carried through security guess what has happened to the price of a bottle of water? I had to pay $2.75 for a small bottle because the water fountain adjacent to gate E8 was broken (and has been broken for quite a while). I would like to know what O'Hare airport authorities are doing about this. I am all for a market economy etc. but this is too much to pay for water! A little bit of oversight by the airport authorities would be welcome and much appreciated by travelers.,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Steve Maier,,MUC-ORD-CVG. I had a satisfactory experience in ORD. From landing of the aircraft (Lufthansa) to arrival at the nice Red Carpet Lounge of United (comfy new and well equipped) in terminal 2 took me only 50 minutes. The Terminal where we arrived was relatively new yes the way from the plane to immigrations was awfully long but still shorter than in Shanghai. Immigration was efficient even if it was rush hour it took me only 15 minutes to go through. Took train to terminal 2 and after a couple of minutes I was airside. I have no complaints will consider flying through Chicago again.,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Javier Urra,,"MAD-ORD with Iberia. If possible avoid Chicago airport. immigration lines for non American are simply endless and when you finally exit you will find no indication about baggage claim belt. On the contrary it is likely to find airport staff gathering suitcases in some corner or even worse taking suitcases to ""somewhere"". My baggage was completely unattended pretty far from the belt and I did not find my second baggage until 6 days later completely destroyed. Dirty old style and feeling guilty just for asking ""Where is the Madrid baggage?"" is the welcome words you will find if arriving to ORD Chicago O Hare",,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Ed Fry,,"Chicago Airport may not be the most favoured hub to pass through although it's somewhat unavoidable since both United & American (both Heathrow customers...) hub there. T5 is interesting. Disembarking tired jetlagged passengers into a grey walled low-ceiling walkway is not the ideal way to say ""hey welcome to the united states"". Immigration has queues no matter what although our queuing only lasted 10 minutes. Cheerful customs greeted us with a smile which was nice after baggage claim and we dropped our bags at the United baggage transfer facility at T5. The train is harmless although initially from T5 can b a little full. T1 security is somewhat threatening. A women who sticks her hand vaguely in your direction and yelps passports (on a domestic flight) is hardly inviting and then she scribbles the gate number on our boarding cards ... it's sort of pointless... I transferred through Chicago 3 times in less than 3 weeks. The bus to E & F (United Express) gates from C (United) gates is small and not wheelchair accessable. It's a minbus with benches all facing inwards. The main C Councourse is rather attractive; it allows plenty of natural light in and allows good views of the tarmac.",,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Neil Ramsay,,Arrived mid afternoon at T5 with other aircraft. The foreigner lines at immigration were extremely long but authorities did their best to open resident gates when not in use and move overflow to other sections to reduce the delay. Took an hour to get through which considering the crowd was not too bad. INS agent polite and welcoming. Baggage already available and customs inspection minimal. United's baggage transfer can be a bit confusing for the uninitiated but mine has always turned up at my final destination so there must be a system operating. Train to Terminal 2 was quick and painless. Security here quick and efficient. Bad weather earlier in the day had caused considerable flight back up and eventual cancellations. Terminals were extremely crowded with many angry and frustrated passengers. Our United agent handled our rebooking with good grace. Next morning's checkin was a long and a little frustrating with late arriving passengers with imminent departures getting preference over those who did the right thing and turned up for their flights early. Departure gates in T2 were very crowded and obviously flights had been overbooked with constant requests for passengers with time on their hands to give up their seats for the normal compensations. Not the best airport experience but certainly not the worst.,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Richard Allan,,"The airport facilities have not been re-arranged to take into account ""security"" requirements although 9-11 is several years behind us. Example: Post-office access (Terminal 2 only) is behind the security gates. Airports everywhere need to move general-use sites out of the departing-passenger-only zones; perhaps O'Hare will bear this in mind when a re-build is contemplated (and shabby as Terminals 3 and 5 are one is needed soon).",,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Robert Clark,,When changing airlines through ORD the place can be a nightmare. My flight was Alaska Airlines ANC-ORD and United Xpress ORD-CAE. United and Alaska terminals are very far apart at ORD so you have to cross the street use the train to the very last terminal pick up your ticket go through security and walk down about 20 minutes to finally get to the xpress gates which is normally at the end of the United terminal. No moving sidewalk to help out. Should you find yourself changing airlines at ORD get your ticket from ORD to destination at the airport of origin. (In my case get my Alaska Airlines ticket then go to United/Canada and get the ORD-CAE ticket.) Otherwise you could be waiting in line at the ticket counter for a very long time. You will be in the same situation if you are flying to smaller airports in the northeast or southeast USA.,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Jean Coldham,,"I fly Internationally out of Terminal 5 at least 5 times a year and am always amazed at how bad the facilities are at International Departures. Hardly anywhere to sit - just fast food ""restaurants"" no shops to speak of. This is a golden opportunity missed! International travelers have to spend at least 2 hours in this terminal with nothing decent to eat and no stores to roam around - not even enough room to sit and wait comfortably. Once through security there is nothing at all!! The other terminals where you only have to wait 1 hour have plenty of amenities. Also bear in mind that lots of Indians and Pakistani families live in the Chicago area and when they leave the country the whole family is there to see them off so terribly overcrowded!",,0
chicago-ohare-airport,James O'Brien,,I had my first travelling experience through O'Hare over the busy Christmas period. I have used Midway before and avoid O'Hare because of things people told me about it. I found O'Hare pleasant place - I landed at terminal 5 on American Airlines didn't have to do immigration as it was done in Dublin. After collecting my bags clearing customs and rechecking was out in 20 mins and in terminal 3 for my flight to Toronto 5 mins later. Nice selection of shops bars and places to eat. Fast train service between terminals.,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Aaron Garrett,,I've flown in and out of Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports on numerous occasions and O'Hare is so much easier. On a recent KLM flight to Amsterdam I was impressed on how quickly we passed through security. Especially considering there were quite a few other airlines checking in for flights. I was disappointed however at the lack of services offered once through security. And my experiences with O'Hare customs have been pleasant no long waits. Each terminal has its own security checkpoint unlike MDW or ATL which are just a mass of people at one security checkpoint and involve long waits.,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Yevheniy Kahanovych,,"Great architecture pleasant structure to look at. The whole place is telling ""come here again"" but as to the functionality of the venue I have to say some unpleasant words. First cleanliness of toilets is a must not facultative. Second the fact that trolleys are not allowed at the transit train between terminals makes transiting painful for passengers with bags (especially for families). Third terminals 2 and 3 are not lit enough. In the evening arrivals areas on the ground level look gloomy. Terminal 1 is not well signposted. If you fly with United and your departure terminal is #2 you have to check-in at Terminal 1 and then go to Terminal 2 through a special passage for United domestic passengers. Stupid and terribly confusing for those who fly first time. I've spent some 20 minutes in Terminal 2 trying to find United check-in desks among ones of Northwest and Continental and then somehow guessed it should be at the Terminal 1. Food I ate at the outlet near the gate (Terminal 2 airside ) was iedible. Departing from Terminal 5 on British Airways was a difficult experience. Slow check-in and nothing to eat after security at 9pm but the terminal itself is nice roomy and convenient. Arriving with united to the state-of-the-art concourse B of Terminal 1 was a great pleasure. All in all great look poor touch.",,0
chicago-ohare-airport,A Hilbun,,There is no way around the fact that O'Hare is simply a zoo. The facilities are simply not well equipped to handle the number of people that pass through it. Terminal 1 security is a nightmare even though there are two checkpoints one at each end of the building. Terminals 1 and 5 are also starting to look worn despite the fact that they are relatively new. That said the airport is well-maintained and relatively clean especially in light of the number of people who use the facility on a daily basis. United now needs to take a cue from Northwest Airlines (who built a new terminal facility for them and their partners at Detroit Metro) and build a new terminal at O'Hare that would allow United customers to transit from international to domestic flights in the same building.,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Mark Taylor,,I'd suggest avoiding O'Hare if you are trying to connect from an international flight to a domestic one. No fast track for F/J class passengers no help whatsoever with flight connections. You just wait in the queue at immigration and take your chances. It's not even logical they had space at the US immigration channel so some uniform opened the barrier for people waiting behind me to go through. One guy tried to join this from near me- probably also had a connection- but aforementioned jobsworth shooed him back. I can handle the idea of needing extra security but if you US immigration can't find a way within this to accommodate the realities of an international hub then come clean and tell people not to try connecting at this or other US airports operating on this basis- which is many of them I believe. To their credit the airport and airline staff are pretty good at managing the situation and getting you on a later flight because they are well used to this farce and ashamed of it too. I know LHR immigration is bad but at least there's an effort to get people to their connection. If this is truly where US government/immigration has arrived at post 9/11 I'm afraid you've conceded a clear victory to the terrorists on this one.,,0
chicago-ohare-airport,Stefan Paetow,,Chicago O'Hare is a mixed opinion here. International Arrivals are fantastic the most friendly INS and Customs staff I have ever encountered flying to the US. Efficient straight-forward and just plain good. International Departures is slightly less nice. Limited seating areas before check-in NO left luggage facilities even pre-9/11. Airline check-in is airy and open and makes life in the queue bearable. Almost no shops/amenities after going through security control which is a real shame. Domestic terminals are a nightmare. United's Terminal has NO information boards to tell you which terminal and which gate your flight is due to depart at staff are rude and unhelpful when you are stranded and where on earth are the information desks? On the far end of the half-mile terminal? The Skytrain makes moving from International terminal to domestic terminal easy though.,,0
chisinau-airport,J Petersson,Sweden,A pleasant experience. The prices are much better be it food or duty-free and the atmosphere is much more relaxed with friendly check-in staff and passport control agents. No shouting in Russian and no high-handed treatment of foreigners. Departures lounge can get crowded at peak times though and the catering options are nothing to write home about.,8,0
chittagong-shah-amanat-airport,F Coleman,United States,Nice international terminal but domestic isn't very spacious. There is a snack bar and a duty free shop in the international terminal and nothing in domestic. On way in the customs is fast longest wait I've had is 30 min. Satisfactory airport but would not want a long layover here.,3,0
chittagong-shah-amanat-airport,Kevin Muckenthaller,United States,Airport is a 20 km (9 miles) scenic river-side drive south of Chittagong City Center reachable by taxi or car. No local hotels or serious restaurants available within the vicinity. There are snacks and confections available in a couple of spots on the grounds side within the terminal. Renovated recently the interior is unusually modern and comfortable for a regional airport in a small country like this. The new aero-bridges serve the airport well and efficient and courteous staff make it easy to find one's way through the facility. Toilets are fair to middling but that's expected. Overall not bad at all!,5,0
chongqing-jiangbei-airport,G A Bray,Australia,Flew domestically into Chongqing on Sichuan Airlines and for some reason our aerobridge was at the small International Terminal 1. Requiring us to walk 100m around the edge of the terminal concourse and walk down stairs to a shuttle bus to carry Terminal 2 which being winter was bitterly cold especially with the doors opened while the bus waited for a full load. Once inside the proper domestic terminal it was pretty straight forward and standard routine. Once excellent feature was a lady handing out bi-lingual cards listing taxi fare prices to over a dozen destinations around the city to discourage touting and rip offs. For the return I found out the single domestic Terminal 2 is actually split into 3 separate halls A B and C. If you flight is leaving through hall C you can not enter via A or B security points. This also means you are technically shut off from the shops and facilities in the other sections too such as the McDonalds in hall A. However you are able to walk downstairs to the Arrivals level and use the transfer signage to direct you to the other areas making the segregation of the terminal areas pointless. Lastly with the security it was the only place I was asked to take my boots off beyond the X-Ray machine which all passengers were made to do. However with only one seat it meant a longer wait as you could not progress until the person in front had taken off their boots was examined and then re-laced them.,6,1
chongqing-jiangbei-airport,Graeme Bray,Australia,Landed at the newer of the two terminals. Baggage collection was fast and was able to buy a phone card easily on the lower Arrivals level but telephones were only on the upper Departures level. Security was tight with baggage tags checked by airport staff. No illegal taxi touts hounding you and bus into the city was quick and easy. On departing the airline waiting areas were large and comfortable. The food in some places was cheap very cheap. Same as supermarket price for bottle of Pepsi. Had a gate change but was handled quickly and easily. Efforts were made to keep me informed despite being the only foreigner on my flight. New monorail will soon open from airport to city. Airport taxi prices are not too expensive but be prepared for a wild and crazy ride.,5,0
christchurch-airport,David Killick,New Zealand,Recent upgrades have made this airport far more international in flavor but it still has a friendly Kiwi feel. The NZ landscape scenes and birdsong in the jetways make a lovely welcome and farewell! Good view of Southern Alps from min international departure lounge. The new domestic lounge is also a nice piece of architecture. Although it handles international flights Christchurch is still a fairly compact airport and you should not anticipate long waits. Border checks on arrival may take a little longer but border staff are protecting the country from nasty bugs that could devastate NZ primary industries. Only downsides: big multi-storey car-park dominates the exterior on the city side; lack of fast and easy express bus to city center and taxis are expensive.,9,1
christchurch-airport,B Andy,United Kingdom,Small but fantastic airport very modern and clean. Terminal is easy to get around Internet is quick and many shops and dining areas present at the airport. All in all a great new airport and one of the finest in Australasia.,9,1
christchurch-airport,A McNicol,Australia,Arrived on a 100% full Emirates 777 (economy class) and was out of the terminal in 20 minutes. The new international departure area is the best part of the terminal with a lot of space and great views across to the snow capped mountains. The regional part of the terminal is a zoo with totally inadequate space and seating.,8,1
christchurch-airport,Steven Cao,China,Jan 5 Queenstown-Christchurch Jan 8 Christchurch-Singapore. Small but lovely airport easily access to downtown with airport shuttle bus. Very efficient check-in security check immigration and baggage claim service polite and friendly airport staff food and beverages price reasonable.,7,1
christchurch-airport,I Higginson,United Kingdom,"This airport has a very bad attitude to travellers who need to wait overnight. My wife and I had an early flight and could not check-in online so had to arrive at a time when it would have been pointless to book a hotel room. We were not the only ones in this situation but all of us were herded to the most draughty place in the terminal and forced to sit on uncomfortable metal seats all night even though there were more comfortable seats nearby. We could have paid to use a ""lounge"" area but on investigation this was found to be a dark dingy airless space barely more comfortable than in the terminal. A security check was carried out on all those waiting and we were issued with wristbands so restricting our comfort in this way is completely unreasonable. Some passengers tried to get some sleep laying on the floor but were woken up and forced to move by the security staff. The excuse for this? We would be safer if there was another earthquake! What spurious rubbish. Shame on you Christchurch Airport.",3,0
christchurch-airport,V Combe,Australia,I travel to Christchurch probably 3 times a year. I find the airport great with a very New Zealand feel to it. Comfortable seats lovely shops in the departure lounge to pick up some memorabilia. For the size of the city it is perfect - a very relaxed feel.,10,1
christchurch-airport,R Bordogna,Italy,I really love CHC airport after its thorough renewal basically a new airport (especially in the domestic section which was somewhat dingy before renewal). Modern clean spacious and efficient in my opinion currently the best airport in NZ (though obviously smaller than AKL).,9,1
christchurch-airport,Gavin Munro,Cambodia,It is hard to believe that this airport is a new design - a new design should be better than what has gone before not worse. The worst aspect of it for me was the 50 metres my elderly mother had to walk in the icy wind from the only drop-off point to reach the terminal (200 metres to International Arrivals). There is neither roof nor windbreak. Wheel chairs are available only once you reach the terminal. Have a look at Auckland: out of the car/taxi/bus - into the terminal; Singapore Wellington and thousands of others including the old Christchurch airport the same. What genius designed this in Christchurch? The regional terminal is a zoo with grossly inadequate facilities - especially seating - to service the volume of passengers. The old airport used to be pretty good - perhaps a bit of a mess in terms of design but it had a lot of character and history behind it. The new(ish) International Lounge area is also good with lots of glass and natural light and good passenger facilities. The recently completed airport is a windowless concrete block totally focused on commercialism.,2,0
christchurch-airport,D Cortesi,Australia,Arrived at airport on flight NZ 888 at about 11.25pm. I travel frequently and have used the airport before. I usually sit in the arrivals area watching TV after buying a coffee and sandwich at the cafeteria (the only venue open). I was travelling to Dunedin and was waiting for the bus that left at 6am. Last night I was ordered to leave the lounge having no where to go since the departures lounge opens only at 3am. I asked why I was not allowed to use the lounge since I was not breaking any of the written rules displayed in the airport. The tart answer from the official was that it was their airport and they decide who sits where. You can not afford to infuriate visitors to your country by having ridiculous rules and rude staff as the first point of call to an international airport.,,0
christchurch-airport,David Dale,Australia,Airport is currently under renovation. A new section of the terminal is complete and it is a vast improvement from the old building. The check-in area is spacious modern and very New Zealand. The airport is well signed. Entry and exit by vehicle to the airport is a breeze. Air New Zealand check-in area is great and not cluttered. Looking forward to when the whole renovation is complete.,5,0
christchurch-airport,A Coole,United Kingdom,Easy to park easy to walk around and find what you're after and very stress free. New terminal just opened which makes it even better. Just needs more international flights to/from the city now.,5,0
christchurch-airport,Paul Harvey,United Kingdom,I was flying from the international terminal which had suffered some damaged in the recent earthquake. Although parts of it were closed due to damage (some food areas some waiting areas) staff were determined to put on a brave face and some asked us to e sure to return in six months when they hoped to have the damage repaired and to be operating normally. The international area is bright and welcoming there are plenty of seats and it is very spacious.,5,0
christchurch-airport,Daniel Ginders,New Zealand,Such a vast improvement in design productivity and functionality for the domestic terminal. It's open so you can feel the change of seasons. The international terminal has been fantastic since the last revamp. Customs a breeze bio-security not too shabby. And the new themed bridges are stunning to give visitors an inside first-hand glimpse before they even get out of the airport.,5,0
christchurch-airport,David Robertson,Australia,Bit unfair to review in some ways as this airport is currently being re-vamped. The domestic side is in dire need of work. Small pokey and tired it will be hopefully much improved soon. The International departures area has been done and is quite good though there are not enough seats when it is busy and it is lacking in character. What a shame this pretty city did not get an airport that reflects some of it's charm?,4,0
christchurch-airport,Steve Conroy,,A very clean and tidy airport with adequate amenities. Domestic and international are very open and easy to find your way around. However alo of the positive points are lost on two very odd aspects at the international terminal: firstly CHC Airport still requires the payment of departure tax at the bank outlet - airlines are not permitted to include it in their fares. Secondly the entry to customs and the departure lounge remains closed even though the airline check-ins are open and processing passengers. The result is a long queue of angry passengers waiting to clear customs when they eventually decide to open it. This is very unusual and highly annoying (as noted by previous reviewers). No reason is offered - it's as though it's just for the convenience of customs officials.,3,0
christchurch-airport,J Cobcroft,,Christchurch airport is a great little airport. Very efficient and friendly staff with good amenities clean and comfortable.,5,0
christchurch-airport,David Hughes,,Friendly Qantas check in told me that the business lounge was opposite gate 29. They did not say that the international lounge would be closed and we would have to wait outside for almost an hour with no explanation part of a growing and frustrated crowd. We watched a steady stream of staff enter via keypad each carefully avoiding eye contact with the waiting customers. One group of travellers arriving as staff entered followed to the door but were swiftly repulsed given short shrift. We were eventually admitted passed through the formalities and I made for the Qantas business lounge which I found to be closed for a further half an hour with no indication as to why. A passenger paying the business class fare has as part of the expectation free access to the appropriate business lounge this I believe I paid for when I booked with BA/Qantas why did they not say that the airport would in effect be closed to international passengers. Christchurch is a fine city but it seems to have a part time airport.,2,0
christchurch-airport,D Dale,,Qantas domestic is great. No line ups fast check-in and check-in staff were always friendly. Gate lounge was roomy with views out onto the airside area. Good selection of shops and eateries. There is a public viewing deck for the tarmac and planes. This was very interesting and imagine rare for international airports in this day and age. The domestic and international airports though separate are under one roof which is convenient for those landing and departing internationally and domestically at Christchurch. Just a great little airport with all the comfort of its bigger counterparts across the globe.,4,0
christchurch-airport,M Graham,,Christchurch is a nice little airport where you can sit and watch the planes while having something to eat. There is also a viewing deck which is unusual in these days of heightened security. I noticed a useful little play area which seemed to be keeping a lot of children happy. The airport was clean and the staff very polite and friendly.,4,0
christchurch-airport,S Blackburn,,Very compact airport with a bright new international wing. Prompt provision on bags on carousel after a Qantas domestic flight. It's also across the road (the walking route is signposted) from the Antarctic base and visitor centre which is well worth a visit if you have 2 or more hours to spare.,4,0
christchurch-airport,Mike Monro,,Not a frequent flyer but manage a trip to Oz most years. Domestic Air New Zealand area often crowded. Qantas domestic area less so. The domestic part of the terminal is quite old but has plenty of shops. It is unusual not being able to find as seat in the public areas. There is a good outdoor viewing area. The whole international terminal area is new and nice. As most flights to Oz and Singapore leave mid afternoon the check-in area can be crowded from 12.00 onwards. Buy your $25.00 departure fee coupon nice and early! The departure lounge area is all new and a pleasure. The whole airport is quite compact. You can walk from Int. arrival hall to the Domestic area in 2 minutes or so. Transport to the city is a breeze. Plenty of taxis and shuttles. Also $5.00 mini buses that go to the central city. Or take the metro airport bus for about $7.00. Buses run every 20-30 minutes and have GPS. So you can look at a display board and it will tell you when the next bus will arrive.,,0
christchurch-airport,Dane Spall,,I have just returned back home after visiting NZ and I must say CHC Airport was a pleasure to use. It is nice and compact and people don't have to walk miles to get from A to B! The immigration staff were very polite and cheerful and there was a great duty free shop near the boarding gates. Even though there was 5 flights departing within an hour of each other to Australia and Singapore it was non chaotic and there was heaps of seating and space. Personally I felt CHC International Airport was a lot better than Auckland International Airport.,,0
christchurch-airport,Carl Schedlich,,A small airport with very limited choice of shops and food outlets though generally pretty quiet. Queues are not a problem and there are plenty of staff on though some did seem to lack knowledge a bag of mine got stuck on the X-ray conveyor and the staff person did not know that the machine could be stopped let alone how to stop it!,,0
christchurch-airport,John Kelly,,I live in Christchurch so perhaps I am biased but I rate it as one of the best around. International arrivals is particularly pleasant especially considering New Zealand's tight bio-security systems. It's a great feeling to be back home! International economy check-in can get slow and crowded like many these days and the nearby coffee shop is too small but once in the spacious departure lounge peace and quiet rule. Domestic arrival and departure is somewhat airline dependant but luggage arrives promptly and it's no distance to transport and car parks. The drive to Christchurch must be the best start to any visit to any country.,,0
christchurch-airport,Malcolm Hiddleston,,Although it is not big by international standards Christchurch airport in New Zealand is a very nice airport. It has recently just had a major upgrade and is now a very pleasant and efficient airport with friendly staff and beautiful uncluttered facilities. Even in busy periods there never seems to be any sense of panic that one seems to get at the bigger airports. There is a very efficient and reasonably inexpensive shuttle service to the city along one of the most beautiful routes from any airport that I have ever had the pleasure of travelling on. Whilst most travellers to NZ seem to arrive in Auckland it is worth going direct to Christchurch especially if the majority of your visit is in the South Island of NZ.,,0
christmas-island-airport,Xuess Wee,,A very small airport more like an airstrip. 3 airlines fly there I think: Silkair Air Pacific & National Jets. Departure and Arrival Halls are in the same building and passengers disembark and embark the plane via the stairs and tarmac. For arrival customs clearance procedures are simple fuss-free and then you wait in line to collect your baggage(s) as they are being towed in. There is a large car park outside the Arrival Hall where you can also make arrangements to loan your transport while on the island through a couple of car agencies. There is a cafe and a small gift shop inside the Departure Hall. Checking-in is done manually. The Visitor Centre may have personnel at the airport running surveys collecting opinions and comments with regard to your stay.,,0
cincinnati-airport,Joel Camins,United States,"I flew Frontier to Denver this time. The security screening area is new since last, but completely inadequate. Grumpy and pushy TSA agents, and lacking organization. The airport feels if they forgot to turn on the AC on this hot, muggy day in June. What a miserable experience. ",2,0
cincinnati-airport,K Boggs,United States,Airport security employees are the rudest and most grouchy bunch I have encountered. Dining options are very few and far between. But overall wait times are not bad.,5,0
cincinnati-airport,Kathleen Remner,United States,Terrible walk ways have been broken for more than 8 months. I have flown in or out of this airport 50 times since Sept 2013. United baggage is the worst here leaving baggage unattended and office unmanned with serious delays. Carpeted floors make it difficult to push pull or drag bags. Train has extremely long waits and bathrooms do not have hooks in stalls to keep purses off the floor. With a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being best I would rate this airport a 2.,2,0
cincinnati-airport,Jim Porter,United States,I flew on Delta Airlines to MCO and it was a great airport. The terminal was clean and beautiful it really tells about the city's history. The employees were very helpful. The lines for TSA were short and fast. This airport is slightly expensive but it is worth it. I would recommend.,10,1
cincinnati-airport,J Quinterno,United States,I recently transferred through CVG for the first time in several years. I had forgotten just how easy it is to make connections at this airport especially on Delta flights. The terminal is spacious clean and very well- organized. And the Delta SkyClub is very nice - nicer than many of the clubs at ATL. Unfortunately the service reductions at the airport show as it was extremely empty with relatively few flights showing on the boards.,8,1
cincinnati-airport,Michael Rivera,United States,Fast and friendly service. Great terminals tram walkways and food courts. Easy to navigate with lots of information about flights.,5,0
cincinnati-airport,K Van Houw,,Terminal 2 is not closed. It looks a bit dated (like it was built in the 70s well it was) but is efficient in serving its purpose. Overall a very easy airport to connect through everything is set up logically. For originating and departing traffic you can get between parking and your gate quickly even at peak departure times. TSA does a much better job here than I've seen at other airports. It's a shame Delta is in the long slow process of de- hubbing it in favor of ATL and DTW but that was inevitable post Northwest merger considering the simple geography of CVG being between the two.,4,0
cincinnati-airport,M Baughman,,CVG has been decimated by the Delta/Northwest merger. Delta has mostly moved out and the airport seems abandoned - much like Pittsburgh. It's a shame to watch this airport build up from nothing return to its modest origins. Delta's Chitauqua Airlines regional jets are now pulling up to Terminal A gates while Delta tries to put ComAir (in dreadful remote Terminal C) out of business. Terminal 2 (Star Alliance) closed altogether and I would not be surprised to see Terminal A mothballed.,4,0
cincinnati-airport,J Schmidt,,CVG is an easy airport if you're not flying Delta. If you are it's still not too bad. Terminal 2 restaurants are not too bad and there is now some food inside security. A big plus. Security at this airport is usually friendly and courteous but I've had my bags screened much pickier at CVG than any other U.S. airport to the point of almost missing a flight for the same bag and contents that caused no problems at other airports. It almost seems like security personnel are bored from few flights and really like to make up for it with those that are going out. Anticipate a little extra time for CVG security. Arriving and departing at Delta terminal 3 is more like getting into any other big airport but terminal 3 food and shops are far more extensive. It's more like a small Atlanta airport but the smaller size makes it less hassle. Arriving at terminal 2 is easy; as there are fewer flights. Unfortunately flights to and from CVG tend to be very overpriced since DL has a near monopoly.,4,0
cincinnati-airport,B Luchow,,Cincinnati airport is the most wonderful airport I have connected through. The airport's A and B concourses reminded me of ATL but much wider and easier to navigate. Someone told me concourse C is closed but I went there as I had a 5 hour layover and there were several flights. This is a very nice city with a beautiful airport!,5,0
cincinnati-airport,J Ludewig,,Not sure whether they changed the attitude but the custom office at my last immigration process in January was very friendly and even joked about the extended security installations aka handprint etc. I was thru in less than 5 minutes. A very good airport to enter the US. Little strange however is the extended security check right after leaving the customs area when you need to go to your gate for the next leg of the trip. The security there is a lost more restrictive than anywhere in the US not to mention Frankfurt.,4,0
cincinnati-airport,Douglas Weir,,Immigration and Customs were efficient and I was through both of these plus the secondary security screen in less than an hour in spite of being nowhere near the front of the plane and with another international flight deplaning at the same time. The immigration staff did all that they could to reduce delays by checking forms in the line and correcting them rather than making people go to the back of the line and fill the forms in again and directing people to the US citizen desks once these were empty. This is more than can be said at many east coast airports. The 5 1/2 hour layover passed relatively quickly as the airport had a good variety of shops and the restaurant meals I purchased were surprisingly good when compared to my usual experiences. I'll keep this airport on my shortlist as a transit point.,4,0
cincinnati-airport,Simon Blackburn,,Still my preferred entry point into the US - as long as the international arrivals haven't all come in at once and you're on the last of them! This happened once and the queue was over an hour. Otherwise it's usually very quick and easy and spacious.,,0
cincinnati-airport,Ned Hopkins,,CVG is a sprawling airport with long walks from one gate to another. It's not an altogether bad place to spend a seven-hour layover which is what we did between flights from LGW and SFO. Delta Airlines Crown Club is large with many amenities -- including a business center with a goodly number of computers connected to the inernet by cable. Getting through immigration and customs is a breeze -- making Cincinnati far preferable to the most used east coast airports.,,0
cincinnati-airport,J Ludewig,,CVG is generally ok for arrival in the US. Not too busy at immigrations especially when you exit the plane first and get to the counters first. However a very foreigner unfriendly attitude from custom inspectors. On May 14 they had 5 counters for US people and only one for foreigners. Considering all the hassle aka fingerprint iris-scan etc. that foreigners have to deal with it is hard to understand why the US treats visitors so bluntly.,,0
cincinnati-airport,Robert Clark,,CVG is a good plane changeover place especially after a very long day of flying. I was flying ICN-SFO-CVG-BWI. That first ICAO is Incheon Seoul Korea. Changing planes here was simple as the airport is not crowded at night and there are a few smoke spots in the terminal namely in restaurants. No drinks to be had however.,,0
cincinnati-airport,Andrew Turek,,It's been a few years since I was there but I left on a Sunday and found that I couldn't get a drink because of some Kentucky law that probably pre-dates the Civil War. Even in England we have long since relaxed our licensing hours and Sunday trading laws for main airports. I hope the same has long since happened at CVG!,,0
cincinnati-airport,Dan Neeley,,Although international arrivals are a bit odd (the problem of having to re-enter the airport has been resolved) because of dual desks the airport itself is flawless. The well designed terminals make connecting a breeze between inter-airlines. I have flown in and out and have made numerous connections at Cincinnati over the past 10 years and have only had a handful of problems.,,0
cincinnati-airport,J Ludewig,,Depending on how many international flights come in you can wait 5 minutes at immigrations or one hour as I did in April. Staff was a bit 'soldier' like but ok. Immigration officer was friendly. It makes no sense to me however that once you exit immigration to board another inland plane you have to go thru security again which took another 30 minutes. Layover times in CVG should not be calculated too tight.,,0
cincinnati-airport,Tom Birkland,,CVG is a better airport to connect through than Atlanta airport. The gates are laid out in a much more logical way the food and shopping is better and the Comair commuter terminal is quite nice and easy to use. The shuttle from Comair's terminal C to the other terminals is quick and easy to find and puts you in the middle of the other terminals rather than at one far end. It's a shame that DL doesn't use this hub more than ATL.,,0
cincinnati-airport,James Tanford,,This is not a good airport for international arrivals. The only way to exit the airport is first to re-enter it. Sound confusing? Once you've cleared customs and immigration and have all your luggage you cannot exit directly to the parking lot. The only exit is through the main terminal which means you have to re-check your bags and go through security clearance and metal detectors and then find yet another baggage carousel to pick up your bags a second time. The process is excruciating and long after an international flight.,,0
cincinnati-airport,A Day,,I can't believe that CVG is rated so high. I have flown through it many times on Delta and have always had problems connecting. Maybe they've improved since I was there last but the transportation system between terminals is awkward at best the waiting areas are always crowded and a couple times I had to sit on the floor while I waited for an available seat. I must admit that the ground staff I've dealt with is pleasant and helpful but in general I try to avoid CVG.,,0
cincinnati-airport,Iain Mottram,,I've used Cincinnati airport twice in the past year and have found it to run smoothly and easy to navigate. The food in the main international terminal is above average for airport food the terminal is also clean and well designed. The Comair terminal is also good to use with adequate food concessions and seating.,,0
cincinnati-airport,Philip O'Connor,,Cincinnati is the best hub airport I have experienced in the US. Immigration on arrival for non-US citizens is efficient and polite. The Delta terminal is bright and cheerful - and the walk between gates short. I would recommend this airport.,,0
cincinnati-airport,William Montgomery,,"I have been flying into Cincinnati Int Airport for 16 years now and have seen many changes. I agree that the fares are quite expensive however compared to Chicago Dulles Houston and LAX the Airport is in wonderful condition and the staff are friendly and mostly informed. I am not endorsing this port of entry into the United States for Immigrants but they seem to be able to move crowds quicker than everywhere else I have flown into. Additionally the Airport Security is proactive in Cincinnati. They have gone through numerous ""exercises"" to ensure they are ready should an event take place. This instills my thoughts about their concerns for me the customer !",,0
cincinnati-airport,D Fetterolf,,"I was also in the Cincinnati airport on 03/16/03 and agree with the comment below. We also were flying Delta. I understand the security issue but my first day of vacation was ruined because I didn't get to my final destination until 6.5 hours later than we were supposed to. To get rerouted into Atlanta and then go to my final destination of Panama City with a 2.5 hour layover on Atlanta - we didn't book our flight through Atlanta in the first place because it was more expensive. And to have a Delta rep say to you ""well if it's any consolation this doesn't happen all the time"". I've had nothing but problems with Delta and I've flown to many different destinations and never had a problem until I started flying with them. They didn't even give any meal vouchers or portion of your money back or anything. All we got was a pony sized bottle of water t stand in a line for over 2 1/2 hours with no A/C!",,0
cincinnati-airport,Mike Pinske,,I was very disappointed with my recent travel to the Cincinnati airport on 3/16/03. On this day the airport had a security alert and everyone needed to be evacuated from the concourses and sent back through security. While this would be a difficult task for any airport Cincinnati Airport was clearly not ready for such an incident. Very little communication or direction from airport officials was provided. I spent 5 hours in a line that I didn't even know where it was going and there was no one around to ask. I spent this time in line only to find out that my flight left empty without me and that I would be unable to get onto another flight for another 24 hours. It seemed that the airlines and the airport officials were at odds with each other and neither was there to help travellers. No hotel or food was provided as a result of these delays. Very little help was provided by Delta. Furthermore no one is able to fully state what happened. Based on rumors that I had heard from other travellers the whole incident appears to be the fault of security. I would like to reiterate that this is a very difficult situation for any airport to handle. However one would expect that airport officials would have been trained to handle such a situation. This is not the first security issue to happen to a US airport of a similar nature. For these reasons I will not be using Delta or making connections through the Cincinnati airport in my future travels. Other airlines & airports I feel would have been much better at handling this situation.,,0
cincinnati-airport,Tony Carlfeldt,,Terminal 3 (Delta) at Cincinnati (CVG) has one of the most efficient open and easy to navigate terminals in the USA. This facility is comprised of three concourses; A and B service mainline carrier Delta and charter airlines with concourse C handling all of Comair. Between Delta and its subsidiary Comair about 500+ flights per day are offered. The biggest negative about this airport are its outrageous fares. Delta and Comair comprise 93% of the flights at CVG and charge the 2nd highest average fare in the country (according to the USA Today newspaper) right behind Charlotte NC. There is no low cost carrier servicing CVG and only minimal flights daily by United American Northwest USAir and Continental.,,0
clark-airport,Marc Coleman,Hong Kong,"Chaotic, no transfer facility, must clear customs and pay departure tax. 3 people on immigration for nearly 300 people, both in and out. It takes 10 minutes a person to clear immigration. If it had not been for ground staff we would have missed connection. It must have a transfer facility, if not close it!",1,0
clark-airport,S Fletcher,United Kingdom,I used to fly into Clark regularly and preferred it to Manila. The airport was refurbished and appears new and all areas from check in through security to departure gate is fast and efficient. In 2014 there was a number of International flights including Emirates and Gulf air flying into Clark And there was a good range of domestic flights available including flights to and from manila. However after an increase in fees charged to airlines most of these flights have now ended leaving an empty unused airport which handles a few flights daily. The one remaining domestic flight to Cebu departs late evening and the terminal is deserted. This is a wonderful modern clean efficient airport that is underused as a result there is very limited terminal shopping / refreshment facilities.,8,1
clark-airport,John Lumby,Philippines,Outbound to Hong Kong 13 April. I could see definite improvements at this airport since my last visit. Much quicker through immigration both outbound and inbound. More shops available and eating establishments. Keep it up!,6,1
clark-airport,B Vincent,Australia,"I recently had a 7 hour opportunity to observe Clark Airport. Clark has the makings of a good airport but attention to detail is sorely lacking. First of all there's free wifi - but only outside the airport (and maybe in Arrivals) airside you'll have to pay 800 pesos to use the VIP lounge. Airport tax as of 1 Feb is up to 600 pesos so don't spend all your local money! Then there's the bins - what bins? If you want a bin landside you'd better head to the restrooms. And while you're there bring your own toilet paper. There's no spray either. Airside (after you've paid your 600 pesos) there is toilet paper and some bins although they are few and far between. If you're downstairs where the ""cheap"" airlines leave from don't expect aircon or PA announcements. Upstairs there is aircon and PA but good luck hearing sufficiently to understand anything that's said in most announcements (Qatar Airways was the exception). So-called duty free stores are quite egregious here I saw packs of 6 beers with a normal retail value of 180-200 pesos priced at 500. News stand? Actually there was a small kiosk that at least sold a few magazines. Free drinking water? In your dreams. As for vegetarian food options - just head towards the exit keep going turn right and wait for the next jeepney back to town. Are there any good points? Well they do have seats you can stretch out on and it is reasonably bright and modern but it's not a nice place to spend any amount of time.",3,0
clark-airport,Simon Martina,United Kingdom,I used Clark for the first time recently when flying with Emirates to Dubai. On the positive - it is spacious very clean light wide check in areas smooth passport control and a comfortable departure lounge. A welcome change to the drabness and congestion of NAIA T1. On the not-so-positive - the bus service from Manila is infrequent and the Philtranco bus timetable meant I had to arrive 4 hours before departure. There is very little to keep you occupied once in the departure area with no news stands and little eating and drinking options. The only smoking lounge costs 300PHP to use although they do include coffee and small snacks in the price. Perhaps things will improve if another one or two international carriers start to operate from here as potentially it can be a much better option than MNL.,5,1
clark-airport,A Canda,Philippines,So convenient to access compared to Manila. Staff helpful and checking-in quick. You can easily see how this eventually will become the main international for Luzon being that Manila is probably the worst airport in the world. Facilities still basic but cheap with lots of building going on.,9,1
clark-airport,John Lumby,Philippines,I have now used this airport twice recently. Nowadays it is busier and queuing at immigration for departures appears to be problematic at busy times. It took me some 45 minutes. The shops are adequate and the staff are friendly. Arrivals was good with proactive customs officers looking to keep queues to a minimum.,6,1
cleveland-airport,M Dubuc,United States,The security checkpoint setup in the main terminal is terrible. Congested too few lanes waits that require you to stand on steps. I flew through CLE two years ago and I thought then I hit the occasional bad day. Flew through yesterday was worse though not really that busy. What was really disappointing is that nothing has been done in two years to improve the situation. It's way past the time knowing these security stations are going to be a permanent requirement so Airport mgt needs to step up and get some over due renovations done. In addition the restrooms in concourse A are undersized narrow halls to get into then way too small with too few facilities. The rest rooms and security the Airport can do something about. The last comment has to do with the location of the car rental facility. Common sense would have had the facility as close to the airport as possible for customer convenience along the main road but no site selection put the at the end of a dead end street the bus passing empty acreage which would have been much more convenient.,3,0
cleveland-airport,David Lawrence,United States,TSA was very slow during Saturday the 9th of March - took over an hour to process us through the inspection - we made our flight by 1 minute. Spoke with TSA - I do not fly much and I did not think they were very helpful and only rude with their comments. Cleveland Airport were not prepared for the spring break travelers. The inspectors that allow you back into the country were slow - not enough agents on duty. My trip was nice except for Cleveland Airport.,,0
cleveland-airport,N Harrison,United States,Great airport! I stopped for a layover from LAX. What a difference! LAX charged $9 for a vending machine style packaged sandwich. At Cleveland I was able to get a Subway 6 inch with an orange juice for $6.39. The airport stores were all reasonably priced whereas LAX charges about 3x the average price. I was also able to get a massage while waiting for my connection. The place is clean easy to use and the people were friendly.,10,1
cleveland-airport,Steve Hedden,United States,Nothing fancy but perfectly adequate airport. Easy transit from plane to well-labeled red line train to downtown. Easy check-in at kiosk and quick security (I should note I was flying Delta and not local hub carrier Continental which may account for short lines). Seating area at gate was full but I was able to find a seat.,5,0
cleveland-airport,Dave Moorehead,United States,A nice moderate size airport that is easy to get around and make connections. Good experience in getting bags transferred even with short turn around. VERY unfriendly to travellers with laptops phones etc. that need a charge. Just try to find a plug. Very few available. CLE is VERY behind the times and non-user friendly for electronics.,4,0
cleveland-airport,James Burke,,I connected at CLE whilst travelling on CO from Toronto to Kansas City. Cleveland is a great place to transfer - it is not too crowded as most planes are regional jets it doesn't have the same volume as EWR or ORD it has a great selection of destinations and it is bright and clean. There is a good selection of restaurants and cafes and the bathrooms are clean. I bet winter isn't too kind to CLE but as long as snow is not on the forecast I wouldn't hesitate to transfer in CLE again.,5,0
cleveland-airport,C Scott,,I don't mind the airport everything is fairly easy to navigate except trying to return my rental car. Every time I have been here I find a new way to get lost trying to find the rental car area. They could put up some better signs to direct traffic. I don't think it should take 40 minutes to go from a hotel 2 miles away to the rental car area.,3,0
cleveland-airport,B Rodriguez,,Great mid-sized airport. Lots of direct flights across the US with no significant waits for check- in or security (longest I have waited is probably 10 minutes); easy baggage claim and taxi/train service. Recent restaurant and amenities upgrades have made airport very reasonable during waits. Very relaxing environment and friendly people. Challenge is limited number of European destinations.,5,0
cleveland-airport,Ned Hopkins,,Flying into Cincinnai from London (or any international departure point) beats the pants off landing at JFK or in Boston Atlanta or Miami. Baggage arrives more quickly; Immigration and customs are a breeze; and he airport is (by comparison) so small it's easy to negotiate. There are plenty of shops and eating spots. The Delta Crown Room is huge and open to first/business class passengers holders of American Express cards (gold and up) and various others. For travellers to the West Coast Cincinnati offers another advantage. Flight times from London (and I assume the continent) are just marginally longer than they are to East Coast airports -- and are less likely to be put in holding patterns. But flights from Cincinnati to the West Coast are almost an hour shorter.,,0
cleveland-airport,V Shelton,,Cleveland is a nice small airport. Getting from the gates to baggage claim is a short walk compared to bigger airports like O'Hare and LAX. This place is not even as crowded as Midway is. I flew out on a Sunday and getting through security was a breeze. I was about 10 people at the time going through but got back to Chicago-Midway and the place was crawling with people. Public transportation in and out of CLE is best by the train which takes you downtown. The amenities are decent for this airport a good selection of places to eat but nothing extravagant. This airport will not equal those like ATL ORD or bigger airports. Remember that this is a medium sized airport. Overall the airport was very clean and the signage was easy to read and understand. No problems getting in or out of CLE.,,0
cleveland-airport,Paul Davis,,"I had a similar experience to others flying out of CLE - compact minimal facilities. If you are flying to an international destination be prepared for a major disappointment - there is no Duty Free shopping at the airport. (At least none that I was able to find.) If you are looking for a bit of peace and quiet between flights head down to the end of the ""C"" concourse and take the elevator up to the observation level (level 2). This is a very quiet glassed-in area with a wonderful view of most of the runways and concourses - too bad the outdoor section is now permanently closed.",,0
cleveland-airport,Greg Estes,,This airport meets most needs adequately. It's not large and it does not appear to be very new. My one complaint about it is that all car rentals are located in a separate building in a galaxy far far away. A late arrival in bitter cold weather combined with waiting on the city-run rental car shuttle makes for an angry traveler.,,0
cleveland-airport,Jordan Leventhal,,Could be worse - pretty small (4 concourses). You could make it from 1 end to the other in about 30 min if needed. Check in is always fast and I've never waited more than 30 min. for security. Hard to pass time but they just added one of those stands to rent a portable DVD player for your trip so that helps.,,0
cleveland-airport,Alan Chick,,Fairly compact as airports go and the gates are a reasonable walk. The most frustrating thing about this airport is the total lack of shops and eateries on the landside of security. If you want to eat you have to go through security if you want to smoke you have to go back out again to the outside. Not a bad airport for changing planes providing you don't have too much time to kill,,0
cluj-napoca-airport,Eric Levéel,South Africa,Cluj Airport is getting better all the time. It is a fairly small airport but it is clean efficient and fairly pleasant. Expect long queues at security checks as Romanian authorities are very strict about this but staff are fine and helpful. Passport control is not a problem leaving and hardly one arriving. I have through passed Cluj Airport several times and never queued more than 10 minutes (even late at night on arrival from Munich). The duty free is small and not that interesting price wise two little overpriced cafés in the departure hall and in the international departure lounge. Domestic departure lounge is a bit small but domestic flights are only served by ATR planes. On arrival taxis are safe just walk to the official taxi rank and do not follow anyone asking you in the arrival hall - price is around 30/35 lei into town (7/8 euros). A very decent airport.,8,1
cluj-napoca-airport,Alistair Ozanne,,Things are improving rapidly since the last review. New terminals open and a lot more space but still a bit chaotic at times. WizzAir have introduced several new routes since they opened a base here. Beware: that the airport website is not providing real time arrivals and departures information. Beware: some over priced cowboy taxis are still lurking near the terminal. Best use the frequent and cheap bus service to City Center on main road outside the airport terminal. All in all an up and coming airport serving a vibrant city.,4,0
cluj-napoca-airport,Alex Rap,,Cluj-Napoca International Airport is a very small airport. First thing you need to know is that it has experienced a 550% increase since 1999. But it still uses the same old terminal building. They will open 2 new terminals soon an arrivals one in April 2008 and a departures one in July 2008 so things will probably improve in a few months. But until then it's best to know what to expect if you go there. Everything is small baggage reclaim area arrivals hall check-in area (the largest of all but still small) departures hall. This means that it's quite hard for them to handle flights with many passengers. A full A320 with 180 passengers pushes the airport to its very limits. However on departure if you are there with about 1:30 hours before the departure time you're probably going to be fine. You will be queuing almost all that time (there's no real place for shopping or relaxing anyway). On arrival expect long queues for passport control. There are only 2 immigration officers processing (between them) only about 5 passengers per minute. If you're last to leave the aircraft you can expect an approximately 30 mins wait. Baggage reclaim area will be overcrowded so you'll have to wait a bit in there as well. The airport is about 8km east of the city centre and a taxi drive should take about 15-20 mins and cost approximately 15 lei (4 Euros). There is a bus stop (100m walk from the terminal) but I never used it. An overall fair experience if you know what to expect.,3,0
cochabamba-airport,K Beard,United Kingdom,This airport serves both international flights to Brazil and domestic flights with Bolivia with Aerosur. The airport has average facilities for departure however it is with arrival that the weaknesses of this airport shine forth. One small baggage area with an exit for domestic travellers no customs check required and one exit for international travellers with a through customs check result in chaos. The lack of baggage carts and hundreds of people struggling with several large suitcases each all struggling towards the one international exit result in a rugby scrum. When I arrived the one customs agent controlling the gate was also checking the other domestic arrivals gate. I only escaped after throwing my luggage out of the surging crowd and then dragging it back to the luggage area and eventually out. What should have taken 10 minutes took one hour.,2,0
cochin-airport,A de la Roziere,United States,Quick tips: When you're flying in carry a pen. Both customs and immigration forms are required but your airline may not provide you with both. When you're flying out (especially international) make sure to arrive as early as possible during peak season. If you're flying outside of the main tourist season you'll be okay if you arrive within the time recommended by your airline otherwise make sure to give yourself an extra hour or so. Be as courteous as possible do not act entitled and be careful when questioning the authority of airport officials. This is generally a good guideline for flying anywhere in India. People working at the airport will be happy to return the gesture if you go out of your way to show them some kindness. Arriving in India for the first time can be pretty stressful but I've seen the process become downright awful countless times as other westerners get held up because they acted contentiously at a checkpoint. If it takes you 90 minutes to get into Kochi you need a new driver. Granted Kochi is big but without traffic it takes only 20-30 minutes to get to Lulu Mall which is in Edappally.,7,1
cochin-airport,D Whalley,United Kingdom,As stated in other reviews the airport is clean and reasonably efficient compared to other airports in India. When we had a flight from the domestic terminal in February the queues for early morning departures were quite long. Both passengers and staff were tolerant and all passengers were eventually processed. Duty free is virtually non- existent especially in early morning when very little was open. A small but busy airport and one of the better ones to fly from in southern India. The main negative is the distance from Cochin a drive of at least 90 mins. We stayed at an airport hotel for an early flight and were glad we had done so.,7,1
cochin-airport,Manav Praveen,Oman,Very clean and efficient airport. Immigration officials are friendly. Not very big duty free. Best airport in Kerala you can visit.,8,1
cochin-airport,Albert Georgekutty,United States,Small busy efficient airport. I have been through many airports around the world and just like every-other airport Cochin has its own character. You will face the typical cynical laid back atmosphere and character of Kerala. The quality of service and amenities offered at this airport comparing to the economical status is extremely satisfactory. Keep a warm confident and positive smile on you and enjoy Cochin.,7,1
cochin-airport,David G Stein,United States,Small efficient and clean airport. Arrival was smooth it took no more than 30 minutes to go through passport control and collect my luggage. On the way home check in was quick. There was a seating area with soft chairs away from the gate if you had a long wait.,7,1
cochin-airport,Anushree Balachandran,India,I travelled more than 20 hours from Sydney Australia to Kerala and did not have a pleasant experience at Kochi airport. Having forgotten to bring a pen along with me I searched all desks at the immigration area for a pen but in vain. I asked an official and instead of handing me the one in his pocket he directed me all the way across the hall to a desk with a lady sitting behind it. When I asked her for a pen she suggested I go look at the desks and when told that there were no pens there started arguing with me until in frustration I grabbed one from her desk. And when I complained at the immigration desk the officer laughed it off and asked me to carry one in my hand bag. Waiting times and cleanliness was acceptable but service and attitude of officials was atrocious.,2,0
cochin-airport,Martin Thomas,Canada,I was flying Jet Airways to Mumbai to catch my flight to Munich with Lufthansa. Two officers checking the same document 2 times before you even check in with the airline. Another luggage scan to be performed before you check in your baggage. After check in you go through security. Men and women have separate lines. This is where I encountered the most incredibly rude security staff. Even Mumbai Airport staff were better than here. Just the attitude of that person ruined the whole impression about the place. I suggest the airport authorities should give some customer service training to these staff before they are put to work. Wi- fi did not work but rest of the staff was acceptable.,2,0
cochin-airport,J Cheriyan,United States,Me and my wife flew from and back JFK-Abu Dhabi-Cochin. The immigration officers are not customer friendly and fast enough to absorb the number of passengers. While coming back to USA it was difficult to find the departure gate entry because of overcrowding by general public. Somebody control the crowd for the convenience of passengers. The CISF personnel at just before the security/scanning check was very rude. Too many checks at different stages which is not found in Gulf or American airports.,3,0
cochin-airport,A Koshy,India,Small but clean airport. Things move reasonably fast with not much hassle. Duty free options are limited but the prices are reasonable. Adequate food and beverage services. Immigration officers could do with a smile on their faces.,8,1
cochin-airport,P Newburger,United States,I flew out of Cochin to Doha on Qatar Airways. QA told me to arrive at the airport 45 minutes ahead of flight time as I was flying business class. Fortunately I arrived more than 2 hours ahead which turned out to be barely enough time. On arrival at 6.30 am there was a huge slowly-moving line just to get in the international terminal. Two uniformed guards were slowly checking every boarding pass and passport. Just inside the door was an identical performance with another guard checking the same documents! As expected QA check-in was flawless. Immigration involved a slow line. At security everyone needed a body scan. The departure lounge when reached was surprisingly large and clean -- which was needed to recover from the entry process.,3,0
cochin-airport,Mark DeCosta,United States,I flew in from JFK via New Delhi and then to Cochin. It took about 45 minutes for the luggage to arrive we were the only arriving flight in the middle of the night. I had to go the rest room its dirty and the floor had water all over. The domestic side of the airport is severely lacking with regards to facilities and cleanliness.,1,0
cochin-airport,Dilip Mathew,Australia,Surprised by the efficiency and friendliness of all personnel - immigration customs airline check-in and duty-free staff were uniformly courteous on arrival and departure. The toilets were clean. Departure lounge seemed spacious but that may have been because ours was the only international flight at the time.,5,0
cochin-airport,P Cijo,India,Clean and neat terminal. Immigration department needs to increase their staff. Departure lounge is big clean quiet and facing onto the runway also comfortable seating arrangements. Big parking area with flowers and plants. Large duty free shop area with reasonable price. Staff all seemed smiling and friendly. Overall very good experience.,5,0
cochin-airport,A Patil,Netherlands,Flew in from KUL with AirAsia into Cochin airport. At the immigration counter the immigration guy even had a sense of humor. Once out of immigration and down to baggage hall there was a duty free for incoming passengers. After collecting bags arrived outside and there were no hordes of people asking for your attention. In fact no one approached us - we quietly queued for a taxi service (at the official counter) the driver came near the arrivals and took us to the taxi. Its a wonderful airport without hassles that are normally associated with travelling in India.,4,0
cochin-airport,A Babu,,Very clean spacious terminal. There was increased security with screening prior to entry into the terminal that took about 10-15 minutes. Once in the International Terminal baggage screening check-in emigration and security was all completed in less than 30 minutes. The departure lounge is comparable to any international terminal in aesthetics quite spacious quiet with five gates/aerobridges wall-to-ceiling glass facing the tarmac and runway and very comfortable seating with good snack outlets at a reasonable price and a large duty-free area. Staff all over the airport seemed very friendly with the sole exception of the security at the entrance who were more curt and to the point. Overall a pleasant and relaxing experience.,4,0
cochin-airport,Rohit Shastri,,A clean modern airport but managed by incompetents. It took 2.5hrs from entering the airport to getting into the departure lounge. Increased security is the excuse but it does boil down to very bad management. Massive queues in the initial security re luggage (45 minutes)  check in with Qatar was fairly quick (15 minutes) followed by very slow moving long queues at immigration control with staff working at a snail's pace ( 60 minutes) followed by personal and hand luggage security checks (30 minutes which involved manual tick sheets where each passenger had to be marked off involving 3 staff collectively looking down a list. As a frequent traveller I see many airports and this has to be the slowest and most badly managed airports.,1,0
cochin-airport,Arun Karthi,,Check-In. I was heading out on Qatar Airways to Doha and was asked by the carrier to report 4 hours in advance because of 'heightened security'. I will go to the grave wondering why they ever did that. Because since my flight was at 5 am I reached the airport at 1 am. The check-in counter was not opened till 2.30 am. Yes 1.5 hours spent sitting at the limited seating in front of check-in. Immigration - for an airport that has maybe 7-8 international flights leaving in a span of 3 hours in the early morning there are four immigration queues. The wait was endless and the x-ray screening process was confusing. I put my carry-on bags in one queue and then have to go for through a metal scanner two rows down. I don't get it: If you operate a process 7 days a week 52 weeks a year - doesn't it occur to anyone involved that there might be a better way.,1,0
cochin-airport,Jonathan Kelly,,Surprisingly big clean modern terminal but getting through it was a joke. From arrival at the airport to first clearing baggage screening then check-in immigration customs security and further odd checks took an hour and a half. Our flight to Dubai was delayed half an hour simply because other passengers were stuck in the bottleneck.,2,0
cochin-airport,David Leston,,Flew in and out of Cochin on domestic services. Considering this is the 'new' airport it was looking pretty shabby and the facilities are minimal. There's the usual stream of military-looking personnel checking passports tickets baggage labels(!) multiple times and for goodness sake go to the toilet before you exit the terminal - as they won't let you back in again. It is also worth mentioning that the airport is 45km outside Cochin so leave plenty of time to get to and from it.,2,0
cochin-airport,S Srinivasan,,Flew in and out of the domestic terminal on a recent trip to Kerala. I was expecting better given that it's a privately run airport. The facilities on offer are almost non existent - just a couple of shops before the check-in area but nothing beyond check-in except for a Cafe Coffee Day. The airport also seems rather small given the high amount of tourist traffic to Kerala these days; only one line for security and only two gates. We got to the airport quite early and thus had no problems with lines but the departure area became badly overcrowded by early evening. Toilets were disgusting. On the plus side the building exterior's colonial architecture is nice free wireless internet is provided the chairs in the departure lounge are comfortable and the small size means just a short walk from the terminal to your plane as opposed to an uncomfortable bus ride - and if you have a domestic/international connection the terminals are walking distance to each other.,3,0
cochin-airport,Arun Karthi,,I have flown in an out of Cochin airport around three times now (1 domestic and 2 international) and have been lucky to make it out of the airport within 10 minutes of leaving the flight. I agree with other reviews that it would help to have some foresight in their planning as the facilities seem too small for an airport that is already having the fourth largest passenger volume in India and looks to attract further international flights. The shopping options are at best a joke and could be done without. I would have like more information screens giving an updated status on all flights in the waiting areas. I wonder if the designers even looked at any comparable international airports for good designs. My rating - 3 stars - and a lot of areas to improve.,3,0
cochin-airport,J Taverner,,For a small Indian airport was surprised at the high standards. Having a major upgrade so scaffolding about. Public toilets clean and tidy. Lounge on left on entry is a joke but good coffee and toast. BTW economy pax can get in for free if they have a Gold Mastercard - no charge.,4,0
cochin-airport,Kurt Müller,,Departed around 10 p.m. and found check-in area devoid of any crowds. Then proceeded to coffee shop at left of check-in area which also doubles as lounge for a number of airlines (incl. Emirates). I doubt whether this establishment will still be in business on my next trip. They never served alcohol in the past but now they have even stopped serving soft drinks (cola lemonade). However they do serve Red Bull - go figure. They charge Rs 240 (around US$ 6) for a cheese sandwich - outrageous in a country such as India. Duty Free Shop prices are in US$ but no flights depart from here to US. If you elect to pay in a currency of any destination country (e.g. UAE Dirhams) they will overcharge you on the exchange rate and then again by not having small change. Total premium: 15%. On the upside: waiting time at immigration has improved but when exiting India your patience is sorely tried by the extensive scrutiny that Indian travel documents are apparently subjected to.,3,0
cochin-airport,John Lum by,,I wonder if Guy Liardet went through the same airport as I did? It was a shambles. Check-in was fine but the problems arose at baggage screening and immigration. It took an hour to clear those two obstacles as the security guard could not recognize two books in my suitcase and I therefore had to open my case and in the next queue airport staff were not checking that departing passengers had completed their exit slips for immigration and as a result many had to fill them in in front of the immigration officers meaning that it took 5 minutes to see two people. So by the time security had been cleared we had to go straight to boarding. No time for lounges duty free or anything.,2,0
cochin-airport,Guy Liardet,,Clean and well run if a bit spartan. Airside lounge very comfortable some catering. Both gender toilets clean and well maintained. There were however seven or eight administrative hurdles (X-ray this X-ray that boarding card emigration stamp this customs stamp that check again) to cross.,,0
cochin-airport,Vijay Sampat,,Cochin Airport is definitely in a higher league than any other airport in India. For amount of traffic handled the layout and size is more than adequate. Still not as efficient as it could be though. The desk placed in front of the security area was staffed by 5 people but only one was actually doing any work (checking boarding passes) whilst the other four were clearly not engaged in productive activity. I would have preferred to see what for Indian conditions is a whopping airport tax of Rs 500 (collected in cash and on top of the various taxes already charged to your ticket) being used to provide a wireless LAN instead of overstaffing by a factor of 5.,,0
cochin-airport,Zacharia Varghese,,"Cochin though the principal business center of the very small south Indian state of Kerala is hardly a grand city. I remember well the old naval station that served as Cochin's past airport. The new airport is leaps and bounds better and given the humble nature of its surroundings a marvel. Compared to other Indian airports this is undoubtably one of the best in the country. I have found service to be clean efficient and relatively friendly. Is this Changi or Heathrow or Hong Kong - no. Is Cochin in the same league with these places - no. Is the shopping great - no. Who goes to a Kerala airport to shop? (Although I bought a bottle of Grand Marnier there at an excellent price.) I must say that many European and American airports I have travelled through haven't the same charm as this small outpost. The seating in the waiting area though ""auditorium style"" is among the most classy I have seen in any airport and RS500 (~USD 11 only for international flights outbound) is not much for an international traveller.",,0
cochin-airport,Joe Sebastian,,This airport was opened a few years ago as India's first privately financed airport so when I went to Kerala a few weeks ago  I had expected to find a highly efficient and modern airport on a par with Singapore's Changi or KLIA. The terminal looks drab and antiquated and is already showing signs of poor maintenance. Facilities and shopping opportunities are very basic. When I landed there were only 4 immigration counters open and the small holding bay was absolutely packed with just one flight; when another flight landed there was no room to accommodate all the passengers in the immigration area. Unlike other Indian airports on departing we are expected to pay 'an airport users fee' of RS500 despite having prepaid airport tax which I thought was cheeky in view of the poor service. With private backing this airport should have been truly world class and a great opportunity has been missed.,,0
cochin-airport,Chris Matthews,,Inbound was'nt too bad with immigration completed quickly- but then we were at the front of the queue and those behind had a very long wait with only 3 staff working. Outbound was poor - not much attention paid to security- none of the usual questions etc  but all the bags were x- rayed. The worst aspect is the lack of any catering after immigration- you can buy a coffee but thats it!!! For an early morning flight we were starving and could have done with something a bit more. Beware of the unexpected R500 (cash only) airport charge which you dont find out about until you're checking in and all of your Indian Money is spent.,,0
cochin-airport,Varghese Abraham,,I have used Cochin aiport three times now. As expressed by other people the airport serves its purpose with no foresight and a vision for the future. The immigration and customers check take ages to complete. Why can't we Indians build more space and money into our mindset.,,0
cochin-airport,S Thomas,,I have flown in and out of the new Cochin Airport many times in the last few years. Even though this airport is cleaner compared those of Bombay and Delhi I find the amenities to be very basic. This airport is far below the international standards and I am sad to see the lack of vision by planners of this airport. The sitting area is so clustered you will feel that you are sitting in a big auditorium.,,0
cochin-airport,C Baroo,,I flew in and out of Cochin airport (Nov '03 & Jan '04) and found it to a clean friendly (even the security people had smiles) and efficient. A nice surprise after Bombay Delhi and Calcutta airports. If you're going to Kerala I definitely would consider Cochin as an arrival point.,,0
cochin-airport,Jimmy Jose,,Started with just 1 international airline and 1 domestic airline three years back its now serving 10 international airlines and 2 domestic airlines with a traffic of 250 flights per week. A new terminal complex coming up with all the latest stuff. This airport is dream come true for all the people from a tiny state called Kerala.,,0
cochin-airport,Angelo Castelino,,I recently flew into and out of Cochin airport India. There has been much hype about this airport as I understand that it is India's only private airport. The facilities are very basic and regretfully woefully small. It has the trademarks of Indian planning with absolutely no foresight. This much hyped up airport will be outdated and outgrown within the next two years. Typical of other airports in India. The Check In areas are small and so is the Customs and Immigration areas. I flew out on a Silkair A320 and still had to wait for 20 minutes at the security gate queue. Its a pity the CIAL has gone the AAI way.,,0
coffs-harbour-airport,A McNicol,Australia,Functional adequate satisfactory are descriptions that come to mind. Unlikely to offend but not memorable.,3,0
coffs-harbour-airport,C Tudehope,Australia,It's big enough for the number of people it serves on a weekday although I'd imagine it would get pretty crowded when the larger Virgin planes come in from Melbourne on weekends. The staff are friendly the facilities adequate for a regional airport of this size the queues managable and it's clean. It just feels like it's missing something. Despite it being refurbished within the last decade or so it feels like it needs a bit of a touch up-and the constant use of that sickly blue colour everywhere doesn't necessarily help the situation. So yes it is a nice airport in regional NSW that serves its purpose and the needs of the people but I just get the feeling that with a bit of money put in (new floorings lick of paint open up the departure lounge a bit more provide wi-fi) it could be have a certain wow factor reserved for NSW regional airports like Newcastle Albury and Dubbo which have been thrust forward into the 21st Century.,4,0
coimbatore-airport,Subramanian Vilayannur Hariharan,India,In my opinion airport is not at all up to the mark. Only one aerobridge 2 duty free shop No internet facilities 1 eating outlet. Needs to improve a lot.,2,0
coimbatore-airport,V Subramanian,India,This airport is of a very low standard. The baggage delivery is very very slow and not enough departure gates (only two gates are there right now). On the whole this is one of the worst airport in India.,1,0
coimbatore-airport,Warren Ezekiel,,Its a pity - the city of Coimbatore is growing fast at the global level and yet the airport does not cater to international flights except for the meagre Sharjah flight . Yes it is neat and tidy but it is also getting a bit cramped. The Government at the Centre and State could look into Coimbatore as a potential for international flights. The private domestic airlines had success when they were offered permission to fly there. I feel if foreign airlines are given permission to do so they will meet with success too. In domestic flights Indian airlines did not show much regard to suitable travel times to and from Coimbatore In the international side Air India has not shown any interest at all. I feel they think it would be a loss for them to fly there. So since they are not going to lose out on anything foreign airlines or other private airlines of India could be given permission to fly to Coimbatore on international routes.,,0
coimbatore-airport,Vasu Krishnasami,,The airport is tiny! Too many passengers use this airport. The potential of this City is enormous! Government needs to show some care for Coimbatore.,,0
coimbatore-airport,Sharon Wilson,,Contrary to what I had expected to find at a small domestic airport the terminal was beautifully clean well laid out with the benefit of some shops friendly staff who helped us through the security and check- in process. Ladies toilets (both Indian and Western style) were acceptably clean. A/C was okay if you were standing under it. I would have no hesitation in travelling through this airport again on future visits to India. Well done to those who maintain the Airport - keep up the good work.,,0
colognebonn-airport,Hannah Jan,Germany,"We flew to Antalya with tuifly and arrived at Cologne/Bonn by train. The way to the Check-in Counter in Terminal 2 was easy to find and also very short. We appreciate that the Terminal was not crowded, clean and bright. We made a little stop at McDonalds where we found a playzone for our kids. The big panorama windows allow them to watch the aircrafts on the aprons and a little playground with a plane and a slide shorten our waiting time. It was an enjoyable atmosphere and a very good start in our holiday.",10,1
colognebonn-airport,Rene Tailing,Germany,Enjoyed my trip to Mallorca with AB and CGN's Terminal 2 with its modern architecture. The check-in was hassle- free. The stuff were helpful and friendly. There was no queue at security! The waiting time was entertaining because of free wifi and the selection of restaurants and shops. The connection with S-Bahn line S13 to Cologne central station is okay. Every 20 minutes travel time 15 minutes EUR 280 one-way.,9,1
colognebonn-airport,Christoph Schmitt,United Kingdom,Great new T1 refurbishment completed. Light airy new flooring clean pleasant! Super fast security check with open minded and friendly and smiling personnel!,10,1
colognebonn-airport,Giannicola Bonora,Italy,Terminal 1 is huge for a medium city. Terminal 2 is much more light and airy but I have only seen it from the tarmac. T1 Baggage claim is the worst signposted among all the airports I've been. You have to search through two long lines of shops for the exit. Evidently they want your last dime before you leave. On arrival the train station is quite far. You have to walk all through the horseshoe shaped terminal building to the opposite edge then down the stairs to the train platform and up to the ticket office. S13-S12 lines are a very fast and cheap way to reach downtown Cologne and back. T1 is spotless as you may expect but it's a bit dark before security. The age of the building is more evident airside especially at the gates. If you are headed to a non-shengen country do not cross passport control too early because after there are really no thrills.,8,1
colognebonn-airport,J Eggers,Germany,This airport is unreliable in winter as it can't handle light snow. Got held hostage in waiting aircraft for 2.5 hrs following repeated de-icing repeatedly closed runway and broken down snow clearing vehicle on runway.,6,1
colognebonn-airport,Peter Simon,Germany,Probably my favourite airport in Europe. Security lines usually short to non-existent (although Monday mornings can take 10-20 minutes on a bad day). Free wi-fi throughout the airport a bonus. Arriving very pleasant too with immigration normally taking less than 5 minutes. Typically takes me less time to get from plane to car with checked luggage at CGN than it does to get out of London Heathrow or Gatwick with hand luggage. If departing from CGN late evening (or are delayed) there aren't a lot of shops or facilities open past 8pm.,9,1
colognebonn-airport,A Telman,Kazakhstan,Probably the quickest and friendliest border control in EU baggage arrives quickly easy to use and navigate through and friendly efficient staff. Very pleasant experience.,10,1
colognebonn-airport,D Griffiths,United Kingdom,I have used Terminal 1 at CGN many times over the last few years and with one recent exception I have generally had good experiences. Terminal 1 has an open airy feel to it and it manages to have a good range of shops and eating places without giving the impression that retail is more important than aviation. Surface transport links are excellent although signage can be a little hit or miss - my first attempt to find the bus to Bonn ended in the car rental area. Most recently inbound from EDI border control was painless with a welcoming smile from the officer at the counter. Baggage wasn't the quickest but it was still acceptable and I was on my way within 30 mins of landing. Outbound to MUC a few days later check in with 4U was a breeze I had time for a bite to eat and a visit to the Besucherterasse. However things were spoiled when I went through security. It wasn't busy so there were no significant delays but the staff who dealt with me were brusque to the point of unpleasantness. I'm an experienced flyer reasonably competent in German and not readily upset by airport staff but on this occasion their attitude was poor. CGN is a decent airport and could be a really good one if it wasn't let down like this.,4,0
colognebonn-airport,Murali Emani,United Kingdom,I travelled from Cologne-Edinburgh from the new Terminal 2. Its very clean spacious and a masterpiece to look at. The security clearances are very strict which is a very good sign for security and safety. The only disappointed thing is that there is hardly any cafes once past the passport clearance in gates 30-31.,5,0
colognebonn-airport,A Dron,United Kingdom,As efficient as you would expect for a German establishment and spotlessly clean. Decent facilities the only downside being that the queues at food and drink outlets were extensive although admittedly it was the evening rush hour. Overall I would rate it as between 'good' and 'excellent'.,4,0
colognebonn-airport,Ross Clark,United Kingdom,Arriving from EDI. Positives the passport check (I am not a EU citizen) was perfunctory and the baggage arrived quickly. Negatives - the bus to Bonn is not signposted and its frequency is useless by German standards (every half-hour) - in trying to get a ticket for it I ended up being sold a rail ticket that wasn't what I needed; and it is a very long walk from the terminal proper. Three stars but only just.,3,0
colognebonn-airport,Max Davidson,,Marvellously laid out quick and easy access from the terminal to public transportation excellent directional signage throughout the terminals and one of my favorite European airports.,5,0
colognebonn-airport,Brian Hill,,What a pleasure to use a smart clean airport; T2 is an example of how an airport should look and work. Even flying on a LCC easyJet we weren't treated like a second class user.,5,0
colognebonn-airport,A Smith,,This is an efficient small airport. There are good connections within Europe and some long haul scheduled flights (but not enough). The security process is relatively quick as is immigration. The restaurant facilities are limited but satisfactory. The transport to Cologne by train is fast but the bus link to Bonn although rapid is only every half-hour and has been reduced in frequency - a mistake that needs to be rectified. Still taking everything in consideration it is much more pleasant and user friendly to travel through Cologne/Bonn Airport than it is through a big airport like Frankfurt.,4,0
colognebonn-airport,Eduardo Räuchle,,Arrival at airport through railway station convenient but no automatic doors to leave station; not good when carrying heavy luggage. Signposting clear enough to me fellow travellers confused. Check- in spacious. Security checks slow due to under-staffing. Airside amenities basic and expensive. PA- system superfluous as not understandable. Toilets well kept. Baggage claim area cramped. Facilities upon arrival non-existent except for a bench outside the baggage claim area. Walk back to railway station through a roofed outdoor path next to the terminal building. In short: if you're able bodied alert and can make your own entertainment this airport is for you.,3,0
colognebonn-airport,M Jonkman,,Overall spacious and clean airport. Cheapest long-term parking P3 was full. Obviously not an incident because there was a staff member to advise about other possibilities present. Had to choose between queuing or going to P2. Travelling by GermanWings was outside Schengen which meant departing by bus from a (temporary?) big party tent connected to the Terminal 1 building. Very hot because of the sun on the roof. Passport control on return also in a tent. Bagage reclaim big enough (now?) no problems there. Picking up co-passengers after collecting the car from the parking turned out to be a big problem at least for Terminal 1. The natural place to wait seems only accessible for taxi's and the like. Advice: collect them from the departures level where they can wait on a visible spot.,4,0
colognebonn-airport,M Jerman,,At CGN Germanwings use their own terminal 1 which they only share with LH. Arrivals: Passport control and baggage reclaim in Terminal 1 old outdated and extremely small. Once outside you can actually start enjoying the airport especially when you reach T2. Very nice layout spacious lots of shops bars etc all in glass very modern. Connection on the train to the city centre easy to find and use. Regular service at very good price. Departures: From train station very long way to walk and not very good signposted. Once in actual terminal it all changes. Germanwings' check in area very big and spacious it was fairly busy yet it didn't look chaotic. If travelling with hand luggage it is possible to use self service check in which is easy to use. Security very quick and polite. Shopping good for the size of the terminal. If travelling outside Schengen my advice wait to go to your gate until last minute as once you clear immigration there is no shops or bars. No airbridges in terminal 2. Departures side of airport is very modern spacious clean good sign posted very nice to use. They need to do something about arrivals tho as it is not very nice and gives wrong impression. There is also a small viewing area on top of the terminal which is free and gives good overview of the airport.,4,0
colognebonn-airport,T Maresh,,CGN is a pleasant small airport. It reminded me of BRS except that CGN used a jetway BRS didn't. Train connection is kind of weird. I wanted to use my free luggage trolley to the train door which means using the elevators which never are easy in any airport. The elevators in CGN are hard to find and the buttons are really confusing with the labels not clear and worn off: I ended up on the wrong floor several times in the terminal and in the train station I ended up on the wrong side of the tracks. The train ticket machine wouldn't read my VISA bank card so I had to go back through the terminal and crazy elevators to find an ATM machine which did work to give me cash to use in the train machines. When I arrived in the Cologne Main Train Station the same type of machine accepted my bank card with no problem and a train staffer was there to help also. Also flying out be aware that you can't get into Burger King on the other side of security. The only normal place to eat is Subway and the attendants there ignored me so then I went over by the Continental gate for a German place for Cappucinno and Crescent which was okay. Otherwise just a handful of shops and not much else so just remember that it really is just a small airport. The security seemed okay but the security staff doesn't speak English and there's no fast line for guests who know what they are doing but otherwise no real problem. (I have a metal medical implant and am too familiar with security in many airports.) Okay that's all. Probably comparable to HHN (which I've used many times) but maybe better because of rail link and closeness to an actual city.,,0
colognebonn-airport,E Teh,,I used this airport in December 2006. It is a small airport with only very limited facilities especially on the departure floor after security. I also find that it is rather poorly sing-posted. It took me a while to locate the train station from the arrival at Terminal One. On the way back I had to take a long detour from the train station to the Terminal building. I was shocked with the smoking arrangement. There were numerous anouncement to inform passengers that smoking is only allowed at the cafes and the bars. Surely these should be the last place it should be allowed.,,0
colognebonn-airport,Mark Hatton,,Pretty good airport here mainly used for low-cost carriers such as HLX- Express and Air Berlin. Good range of facilities my only gripe is the wait between getting off the plane and baggage reclaim but otherwise a very good airport with all the facilities you need.,,0
colognebonn-airport,Jon Moody,,May 2006. Well designed calm and spacious airport with a fair range of shops / eating options for the size of the place. Rapid connection to Cologne Main station and then onto the rest of Germany by rail. Only one criticism - exiting the station on the way back I did a very long detour because the signs were not too clear but it gave me the chance to have a look around this pleasant airport.,,0
colognebonn-airport,Carsten Hesse,,Good airport following major infrastructural investments. Extremely easy to get around with numerous new shops being added recently. New transatlantic flights starting in May (Continental to Newark) and with the airport's great emphasis on low cost segment big future ahead.,,0
colognebonn-airport,Debbie Lewer,,"Cologne airport is one of my favourites whether it's the shiny ultra- modern new terminal or the 1960s ""old"" one which has a cool retro appeal of its own. If you're into architecture you'll enjoy it here. Staff are mostly friendly and chatty the atmosphere is calm and spacious and a good tip is it's got one of the cheapest duty free shops I have found in Europe (whiskey bargains to be had!) what's more at the ""old"" terminal you can walk into the little duty free and buy on LANDING which means if you're coming from the UK and wanting to bring your German friends an alcoholic gift it's by far the best place to pick it up and there never seems to be a queue. Only downside I can think of is that you need to be ready to walk long distances through its large spaces especially if you land at the old terminal and then want to get the bus into Cologne. However the S-Bahn link to the main station has recently been completed it's cheap and quick and at the end of the line lies one of Germany's best and friendliest cities.",,0
colognebonn-airport,Maurice Bender,,Cologne/Bonn really has developed within the last years. When I was young the airport served only a few European destinations and was mainly used for inner-german LH flights. Nowadays CGN is expanding rapidly since the no-frills carriers Germanwings and HLX moved in. The new Terminal 2 is a very nice steel/glass construction with a large departure hall and a lot of shops and cafés. Although Terminal 1 is more than 30 years old it still has a relaxed and cozy atmosphere. However restoration will be necessary in the future for sure. A weak point is the public transport system. At the moment passengers have to take busses either from Cologne or Bonn to get to the airport and back. A new railway station is under construction and will be opened on June 23rd 2004. I hope this will make the airport even more attractive as I really like flying out of CGN.,,0
colombo-airport,Brian Snellgrove,United Kingdom,The time was 3.30 am but the departures queues were fairly long. I benefited from having reserved my seat online. My main complaint is that the prices in all shops and restaurants are in $US. The prices even for a coffee are 3x the price outside.,5,1
colombo-airport,N Bartlett,Sri Lanka,Flew to Frankfurt with Sri Lankan and the check in was fast and simple. The airport itself doesn't facilitate many products available for passengers to use. Besides the Palm strip restaurant and the few coffee outlets there is nothing else. Duty free is very limited. Terminals however were very clean and the staff work valiantly to keep it clean. Arrival itself is a complete contrast. from clearing immigration till the point of customs you are surrounded by people shouting orders and is honestly one of the noisiest experiences ever. The staff are rude as they can possibly be. The airport is in need of serious improvements!,4,1
colombo-airport,B Giuseppe,Italy,"The worst airport experience of my life! I had to change flight here travelling from Rome to Male and on the departure day I had to wait about 8 hours. Dirty restrooms dirty floors dirty seats just a few shops to spend the time bad prices. Low quality food at the Palm Strip restaurant and in the end no one among the airport workers able to tell us where to find a lounge with an entrance fee to pay. We received so many different bits of information and were directed to four different ones all with no allowed access. On the day of the flight back to Italy due to a long delay we went to the SriLankan travel assistance desk and received a coupon for a meal. Again extremely bad quality at the Palm Strip restaurant where we had to ""choose"" among 3 dishes. Definitely the worst airport I've ever seen.",1,0
colombo-airport,Rohit Raj,India,Colombo Airport is in no way of international standard. The main area is a long corridor with very limited seats and on both sides of this corridor are the boarding gates. The interiors are very old and in shabby condition. The check-in counters are limited in numbers but they are never too crowded as the airport receives very limited number of flights and its main airline SriLankan Airlines too has limited flights. The immigration counters are also limited in numbers and the behaviour of immigration officers are pathetic. To me they seemed lethargic in their work and very callous in their attitude. There are very few eating joints and couldn't find a single international chain (KFC/McDonald/Burger King). There were only a few SriLankan restaurants serving SriLankan local food. It was surprising to see the very few duty free shops but a large number of shops selling kitchen and household items. The outside of the airport was very chaotic. No separate lanes for taxi/private cars or buses. All were in same lane.,3,0
colombo-airport,J Steinert,Germany,This is probably the worst airport we have ever been to. The interior was old and dingy. The people there were very unfriendly and didn't help us at all. We had a layover for more than 6 hours. We tried to find a restaurant and nobody could help us. Once we found the restaurant the food was terrible. Only good thing was that the prices for food and drinks were cheap. We didn't find a place where we could actually rest. Air conditioning was rare. Mosquitoes everywhere! We actually had to wear sweatshirts although it was unbearable hot! Thanks. Not again!,2,0
colombo-airport,M Ellwood,United Kingdom,Easy to navigate paying for a porter is the best advice as they will get you through quickly to the check in desk. 2 lots of security scans luckily it was very quiet when we arrived at 1130. Airport has a few shops but prices cheaper in the UK. Serendib lounge closed for renovations so had to use the Araliya Vip Lounge (travelling British Airways Club World) clean but very basic tears in the leather seats and not what you would expect! OK for a cold drink and a cake! Clean toilets.,8,1
colombo-airport,R Puri,Bahrain,Was in Colombo Airport for a flight to Delhi. The terminal is quite small and based on my observations receives much less traffic than regional rivals like Delhi and Mumbai. Checking in and immigration was pleasant with queues being very short. Ground staff did take some time to check us in but were friendly and immigration was fast and efficient. However the main problem with this airport are the facilities and cleanliness. There are no major international food stalls such as Mcdonalds KFC etc. There is only one small food stall area which offers a limited menu. There are very few shops which all sell the same souvenirs. There is also limited seating and the toilets were not that clean. Not a bad airport but should try and improve a lot if they want to compete with other south Asian airports like Karachi Mumbai and Delhi.,3,0
colombo-airport,Johan Harris,United Kingdom,"While I've got no qualms about their in-flight service or the entertainment system (since I mostly spend the time sleeping) I'd rather take a kayak back to Europe than have to deal with their ground staff once again. Unfortunately my company made that decision for me and bought the tickets with SriLankan a few times so far so I've had the displeasure of having to deal with their check in staff a few times in the past. I'm no stranger to their total lack of co-operation regarding anything at all but their most recent fad is just beyond belief - they flat out refuse to check your baggage to your final destination. Apparently they want you to buy your connecting tickets for subsequent flights directly from them in order to be able to use this 'service' that all airlines with an ounce of common sense provide everyone. In other words pay double what you'd pay normally to SriLankan Airlines have your baggage checked! Long story short they wouldn't check my baggage to the final destination and were being very rude about it (""no exceptions for foreigners!"" the staff simply turning around and pretending not to hear my question about why this ridiculous policy is in effect generally exuding an extremely rude attitude they kept me at the check in for so long because of this I nearly missed the flight etc.). I've been to dozens of countries over the past 10 years and never once had to endure what these people put people through at Colombo International Airport.",1,0
colombo-airport,Carl Borges,United Kingdom,A reasonably good airport there are some works going on in the departures area but they aren't causing significant problems. They need to sign board better trying to find the toilets was not easy!,6,1
colombo-airport,Charanjit Malli,Australia,Airport was really good a variety of shops and duty free range was good and quite cheap. Security strict which is good.,8,1
colombo-airport,D Fynn,United Kingdom,Much better than I had expected. Overall cleanliness was reasonable signage good and the aircon worked. Food and drink was decent once airside with adequate comfy seating. The check-in experience though was a total nightmare.,5,1
colombo-airport,L Felix,United Arab Emirates,A truly unpleasant airport in every sense. Wash rooms are dirty and smell appalling. Staff are remarkably rude. Very little cleaning is done and although the airport is only a few years old there is filth everywhere - seats with stains dirt in every corner. Getting a taxi from the airport means getting treated rudely by airport personnel. No facilities not a proper shop no adequate refreshments available no comfort. I will try to avoid visiting Colombo again.,,0
colombo-airport,N Sundera,United States,Having travelled through Colombo 4 times in the last couple of months I can say it is one of the better airports in the sub-continent which is faint praise indeed. The air-conditioning is anaemic the restrooms are only marginally acceptable the duty-free area in the arrivals hall is more like a bazaar with various traders vying for your attention. The drop-off area is over-crowded with people and with vehicles belching diesel fumes. Check- in is a nightmare with long lines and clueless ground staff. On the plus side the terminal is clean and well lit and less crowded past immigration and easy to navigate. Sadly the alterations and additions are very mediocre and the elegance of the original terminal with its colourful fabric ceiling have been long lost.,5,1
colombo-airport,Gyan Fernando,Sri Lanka,The problem with this airport is that it is well away from Colombo the only road can be very busy and therefore you need to arrive well ahead of time. Getting into the building takes a long time because of the security. The problem here is that non-travellers try to get into the terminal which is not allowed (except with a permit) and so the security guy at the entrance checks your passport and asks for your ticket. With e- tickets there is no need to carry any documentation and so this causes a little bit of unpleasantness. Once past security all baggage is x-rayed which is fair enough but there is only one machine. There is a lot of queue jumping. Once past that hurdle the next one is trying to get to check-in. If you arrived early you will have to hang around until the check-in opens. Once past check-in things do get better. Immigration staff are generally courteous and immigration is painless. Once airside there is one reasonable but overpriced restaurant. Service is slow. If flights get delayed do expect chaos with the lovely but clueless hostesses. It is very easy to get into the wrong area as gate staff are pre-occupied. This is the only International airport in Sri Lanka at the time of writing and therefore I have no choice but to recommend it but with reservations.,4,1
colombo-airport,A Stevenson,United Kingdom,The last time I came through Columbo Airport I gave it a pretty good review sadly things seem to have deteriorated - either that or the airport is struggling to keep up with increased passenger traffic. Flying into the airport isn't too bad although the pick-up point for arrivals is now as big a shambles as the drop off zone for departing passengers. Departures is a different story. Apart from the scrum at the aforementioned drop off point the check in desks are partitioned off from the rest of the departure hall and you're not allowed to proceed to check in until instructed to do so. Fair enough but the amount of seating in the departure hall is completely inadequate for the number of passengers waiting for their check in desk to open. Also there is only one channel through the partition and when check in for a particular flight opens this is immediately mobbed by the waiting passengers with no attempt by the authorities at managing the process or – heaven forbid – organizing a queue. Once airside things do improve but since passengers have already gone through full security screening at a) entry to the departure hall and b) entry to the check in area why is there a need for a third security check at the gate itself? Still not a bad airport but the management ought to think about making the departures process less painful for passengers.,5,1
colombo-airport,Kurt Mueller,United Kingdom,"The management of this airport obviously believes that ""queuing is good for you"". Try to depart from here in the early hours and you are met with an obstructed main entrance to the departure area where you first have to pass your luggage through x-ray machines. Then you get to the departure hall which is separated from the check-in area by - you guessed it - more x-ray machines. Perversely only one x-ray machine was working when I flew out so the queue was horrendous and completely disorganized. Surely this could be easy to handle particularly now that visitors to Sri Lanka who previously obtained an entry stamp in their passports now have to pay for a visa on arrival. Where is that money going? Another annoying feature of this airport are immigration officials who are clearly chatting away to friends or family on their mobiles while on duty behind the immigration desks.",4,0
colombo-airport,Helen Jackson,United Kingdom,Colombo to Heathrow check-in was appalling. We had checked in online and only needed to drop our baggage. Arrived in plenty of time however we were in the online check-in queue for 1 3/4 hours! Poor management queue jumping passengers not having checked in online group members appearing from all over the place. When through sheer frustration I complained there was a total look of surprise from an attendant overseeing everything - but doing nothing. It would have been quicker not to have checked in online. Needless to say I only had 15 mins to shop. Also whilst there may be many 'checks' several passengers were able to get water onboard without it being removed.,1,0
colombo-airport,Mohamed Shukry,Sri Lanka,Excellent airport however the government officials such as immigration and customs are very rude. Long queue at the initial baggage screening. No ATM inside terminal.,7,1
colombo-airport,Nigel Garth,Canada,Found the new addition to the airport very clean and spacious. The airport is not very large and easy to navigate. The staff are friendly and willing to help. Great shopping in the Duty Free.,4,0
colombo-airport,B Kil by,United Kingdom,We travelled from Colombo to Abu Dhabi yesterday. On arriving at the airport we were asked for our details and why we had visited Sri Lanka etc and we were pleased with the security in force on entrance to the Airport. However once through to check in this turned into a nightmare. It was nothing but unorganised chaos. We could not check in on arrival maybe we were too early no reason given and we could not understand what was called out and information given on the airport tannoy system could not be understood or even heard. Volume was far too low. People checking in after us were not forming queues but were cluttering up the area and making it impossible for people to check in easily when their flight was called. We have travelled all over the world first time to Colombo and the lack of organisation or any queuing system made it the worst checking in experience ever. It was not until a lady joined the officials on duty that any progress for checking in was made. We were at this airport for 4.5 hours and found it to be the worst system in the world. Once through this area to check in baggage it was acceptable.,1,0
colombo-airport,Dimitri Vassilakis,France,"My worst airport experience in more than 2 decades of frequent travelling! First of all  all vehicles approaching the airport are stopped by a guard who exercises a ""face-control"" - looks at the passenger and asks him his nationality. Any credible answer seems to be accepted since no documents are verified - I repeated 3times mine but the guard had never heard of such an exotic country called Greece - but let me through! At the entrance of the terminal queue for luggage screening -once inside 60 minutes queue for check-in then the gate changes 3 times! What is the point of having recently revamped the shopping area ?",1,0
colombo-airport,David Payne-Smith,United Kingdom,It has got its act together pretty well I think. Everything clean in the terminal. Business lounge okay staff great. Don't change much money here as not a good rate. Check in a bit chaotic but not bad. Good onward travel to Colombo Kandy (by taxi not tuk-tuk!),4,0
colombo-airport,A Stevenson,United Kingdom,A pleasant surprise the airport now has air bridges connected to a modern pier. This in turn leads to the first floor of an expanded main terminal in which arriving / departing passengers mix freely. There were several immigration desks open even though it was 3.30am and I was processed quickly and efficiently. Baggage reclaim took a long time - bags were added to the carousel painfully slowly and it took about 45 minutes to recover my two suitcases. Once through customs there were several currency exchanges - don't bother comparing rates they're all the same! Departure on the 14th â€“ nothing much has changed since I was last here. The drop off zone is small and chaotic with passengers having to (try to) queue up outside to get through the limited number of security / baggage screening lanes immediately inside. Once through security and into the terminal things are a lot more efficient although CMB remains one of those peculiar airports where the check in area is partitioned off from the rest of the departures hall and passengers are not allowed to proceed until the check in desks for their flights open. Fortunately there was sufficient seating while I waited. Once checked in and through emigration the airside section was spacious and comfortable if somewhat eccentrically laid out. For the most part the airport is by the standards of developing countries clean efficient and pleasant - I've been through worse airports in wealthier countries.,3,0
colombo-airport,J Schmerker,United States,Fairly smooth arrival and departure both in the middle of the night. Found a functioning ATM which worked and the arrivals info desk arranged a prepaid taxi for us. We took a local bus late at night for our departure; it left everyone off several hundred meters away as is standard. Grimy wait for departures to open. Can anyone tell me why they sell appliances in duty free?,3,0
colombo-airport,J Field,Spain,My wife and I visited Sri Lanka 12 in January 2010 and found the airport generally very good on all counts apart from a large cafeteria type restaurant in the departure lounge which served some of the worst coffee I have had for a long time.,4,0
colombo-airport,Kurt Mueller,Germany,Used this airport for departure on 30 Jan with a flight at midnight. What a zoo! Far too few entrance doors for the large number of pax to even get inside the terminal. Immigration a discrace for a country trying to attract tourists - with three or four wide-bodied flights departing around the same time only six immigration desk were open. Next organizational gaffe: CX and EK departures scheduled within 10 minutes of each other from neighbouring gates 8 and 9 with a shared security checkpoint. Our flight delayed by more than one hour due to this horrendous circus.,1,0
colombo-airport,H Gomez,Australia,Small modern clean airport. Has a fair amount of shops for its size slightly overpriced however not the ideal airport for a transit more than 1-3 hours. Take use of their stopover package which allows you to go out to spend time at the beach or to explore Colombo city though I think its available only for SriLankan Airlines passengers. Overall nice airport has the potential for so much more.,5,0
colombo-airport,Karsten Mengers,,I use Colombo often as transit airport Frankfurt-Singapore and cannot say anything bad. Airport is overall clean easy to find the ways and gates restaurant area is ok the transit desk is working well.,4,0
colombo-airport,P Harrison,,I must have been lucky because both arrival and departure on a recent trip to Colombo was very smooth. New procedures have been introduced to monitor swine flu with immigration officials sporting white masks - as soon as you pass through to arrivals all the locals are sneezing without any care! The security checks are still very much in evidence and with a constant military cordon around the airport. I was though able to be picked up and dropped off directly outside the terminal building. The airport has recently been modernised and has the benefit of the usual shops and restaurants - what I didn't like was the fact that the toilet attendants hover and expect tips and that once through the final security checks there is no access to the toilets from the gate area. Annoyingly because of the archaic Sri Lankan currency regulations everything is priced in $US,3,0
colombo-airport,Andrew Weber,,I flew to CMB from Doha and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the airport. I was through immigration and out of the airport in less than 30 minutes. The touts are numerous and best avoided. Outbound check-in area was nice and spacious. The duty free shops and restaurants are plentiful and toilet facilities clean. Overall CMB is a small yet modern airport.,4,0
colombo-airport,Naqeeb Isthiark,,Colombo Airport now has plenty of shops at the departure and arrival lounge. BIA needs more expansion and an expressway is underway.,4,0
colombo-airport,Kurt Müller,,Well the nightmare described by a contributor below has not improved - far from it. Somewhere within the mad bureaucracy a new scheme has been devised for departing passengers. You may now not be driven to the airport terminal by friends/associates. Instead they must drop you off about 500 metres ahead of the terminal where you are transferred to a rickety bus without A/C. How this is supposed to improve security (the officially stated reason) is beyond me - but it does provide additional income for touts who pounce on passenger's luggage and lift it into the buses. On the upside arrivals are quite smooth but that is to be expected at an airport with hardly any traffic worth mentioning.,2,0
colombo-airport,Steven Long,,The inbound is OK but be prepared for a total nightmare on leaving the country. Before you arrive at the airport you join a long bus queue to have your Passport checked. Then you disembark the coach and are met with a huge throng of friends and relatives seeing off one person. Then your ticket and passport is checked again before you get into the building. 10 feet further in all your luggage goes through X-ray scanners and you are subjected to a full personal body frisk. And I do mean full. Genital areas too. These soldiers are also wearing filthy gloves that have done the same thing to hundreds of others before you. Absolutely disgusting. Then you will probably have to open your case because none of the young soldiers/airmen know what simple equipment is. A camera battery for example. In a camera. I even had a Cuban cigar taken out of its tube and handled. All the time you are holding up the queus of people behind you. Then it's off to the check in desks down a short corridor to another ticket check point and luggage check. All this before you have even got to check in. I totally agree with Andrew here. I've travelled through most of the airports in the world and I have never ever seen one as bad as this. It makes Homeland Security look like amateurs. It's a fairly nice country but nobody has any idea of what they are doing.,1,0
colombo-airport,Arun Anand,,Modern construction and airbridges good shopping in departure including souvenirs garments tea etc. Plenty of seats and restaurants. Plenty of check-in counters and baggage carousels for collection. Taxi and forex conversion counters in arrivals. Immigration very slow and careless and not very co-operative or friendly immigration staff. My passport was stamped with the previous day's date when my flight arrived at 4AM the staff were so callous not to even bother changing the date on the stamp!,4,0
colombo-airport,Lasitha Leelasena,,New terminal building is a vast improvement on the old once. Good facilities air bridges and a reasonable number of shops. Immigration can be slow (as with many things in Sri Lanka). Leave plenty of time to get through security and immigration when leaving Colombo. There is only one ATM (cash machine) at the airport. On the day of my arrival it was out of order. So take some cash or travellers cheques. There are plenty of banks just outside the arrivals hall where you can change to Sri Lankan rupees. If you need a local SIM there is a Dialog shop just after the banks (near the hotel stands on the left). A local SIM costs Rs 1600 with Rs 1000 credit). Activation takes 2-3 hours.,4,0
colombo-airport,Russell Barr,,What a dreadful experience! Heathrow/Colombo/Bangkok and return. The outbound wasn't too bad but that was probably due to the arrival time of our flight at Colombo the immigration process took about 40 minutes but the return was a nightmare. Our flight arrived at about 1000pm and seemed to coincide with the arrival of several other flights - six or seven hundred passengers at immigration and about twelve desks but only four were being used that's about 150 passengers per desk after queing for over an hour the immigration official serving the queue that we were waiting in decided that he had had enough and cleared off - we were then told to join the back of one of other three queues. Another hour and a half wait and it was our turn my wife got processed but when it came to my turn the official decided that he was thirsty and was going for a drink. I tried telling the official that we were together but that fell on deaf ears and again we were told to join the back of one of the two remaining queues. Pandemonium broke loose airport security then stepped in and began screaming at passengers - almost immediately two more desks were opened but that just made matters worse. Never again. The security people were treating the passengers as though we were animals I appreciate that there are big security issues in Sri Lanka but our experience was totally unacceptable.,1,0
colombo-airport,Sukhith Jayawickrama,,The airport is clean and modern duty free shops are good and the staff polite and helpful. Check-in takes a lot of time due to the many security checks.,3,0
colorado-springs-airport,Billy Swain,United States,I have used COS airport several times flying from Nashville to COS and back to Nashville. Each time I have been there airport personnel have been very helpful and friendly TSA security officials have been efficient and very observant and the airport has always been clean. I would highly recommend this airport to other fliers.,9,1
colorado-springs-airport,G Irwin,,The lack of reasonably priced and convenient public transportation options to and from the airport is a major downside to this otherwise attractive airport. Why the city bus system stops just short of the airport is hard to understand without invoking a conspiracy theory involving the expensive and inconvenient commercial bus taxi and limousine services that enjoy a monopoly in this market.,2,0
colorado-springs-airport,J Khosla,,I highly recommend traveling out of COS if you live in Pueblo Colorado Springs even Denver! COS is a very cozy and convenient airport with easy parking check-in security and baggage claim. It's main terminal has 12 gates so it isn't at all huge but it is a very comfortable size. In the past several years the planes flying into and out of COS have sadly gotten smaller (think regional jets) and the routes served are mostly to hub cities. That said I would personally rather fly out of COS and connect than drive the extra hour and a half to DEN and fly nonstop because it is a lot less stressful. The airport recently purchased new furniture for each gate area and it is a vast improvement. They even have padded benchs in the center of the terminal that you can lie on and sleep before you fly! This little extra is great because let's face it when people come from sea level to 6187 ft it is nice to lie down and adjust to the high altitude. That said one downfall of COS is its lack of shops and restaurants though the variety isn't horrible. The free Wi-Fi throughout the terminal though helps compensate for this shortfall.,3,0
colorado-springs-airport,Jim Wood,,If you don't need to go to Denver I recommend COS as the best option for going to Colorado. Small but not too small; clean efficient quick and centrally located to most points in Colorado. Good quick car rentals. I use it routinely to go to Pueblo and Denver. Yes Denver as it can be more convenient and faster to get to a lot of places especially in south Denver. Remember Denver airport is 30 miles east and an expensive toll road from many points in Denver. Also traffic is very congested in Denver but only moderately so in Colorado Springs. Only problem I have is that most often (but not always) the cheaper fares are into and out of Denver.,3,0
colorado-springs-airport,Coinneach Fitzpatrick,,I fly through COS whenever possible even though I live in downtown Denver. Very nice clean simple airport. If you're flying on United the walk to the gates at the far end (the entire terminal is half the size of DIA's Concourse A) takes about 10 minutes). Security is quick and painless parking is plentiful and cheap and the concessions are good. The only problem I've ever had at COS is nothing to do with the airport itself; Colorado Springs is doing major work on I-25 and getting through the city to the airport can be tiresome.,3,0
colorado-springs-airport,Alex Porter,,COS is a nice airport and very efficient. Restaurants are good for a smaller airport and baggage claim wait was short. I really appreciated the free wi-fi internet service something that is often paid for in other airports. The only drawbacks are that it is far from the city so cab fares are high (plus the city bus system doesn't include the airport) and the terminal is so tiny compared to the airport as a whole that it takes a long time to taxi to the runway even with light traffic.,2,0
colorado-springs-airport,Eleanor McAleer,,This is a small airport so you will never get lost. I go there twice a year and have never been held up going through security for more than five minutes. The staff have always been very helpful. For such a small airport there are a few decent places to eat. I used to fly into Denver and drive to the Springs but never again.,3,0
columbus-airport,John Schroeder,United States,Dirty airport with very few direct choices. Always have to connect and always late. Not sure why nay major company would relocate to Columbus knowing that they have a sub par airport.,,0
columbus-airport,Karl Moosbrugger,Austria,Easy and pleasant smaller airport. It has all facilities required for a pleasant wait is spacious and never crowded. No wait times at security and very friendly people.,10,1
columbus-airport,H Lee,United States,Overall pleasant to fly in and out of. The facility has gone through a major renovation some time ago and it is still well maintained. Most parts including the restrooms are very clean. The main terminal is not so big but not too small to be overcrowded either. The parking garage is attached to the main terminal so travelers can avoid being exposed to the wind/rain/sunlight to reach their cars. A McDonald's is located within the airport complex. The landside and the 3 concourses are also fairly well laid out and dotted with decent number of eateries. In most cases the check-in and security check procedures altogether took only about 10 minutes for me and as the terminal is not too big even walking to the farthest gate takes only about 5 minutes. Of course TSA agents sometimes can be less than courteous. Baggage handling was fairly quick I did not really have to wait for more than 5 minutes until my bags were placed on the carousel for pickup. This airport offers free wi-fi and plenty of power outlets in between seats including USB power ports. My only concern about this facility is the lack of public transportation options. This airport is connected to the city by only two bus lines (52 and 92). Of course as this airport is only about 15 minutes' drive from downtown even a taxi ride costs only about $25 which implies a low demand of public transportation options in this region. Nevertheless I sometimes just feel insecure about the lack of public transits from any airport and this airport is no exception to that.,8,1
columbus-airport,S Chow,,Easy access. The airport is not crowded and very short wait if any. Signs were easy to follow and everything is laid out in a practical manner. There is free WiFi all over too so that's a plus. There's a decent amount of restaurant options too despite the size of the place. I also applaud the quick baggage handling and also the helpfulness of the workers in helping you find any misplaced baggage.,5,0
columbus-airport,Srimanikandhan Appunni,,Major enhancements have been done to CMH airport. The airport is well organized and has good selection of restaurants. We hope to have a direct connection to Europe sometime next year.,,0
cooma-snowy-mountains-airport,Roger Stone,,rather cold and impersonal although food shop and check-in staff pleasant and I was able to check-in over an hour before departure. Extraordinary use of loud-speaker systems inside and outside the terminal playing a local radio station at full blast. It seems this airport is owned by the local radio station so loudspeakers are used to blast their advertisements at you as you alight from the (Regional Express) aircraft. Beware that the terminal is shut until about an hour or so before an aircraft arrives or departs and one is forced to look for shelter where one can if dropped off a little early. Strange place.,,0
copenhagen-airport,P Gordy,United States,"It has become increasingly crowded over the years, there are plans for terminal expansion to remedy this problem, but it is unclear whether this will be completed during the foreseeable future. The restaurants are pricey, but Copenhagen is a pricey city, and most big city airports overcharge captive passengers airside. There are other problems and it is annoying for me to be set in the middle of the duty-free immediately upon passing security without the possibility of avoiding it. It gives a mercenary touch to what was, before the duty-free shops were moved to their present position, a pleasantly laid-back, but high-service airport. Not everyone wants to buy alcohol, tobacco, perfume and chocolate, and if one is in a hurry to make a flight that is far out on one of the concourses, the duty-free shops are a nuisance. The absence of seating in the transit halls is also a problem, which others have noted. Worst of all was the slow baggage handling. It took me at least 15 minutes to get from the aircraft to Baggage Claim, and when I arrived, an electronic sign informed us that there would be a 25 minute wait for our flight's baggage to arrive - a total of 40 minutes since the aircraft arrived. However since another flight's luggage was scheduled to arrive at the same time and was given priority, adding an additional 15 minutes before the first piece of baggage from my flight plopped onto the carousel. That made the wait for baggage 1 hour 5 minutes. Add 12 minutes for my bag to arrive, my total wait was 1 hour 17 minutes! Things were not always this way, and I am sorry that what once was my favorite airport has fallen this far. On the positive side, passport control for EU and non-EU residents was efficient and painless. Also positive are the various direct connections between the airport and center city - regional train, Metro, and the 5A bus, all either in the terminal or directly outside and, with the exception of the bus, all offering a rapid connection. Also, while many or most shops and eateries at Copenhagen Airport are exorbitantly expensive, there is a shop in Terminal 2 that offers items such as umbrellas, headphones, pastilles, and small personal items at a most reasonable price. Also, a few of the shops offer wares that are priced no higher than they would be outside the airport. This may be small consolation to travelers on a tight budget, but with 25% VAT, there is no way of escaping the fact that Denmark is an expensive country. As for queuing times at security, I have had both good and rotten luck in the recent past. I shall see what conditions are like on my return trip in 3 weeks.",6,1
copenhagen-airport,R Mortara,United Kingdom,I spent some 100 minutes at CPH during a transit stop last week. It's full of shops and there are plenty of eating options. The one thing which amazed me (positively) was there was no security check for passengers changing planes especially those going between schengen and non schengen services. Yes they check passports but no scan of hand luggage or passengers. Unusual in this day and age. It means you can buy water at your first airport and still take it onto the second flight which is helpful. Not sure if this is the norm but it made the transit process much quicker.,7,1
copenhagen-airport,S Avinit,United States,We used this airport for both arrival and departure and found it to be a relatively small but cozy airport as compared to other European airports. Overall the airport is clean with the exception of restrooms - restrooms were not dirty but there were not very clean either. It is easy to navigate in the airport with brightly colored signs in both English and Danish. It also has a fine number of restaurants and snack bars offering all kinds of meals - fruit / juice bar sandwiches hot food - and not to forget the cafes with Danish coffee and pastries! The baggage claim is on the first floor where there are also currency exchange counters. After the baggage claim one can take the bus (outside the airport) or the train (in the basement) that provides services to Copenhagen Central Station that in-turn provides service to must of Europe - it is very convenient to use public transportation to and from this airport. The duty free shops have a fair collection of merchandise and the prices are reasonable. I would use this airport again!,9,1
copenhagen-airport,R Bradley,United Kingdom,At first sight a nice airport but once you see beyond the veneer you realise it's designed for the retailer not the passenger. Lots of shops but very few seats before passport control. Once through passport control no organisation or facilities outside gate so everyone in a huddle standing or seated on floor waiting for gate to open at which point mass crowd. Ryanair might not be friendly but at least they are normally efficiently organised. Oh and no announcements of delays and once in gate departure area can't see screens. Good job I checked online!,2,0
copenhagen-airport,D Leston,United Kingdom,CPH worked very efficiently on my recent visit although I can see what people mean about the long distances you have to walk. Be sure to leave yourself plenty of time to get to your gate if you're arriving at the airport on the train especially if you're departure is from anywhere other than terminal 3. Security was busy but relatively quick. Loads of facilities airside but pricey.,7,1
copenhagen-airport,H Oberbeckmann,Germany,I have been flying in and out of this airport to visit Copenhagen. The Terminal was quite clean upon arrival it was easy to find the exit and the railway station and the airport has a good connection to the local public transport. When flying back home the check-in area was crowded but it didn't take long to drop the bags anyways. There are lots of shops and restaurants inside the security area and one can perfectly observe the traffic outside from the big windows in the gate areas.,10,1
copenhagen-airport,E Jensen,Denmark,"Check-in is poor. Even if checked-in online and baggage labels printed you end up waiting in queue to drop the baggage. Security is normally OK but quite often with delays. Most of the terminal area is like a shopping center without proper facilities for just waiting/relaxing without having to spend money. Departing/arriving via the ""F"" gates is a disgrace and proves that customer service just doesn't exist in Kastrup. Always queues at immigration and endless walking both at departure and arrival for no purpose except to annoy passengers.",3,0
copenhagen-airport,S Rasmussen,Lithuania,Waited 40 minutes in the queue before security and this was a Tuesday at 10.45. After security one enters directly into a tax free shop - rather irritating and a problem if you're in a hurry. Toilets far between the one visited was filthy and badly smelling. Prices for food and drink are too much - I had to pay $11 for a cup of coffee. All other prices double of any other place in Copenhagen. The airport looks nice but with inefficient security staff filthy bathrooms and prices above the skies it's better to avoid it.,4,0
copenhagen-airport,S Richardson,United Kingdom,Transited through CPH routing BUD-LGW. I had high expectations of this airport after hearing about it being a '4 star airport' and it being in Scandinavia but I was bitterly disappointed. The lack of seating is just completely unacceptable! There are shops here the size of main department store shops and they are just one after another. The number of food options is also excessive. Seems the airport just wants you to spend as much money as possible and forget about the seating. It didn't even seem that busy when I was here and there were people sitting on the floor.. One of the poorest airports I've been to and definitely the worst airport in Scandinavia. CPH managers - take a look at ARN and you'll learn a lot!,3,0
copenhagen-airport,P Shepherd,United Kingdom,"Queue for 50+ minutes to even get to the security check even though the active signs are saying ""queuing time 21 minutes"" - far too few staff.

copenhagen-airport,Gorm Teichert,Denmark,"Advertisement on posters States ""the world best security service"" this should be changed to ""the worlds slowest security service"" there are a bit of humiliation involved when standing in line for a long long time when only half or less security points are operating it's crazy. The posters about the world leading service only makes it worse. Also Copenhagen airport is the slowest in getting baggage. Often you will enter baggage arrivals hall with the message of 25 min to luggage arrival this is bad.",1,0
copenhagen-airport,Maurice Davies,United Kingdom,Huge queues at security with about a third of the lanes firmly shut even though it claims best security in the world. And only two passport windows open which is a bit rubbish too. The wifi wouldn't let me register. They are not as good as they like to think they are.,4,0
copenhagen-airport,Lydia Kretzschmar,Germany,It feels a bit crowded and rather packed. Therefore the overall clarity of the infrastructure suffers. I'm also not too fond of the food and beverage selection. Copenhagen Airport could attract more restaurants/shops that offer healthy foods instead of burger sandwiches and hot dogs only. Prices are exaggerated. Furthermore there seemed to be issues with the baggage handling. I waited 20min for my suitcase upon arrival.,5,1
copenhagen-airport,Hans R T Hansson,Australia,Everything seems to work at this airport. Check in is easy and you are informed about the waiting time through customs and baggage control. There are plenty of restaurants catering for most and I just find the airport being user friendly.,10,1
copenhagen-airport,J Pope,United Kingdom,"Disappointing experience. Very long unassisted walk from and to ""F"" gates in Terminal 2 an unacceptable 45 minutes queuing for Security. Understaffed passport check points resulted in further long queues - leaving very little time in the overpriced shopping mall that appears to be this airport's most attractive facility!",2,0
copenhagen-airport,Jean Wagstaffe,United Kingdom,The time in the airport was fine but my complaint is the price of 2 coffees and 1 muffin at Starbucks which was 117 Kroner or £13.There was a billboard outside the unit advertising a deal for coffee and a Danish pastry but apparently this deal finished at 11.am. This must be the most expensive coffee in Europe.,8,1
copenhagen-airport,Cliff McGillivray,Australia,This complaint is specifically about the business lounge facilities (or rather the lack of) at Terminal 3. Firstly the choice of food is miserable in fact the worst in any business lounge I have ever been to the world over. There is a lack of seating with powerpoints and suitable desks for doing laptop work. The wifi also has low spots about the lounge so I had to wander around trying to find good signal where there was a seat available. When you pay huge sums of money for business class so you can do business when travelling this is totally unacceptable.,,0
copenhagen-airport,J Erkens,United States,Staff are friendly but the facilities are terrible. There is not nearly enough seating - people just sit on the floor. Restrooms are marginally clean. I was unable to access wifi. And everything is quite expensive.,2,0
copenhagen-airport,K Taymor,France,We were stranded here overnight because of the storm and we waited about 4 hours to be rebooked by which time there were no more hotels. We were given blankets pillows and water as well as meal vouchers. The staff were very helpful and friendly despite passengers kicking off. Airport facilities are great even if quite expensive- but that's more to do with Danish prices generally. Floors are not comfy and the seating could do with a revamp. Free unlimited wifi was a godsend.,9,1
copenhagen-airport,Tom Gilb,Norway,I wish they would give free wifi like Oslo. Stockholm and other passenger friendly airports do. Instead they greedily want to force you to sign up for their advertising. I did not fall for their consumer trap. I highly dislike the airport for this arrogant unenlightened policy. They have the cheek to claim that they are thinking of the best for passengers. This lack of wifi ruined my stay there. Happily I am now at Stockholm airport so I can use their good free wifi offer to complain! Finally when will airports give us water fountains. Or is it about selling water bottles? When will they begin charging for toilets and breathing the air?,5,0
copenhagen-airport,David Stewart,United Kingdom,"Not an international airport as laughably marketed. Staff don't show up until 5.00 at the earliest and anyone checking in for an early flight that has been booked via a third party will have to wait until two hours before departure to check in. Denmark thinks the entire world relies on online check-in - still unavailable to many. 7/11 is the only available option in Terminal 2. Staff highly regulated by the typically officious Danish Trade Unions who restrict hours and the petty Scandinavian obsession with ""Green"" policies means you cannot fly until after 5.30 in the morning. If you have been to a real international airport before this one will disappoint. Toilets are passably clean and the wifi is good - so this place will please the most anal of travellers but as a flight hub - forget it. Denmark boasts about being ""The World's Best Society"" - with the zero smiles rudeness and cold atmosphere drunken loud early morning folk and not much fun for passengers. In Europe it's Heathrow every time as the only sensible hub if you are after common sense and a little more than the one coffee shop on offer here. Vienna a far better hub for example. Security queuing times a disaster area. Seating for the endless queues of passengers waiting for the staff to turn up to work non-existent. Copenhagen airport remains the world's most over-hyped airport. You could not make it up.",,0
copenhagen-airport,Clive Dyer,United Kingdom,I have traveled extensively for business and leisure and this is the worst airport I have come across. Security staff are rude and aggressive. I spend a lot of time preparing for screening including removing my hearing aids. Despite this I was given search by a man who would not accept that I could not hear him. I was treated like a criminal for having a plastic comb and handkerchiefs in my pocket. Baggage handing is poor and carousel a very long walk from the plane. In general there are very long walks at both arrival and departure. Seating is poor and prices very high. I will not fly to Denmark again after this.,,0
copenhagen-airport,Anders Pedersen,Denmark,I have passed CPH twice last month and found nothing to point fingers at despite peak season: spotless easy check-in security fast and staff smiling and joking lounges 25% crowded (29/7 - Servissair) which is absolutely acceptable. Fast immigration/disembarkation procedures (1 minute waiting each way). Prices exorbitant (like in many other airports). A/C working well quiet except in gate areas. Good view and fast transfers and taxi'ing as the airport is small - but modern. I like CPH.,8,1
copenhagen-airport,J Uusmaa,Finland,Expensive crowded airport that is clearly past it's prime. Lounges are busy and crowded to the point that the whole idea of lounge and quiet area with privacy has flown out the window Restaurants are extremely expensive and frankly do not offer value for money. Baggage handling system and quality of employees assures that more often than not bags do not connect even if there is an hour or more between flights. Unfortunately I transit Copenhagen a minimum of twice a month some times up to 4 times I cannot recommend this airport for a transit stop. If you travel to and from Nordic countries try Oslo Helsinki Stockholm and Keflavik.,,0
copenhagen-airport,L Cooper,Netherlands,"I travel monthly in Europe United States and Asia. But nowhere in the world have I encountered such drastic measures as at ""security"" of Copenhagen airport. Some of my toiletries were confiscated not because they exceeded the 100ml containers but because they didn't fit in their sealed 1liter thin plastic bag. I do travel with many creams since I have a skin condition and need them. I have been traveling since 2001 with a thicker plastic bag that is a bit larger than 1 litre. This was the only airport security in the world that didn't allow me to travel with my plastic bag. They treated me like a criminal for bringing 4 small 25ml containers more than allowed - not being able to fit in their sealed plastic bag. It must be sealed they said. The security guard thinks militaristically. Rules are rules and none can be bent under any circumstances. A travesty of security as if I were a threat.",,0
copenhagen-airport,P Cullen,United Kingdom,An intra-Schengen transit was painless. The facilities were good and I found plentiful seating with good views though I did have to walk a little way from the gate I arrived at and departed from (which were adjacent). I had a snack that was expensive - more so as I did not have any Krone. Generally though a good experience for me.,8,1
copenhagen-airport,D Cox,United Kingdom,I passed through CPH early on the morning of June 29th 2013 on my way to London from Wroclaw. First impressions are of a clean airy terminal building. Pros: Walking around the departures area even early on a Saturday morning there was a good variety of food available. No problem navigation around the airport to my departure at D101. Cons: Toilets need an overhaul. Though all flush and tap controls are operated via infrared the surrounding walls looks tired and dirty. Prices for anything are extremely expensive even compared to LHR.,6,0
copenhagen-airport,G Johnson,Sweden,Departure: excellent. Clean calm efficient and lovely. Good mixture of shopping and food. Light and modern. Great experience. Arriving: passport control nice and easy but sometimes not enough staff. Baggage claim is terrible. Always takes forever for luggage to arrive after a flight.,7,1
copenhagen-airport,M Waldie,Canada,"Almost no seating at all in the departure areas. In one area the only seating was some square blocks of granite. Most people had to sit on the floor. In another area there was a few (but not enough) chairs and they were really cheap. I've never been in a worse airport. As an aside make sure you know in advance that this is a ""silent airport"" (no announcements of boarding). You just look at the sign above the gate then watch the crowds rush up.",,0
copenhagen-airport,Paul Hampson,Greece,The last 2 times I have flown through Copenhagen they have shown that they are completely unable to handle the inevitable problems that occur. The first time I had to go from Copenhagen to Sweden and on to Helsinki. The flight was so late that they knew I would be stranded in Sweden but still I had to complain to get them to move me to a later flight which was direct to Helsinki. 2 weeks later I was due on the 17.10 flight from Copenhagen to Helsinki. They first said it was expected to leave at 17.15 then at 17.15 they said 18.15 and they continued in this fashion all the while the passengers had nowhere to sit (no gate offered and all seating is at the gates) so passengers ended up stood in front of the information board for hours. Staff don't do you any favours without complaining so at 17.20 I got them to change me to 18.45 flight to Helsinki (they admitted it hadn't even taken off from Helsinki). However they didn't change the luggage (despite there being 1.5 hours in between my changing to the flight and the flight leaving). Consequently I had to file a lost baggage claim in Helsinki and received it the next day. If you are unlucky enough to have to fly through Copenhagen be aware they will try to down play any problems so that you don't try to get them to change flights and they do not care if you are inconvenienced (even if you are stranded in another airport).,,0
copenhagen-airport,Alan Mackenzie,Denmark,I use Copenhagen airport roughly once a month. Passengers are in my opinion well served in this modern up-to-date airport. The airport has over the years developed improved passenger 'self-service' which speeds up the process of getting to your gate. The latest development is scanning machines just before security. These automated gates allow entry on reading your boarding card much the same as the London Underground ticket gates. The next improvement due in 2013 (which I'm looking forward to) is 'self-service baggage drop' where passengers can simply drop off their bags without standing in those endless snaking lines. To start with eight self-service bag drops will be opened in Terminal 3 and four in Terminal 2 and the service will initially only be available to passengers flying SAS and Norwegian.,10,1
copenhagen-airport,A Sibly,United Kingdom,Surprised no one else mentions lack of seating. Very few seats between security and other side of gate. Space all taken up with shops and paying restaurants. Gate only opened 30 minutes before take off and could finally find a proper seating area. Otherwise airport worked efficiently day we were there.,4,0
copenhagen-airport,N Juretic,Croatia,Went through this airport a week ago because of a connecting flight. I just had hand luggage but I noticed that passengers with baggage could pick up their baggage from the conveyor belt some 12 minutes after arrival. Instructions about baggage and the right conveyor belt were clear and accurate. It was easy to navigate through the airport. Staff were very friendly. SAS airline staff at the airport was polite and helpful as they helped me check in (I lost my reservation number on the previous flight so I couldn't use the machine to check in). Security check went ok and fast. Everyone was pleasant. I didn't like the fact that airport gives you only 15 min of free wifi. There is no recharge point and you can find a power plug only in some restaurants and cafes which are far too expensive and do not accept diners card and can't return cash in euros. The exchange office was very far away. No automatic ones. Still found some friendly employees in one café that let me use a power plug for free. Boarding was ok. The waiting area is a bit dull though. Had no problems finding my way to the gate because signs are very clear.,7,1
copenhagen-airport,J Zink,United Kingdom,I travel frequently to Copenhagen with two small children to visit family and despite the nice shops and interior this is eaily the worst airport I have ever been to with kids. As the only airport I have ever encountered staff do not allow through security small foldable buggies built for airport travel. They claim the union wont allow staff to carry them down the stairs by the aircraft. Travelling as a single parent with a 10months and two year old trying to manage from check-in to the plane is a true nightmare and staff does not offer any help but feel righteous as they simply follow rules. Dreadful and shameful!,3,0
copenhagen-airport,Robert Simpson,United States,The terminals are always busy but for some reason there is always a calm atmosphere. From an architectural point of view CPH gets top marks as well. The combination of Danish design and the hardwood floors is something I have never seen anywhere else in the world. Shopping facilities are great and the food selection good too (a little expensive). You get some excellent views of the airfield - very nice experience indeed.,10,1
copenhagen-airport,J Petersson,Sweden,Used this airport again and nothing has improved. Everything is still all about forcing you into the expensive shops to make them get your money. All areas without shops are more or less uninviting and seem to be deliberately neglected. The staff every time I go through security at CPH I'm so happy to be fluent in Danish since those who aren't are in for some rude high-handed treatment. Arrivals is also an unpleasant story: On a busy Monday evening they used only 2 of the 9 baggage belts; one belt for each handling agent. Fill the area with some plane-loads of impatient and grumpy Scandinavians plus tired confused tourists and make us wait and wait and wait the only thing you get is chaos.,2,0
copenhagen-airport,M McManus,United Kingdom,Arrivals and baggage claim in Terminal 3 was very crowded with some impatient people around. The airport has a quick train link (15 minutes to downtown) with the city centre. Its best to buy your ticket to downtown from the staff-manned booths as the machines aren't very straight forward. Airport is also useful for people traveling to nearby Malmo in Sweden which also has a train link to Copenhagen airport. In departures once you get security side there is a very good selection of restaurants cafes and duty free shops.,7,1
copenhagen-airport,Kim Thomsen,United Kingdom,While terminal 2 of Copenhagen airport does show its age this is still a charming place to go through. Speedy checking with only a few minutes in the queue. Practically no waiting time at security with friendly and helpful staff both places. Shops are a bit on the pricey side but they do have a wide selection and if you know the normal high street prices you can be lucky and get a bargain. Restaurants are excellent and can be recommended. It can be a bit of a walk from the lounges to the gates and occasionally the queue at passport control can be long but often you wait no more than 5 minutes to get through. Copenhagen Airport is an charming old airport that has managed to follow the times and is still a pleasant experience to go through.,8,1
copenhagen-airport,B Roberts,,"My worst travel experience ever. At security I was taking my laptop out of my bag (you only get to unpack right at the scanner) when an aggressive attendant grabbed all my belongings out of my hands and shoved the tray through the scanner. Stunned I walked through the scanner but another guard sent be back out rudely saying I cut in front of a family (I didn't). She made me stand just outside the scanner for quite a while like a naughty school kid publicly humiliated while other passengers walked past and looked at me. When she finally said I could go through she continued to berate me saying ""obviously you don't travel much!"". They then kept my bag behind the counter for a further ten minutes until I finally called their supervisor. Their tone changed immediately. They explained I had left my Ipad in my bag and I said ""Yes because you grabbed my things off me before I could finish!"". If you like public humiliation and an alarming sense of powerlessness go to Copenhagen! For me never again.",1,0
copenhagen-airport,Anders P Pedersen,Denmark,Friday afternoon 15/6-2012 just prior to peak holiday seasons: The airport was then very crowded and then it becomes cramped to move around with family and luggage it becomes hard and tedious to move fast anywhere though never directly stuck. With only 2 hours time available prior to departure we could not manage to get time for lounge visit as time was lost in packed areas though no queues took more than 15 minutes to overcome. The airport is fantastic as one almost always get direct gate access to flights and do not have to walk far anywhere – i.e. bus transport to a/c are not frequent. Secondly after check-in one gets easily to the 1st floor and from there no more ups and downs as all the rest happens in the same level.,8,1
copenhagen-airport,Barbara Rowe,United States,"Arrived in Copenhagen on June 7 (last week) and had no problems. The departure yesterday was a different story and results in my agreeing with other reviewers that this is the worst airport I have been to. The SAS staff will not provide boarding tickets to passengers - - they insist that all passengers use the self-help kiosks whether you are up to the challenge or not. Some of the kiosks were ""frozen"" or the scanner for passports was broken and covered with tape. My email from Orbitz did not provide the correct info for me to get a boarding pass. SAS staff directed me and a lot of other folks to a line for help from one of their colleagues to look up our info in their computer at which point they wrote a number on a slip of paper and sent us back to the kiosks. After that there were the lines for baggage check-in which have already been mentioned by other reviewers as uncontrolled and very chaotic. I found the staff to be ill-tempered. The security was the next process and while I did not find any problems with my granddaughter and I passing through we watched the man ahead of us being treated very disrespectfully by the security agent. Thinking we were finally through all the hurdles there was yet another queue on the way to the gate and many passengers were asking to jump ahead for fear of missing their flights. This line was for another look at our passports. Very stressful and tiring experience with little time left for shopping.",1,0
copenhagen-airport,S Bishop,United Kingdom,Departed from Copenhagen on afternoon of June 9th from T3. Have to say that we were absolutely disgusted by the total chaos in approaching the security gates. No one minds waiting to get through security as it is obviously essential to safe travel but in T3 it was like a massive rugby scrum and surely the antithesis of security! It started off well enough with a pleasant security officer guiding people into a queue but the queue then approached two information girls who directed people to left or right. On each side there were 6 or so belts but no system of queuing so that everyone was just piling towards the conveyor and security gate in a random fashion pushing and shoving trying to get to the gate. It was actually very unsafe and we were left like this for about 20 minutes whilst trying to get to the security gate. Also counter productive for the airport as when we did eventually get through we were in no mood to look at the shops and just went straight to the departure gate and waited there. In addition it seemed as if the airport staff were totally disinterested in what was happening. Definitely my worse airport experience.,2,0
copenhagen-airport,Anthony Biggar,Australia,Flew out of Copenhagen for flight home to Australia on Singapore Airlines. Was the worst out of the airports in Europe we had used (others being Amsterdam Frankfurt and Stockholm). Check-in was fine but was abused by airport staff at baggage check for not removing my wallet from my pants. Have not previously had to remove wallet at other airports. Only a two minute wait at baggage check but then about a 15 minute wait at immigration. Only had two booths open for non Danish citizens and a lot of people in the line were getting agitated that they might miss their plane and lots of queue jumping going on with people getting angry. Best tip for airport is to go through passport / immigration control early but once on other side only one shop. Overall not a very inviting airport.,3,0
copenhagen-airport,Anders Pedersen,Denmark,Airport a pleasure: easy to access. Easy to move around and find check-in counters. Not many queues anywhere on an Easter Sunday. Security: again no queue. Plenty of lounges (4-5) with ample space staff service minded and proactive. Precise information from monitors. Passport/immigration: again no waiting time. Gate: No waiting time to enter gate. Waiting time from gate to a/c: 5 minutes. Only announcements in gate areas – otherwise the airport is quiet and relaxing. Toilet facilities plenty and clean. No showers in any lounges (apart from the SAS-lounge). Shopping a bit intrusive as there is no way one can escape confrontation. On the other hand shopping staff were polite decent and knowledgeable.,9,1
copenhagen-airport,John Linden,Australia,"From a facility point of view it's a very good airport but staff could benefit from some basic training in how to provide service and be polite (or at least not to be rude and arrogant). Being an international airport it should be no surprise for staff including security staff that some customers do not understand Danish and that harshly repeating the same words in Danish may not get the message through. It may also be useful for all staff especially security staff to be aware of words and phrases like ""please"" ""thank you"" ""can I help you"" etc.",5,1
copenhagen-airport,L Nielsen,Denmark,A great airport for passengers light and open spaces but also pretty crowded. The biggest mistake of this airport is the central security that leads into the biggest tax-free shop which is the most expensive I have ever seen. Easy for transfer.,9,1
copenhagen-airport,T Utunen,Finland,Arriving (T3) and departing (T2) at CPH and found this airport very pleasant indeed: staff at all stations were friendly and co-operative very easy to navigate to and from the metro plus there are plenty of eating and shopping facilities in both terminals. Functional & friendly for visitors to wonderful Copenhagen.,9,1
copenhagen-airport,T Larson,Denmark,I think that this airport is getting worse and worse over the years. Passenger seats are completely absent. Probably because as other travellers mentioned they chose to transfer the airport into a shopping mall. Everything is extremely expensive and quality food in non existent. The worst experience ever is arriving at CPH. First of all on your way to the baggage belts you have to pass all the way through the shops. When you arrive at the baggage area you realize that only 2-3 belts are in operation each one serving multiple flights at the same time. Waiting times for picking the luggage are very long minimum 30 minutes. Staff is not that helpful and polite. Overall the service is of low quality.,3,0
copenhagen-airport,J Petersson,Sweden,As others have pointed out this airport has turned into a shopping mall with some airline gates. Everything is annoyingly designed to make you go in the shops from herding you from the security check through a giant tax- free shop almost without signage to the total lack of seating in the terminal itself. Airside areas are filthy shabby unwelcoming and with low ceilings. They have a lot of baggage belts at arrivals but usually just use a few of them with bags from several flights arriving on one belt resulting in chaos. Together with often long waiting times that is maybe also a method to make you go to the arrival shop. Also be prepared to walk to and from the gates. There are only a few moving walkways and they are - yes you guessed it only available in areas without shops.,2,0
copenhagen-airport,A Hashim,Malaysia,I checked in at Terminal 2 for my flight back to Kuala Lumpur via Amsterdam. It was a busy Sunday's afternoon. However I managed to get to the departure gate within 40 minutes after having my boarding card at the check-in counter. In general the airport staff were pretty helpful although they were not particularly friendly. Last but not least a few more seats at the departure area would definitely appreciated.,3,0
copenhagen-airport,Azlan Hashim,Malaysia,I arrived from Istanbul. The immigration staff were friendly and efficient. Luggage arrived on the belt within 15 minutes. The airport seems pretty crowded at certain periods. The metro service is the best transportation between the airport and the city centre.,4,0
copenhagen-airport,Hans Christian Iversen,United Kingdom,I went through the airport 4 times in the past week and what a disappointing experience. Gate B10 from Greenland always has problems with the walkway and we had to wait 40 mins to get off the plane. The baggage trolleys inside the airport are not cleared after 10pm so you can hardly leave the airport with all the blocked trolleys. The airport was generally dirty and not clean. Staff at security-check were rude and unhelpful and did not even help elderly people push their luggage on to the x-ray machine. Altogether a disappointing experience after having been through 4 times in a week. They really need to improve their performance.,2,0
copenhagen-airport,Henrik Schou Hansen,Nepal,What used to be an excellent airport has over the last couple of years been turned into a shopping mall. Copenhagen airport used to be known for its good taste and cosiness - now it is slowly turning into a nightmare. I will in the future chose Amsterdam or Frankfurt as my gateway to Europe.,2,0
copenhagen-airport,B Murphy,Sweden,Most things are fine in this airport except for one thing deciding to put the arrivals hall check-in hall and train station hall all on the same level and in the same place in Terminal 3. This leads to a rugby scrum on busy days with people walking in different directions all bumping into each other. Even when it's not busy it's a bit of an illogical mess.,4,0
copenhagen-airport,Steve Hedden,United States,A shopping centre with a few airline gates tacked on. On arriving from the USA I was forced to walk the entire length of the duty free area to get to my connecting gate. On my return I had to wait in the corridor outside the gate seating area until my flight was ready to board then my boarding pass taken to enter the seating area and once everyone was in the seating area from the corridor the plane boarded. Very inefficient. On the positive side security and customs were a breeze and every worker I encountered was pleasant.,3,0
copenhagen-airport,Derek Leask,United Kingdom,This has to be the most expensive airport anywhere so make sure you are prepared if you face any length of transit time. Drinks of course are expensive a beer is over 5 Euros for example. Food and drink is nothing to write home about and all restaurants are open plan so there is no quiet areas to relax in. Shopping is usual variety but mostly designer shops selling expensive clothes with the airport premium added on. There is no free internet service or anything customer friendly like that. No this is just a big impersonal expensive airport.,2,0
copenhagen-airport,Gary Colburn,United Kingdom,Manchester-Copenhagen return. Kastrup is an impressive airport clean modern easy to navigate and staffed by polite and informative staff. Expensive shops however this is to be expected at a Scandinavian airport quality is decent though.,4,0
copenhagen-airport,Lukas Agerskov,Denmark,Copenhagen is a great international airport. The service is often great a little busy as all international airports but the staff is friendly and copes with the problem as good as they can. The look of the airport is fantastic. Its sophisticated it has style and is easy to navigate. The time it takes from check-in to the transit hall doesn't take more than maximum 15 minutes with the new security system and the big windows in the transit lounge makes the mood great for flying. One og the downsides is the extremely expensive shops but one doesn't Have to buy anything walking around looking is good enough. The other and biggest downside is the distance between the terminals. Terminal 1 is very far from terminal 2 and 3. There is an airport bus every 10 minutes but not all travelers know this and can therefore experience a rather long walk.,5,0
copenhagen-airport,Alastair Finch,United Kingdom,Didn't have a problem here large clean airport with long walking distances but check in and security very smooth. Facilities very good am surprised at other negative comments.,4,0
copenhagen-airport,M Larsen,Denmark,I travel a lot and my trips always start in Copenhgen Airport. I think that its a excellent airport with superb lounges and shopping possibilities and all in all a great place to wait for your flight it is the all time best airport I've been to.,5,0
copenhagen-airport,Dean Forbes,United Kingdom,Arriving in Copenhagen is always a pleasure. It is quiet and relaxed and at the same time efficient and clean. In almost two decades of regular flying I have never experienced long queues except for the extended security performed by some US airlines when checking in and at GRU which probably explains why they have the monopoly there. Airport buses are available near terminal 1 and are easy to find and pay for even if you don't speak the lingo.,3,0
copenhagen-airport,A Pedersen,Vietnam,Easy small modern airport for transfers as well as for final or entry point. Simplicity and short distances make the airport a pleasant experience. Oppose strongly the shopping malls which one is forced (trapped?) to walk through when moving around.,4,0
copenhagen-airport,Peter Hutchinson,Australia,Transitted through CPH and only complaint is that airline lounges are not airside. Had to enter Denmark to get access to Star Alliance Gold Lounge. SAS ground staff very efficient in providing taxi / hotel vouchers for an overnight stay due to aircraft unavailability.,4,0
copenhagen-airport,Phyllis Rizzi,United States,"I was surprised at the inefficiency at this airport. The counter agent ""forgot"" to tag my bag and because of confusion with the conveyor belt not operating properly I didn't notice. It took 3 days to receive my bag in the US. The airport is attractive but the walk from the bus arrival area to the International terminal is horrible - especially in the rain. There are no moving walkways to the gates - a very long distance for physically challenged and people with small children. The security check is the worst I've ever encountered - carryon bags were dumped out contents removed and refused (a can of fish) and I was patted down without benefit of a choice of a female agent (I am female). A second security check at the gate area resulted in the plane leaving late because the checking agency (US) could not connect and verify many passenger IDs. I will avoid this airport at all costs even if I have to pay more to fly through another location",2,0
copenhagen-airport,C Recalcati,Italy,Very good airport. We arrived with delay from Milan and had to take another flight in only 30 minutes: everything ok also with the baggage. Boarding without any problem.,4,0
copenhagen-airport,A Gustafsson,Sweden,I use the airport approx 2 times weekly for a mixture of domestic european and intercontinental flights. I find it efficient pleasant clean and very easy to navigate. It's also a plus that transport to and from Copenhagen city is fast comfortable and reliable.,5,0
copenhagen-airport,R Ambord,Switzerland,Used this airport the first time to start a cruise from Copenhagen. Very good place with a big shopping arcade. We were disappointed when we left Copenhagen we could not see a fast line for business tickets.,4,0
copenhagen-airport,L Ralte,India,Flew into Copenhagen Kastrup from Vienna by Tyrolean. The signs were clear a long walk past all the duty free shops to get to the baggage claim. The counter for buying tickets for onward journey to Malmo could be a bit confusing for first timer. Flying out from Kastrup is another story - not very friendly.,5,0
copenhagen-airport,Paul Van Alsten,France,Arriving at pier A resulted in quite a lengthy walk to the exit area. Had carry-on luggage only but noticed very long waiting times for baggage reclaim. Railway station located just after exit. Ticket kiosks easy to use but check that you use the correct machine - DSB kiosks sell tickets for all Danish destinations grey SJ machines are mostly for long-distance cities in Sweden red or violet Skanetrafiken machines sell tickets for Southern Sweden. Transfer to the Swedish city of Malmo is convenient - modern regional trains shuttle over the Oresund bridge every 20 mins. Travel time is around 25 mins and costs 105SEK one-way. Departing CPH is a mixed experience. Self-service machines did not work properly so had to lose half an hour as only two check-in desks were open. Flying back on Saturday evening meant no waiting at security. However staff there very unfriendly not to say downright rude - no words spoken only some vague gestures. Airside the terminal resembles a large shopping mall. Catering facilities overpriced but of good quality - spent around 150DKK for an orange juice and three fresh open-faced sandwiches. Toilets moderately clean and always located in some hidden corners.,3,0
copenhagen-airport,F Ganbich,Denmark,Getting increasingly disappointed with arriving at CPH airport. With my 12 arrivals in the past 6 weeks there were only 2 occasions where I waiting for my luggage for less than 30 minutes the screen information giving incorrect information. on 2 occasions information on the luggage arrivals belt even 'disappeared' from the screens. Whenever I enquired with the not always very airport staff unexpected snowfall was the univocal explanation. It's winter and this is Scandinavia! I can only attribute these 'unexpected snowfall' explanations to excuses for providing inferior and lazy service standards.,2,0
copenhagen-airport,A Guildal,Denmark,I have used Copenhagen Airport hundreds of times and this airport has never disappointed. The design of Terminal 3 bright light spacious modern and yet cosy. The walk to/from gates can be a little long though. Staff is friendly and attentive and the transfer possibilities and facilities are excellent.,5,0
copenhagen-airport,G Cleaver,United Kingdom,Used Copenhagen for flight from Moscow to London via this airport. A very quiet airport. Food is quite a rip off though and not a lot of facilities.,4,0
copenhagen-airport,K Pardoe,Australia,All flights T3. Arrived from Narita and straight into a full security check which seemed bizarre. Transferring on SAS to Manchester. No seating outside departure lounge so bodies sitting/lying in the corridors. Flight display outside gate not working so fingers crossed no change to gate prior to flight. Quite a bit of renovations going on nice wooden floors going in hopefully some seating too. 3 weeks later arrived from Heathrow landed at 1700 caught the 1736 train to Malmo after clearing immigration and baggage control.,3,0
copenhagen-airport,Carsten Marquart,,It was horrible to travel out of Copenhagen Saturday 20. of June 2009 due to low manning and/or low capacity to handle the amount of passengers. Arriving at the airport more than 1 hour and 20 minutes prior to the scheduled flight-time of the plane to London should be sufficient enough. First the automatic check-in facilities did not recognize my reservation number even though there had been no changes in the reservation since the purchase 10 days prior. I and a handfull of other passengers were sent to a line for passengers with problems using the check-in machines. This line was handled by one person only and 25 minutes prior to departure after being in line for 40 minutes we finally convinced an employee to check us in separately and bypass the line. We were met by another big line at the security control but just managed to get on the airplane by running through the entire terminal. The staff appeared to be in a bad mood no wonder and one member even critizised us for arriving at the airport too late. When I arrived in North America 18 hours later the local baggage service informed me that my suitcase had not left Copenhagen Airport yet. Rail transportation to the airport works excellent though. I would like to have reviewed other aspects of the airport but I did not have the time to notice that.,2,0
copenhagen-airport,M Golding,,Pleasant experience in Copenhagen airport. Transport links to the centre of the city are excellent. On arrival we took the Metro from the airport to Norreport metro station - took about 10 mins. Check in on the way home (Sun mid afternoon) was very quick - done via one of the automatic machines which even print your luggage tag - no queue at bag drop. Only problem was at security - very long queues and despite videos showing you what you need to do (take off belts etc) people were still waiting until they got to the security check before taking off jackets/ putting liquids in bags etc. Once through security nice airy terminal and plenty of shops.,4,0
copenhagen-airport,Claus Nielsen,,Some things work really well in CPH others don't. The walking distance from domestic to international is killing. The staff is usually OK but not as friendly and relaxed as in Billund. The lounges I've tried are not worth bragging about - Novia is small crammed has obnoxious staff and little food/drink selection. Servisair is better more roomy and offers separate smoking room and massage chairs. The atmosphere is a bit gloomy though. I expect the SAS lounge to be much better but I haven't been there for years as they don't accept Priority Pass. On the good side the shopping options are very good and unlike most other airports you actually don't get ripped off. If the sign says Sale then you actually are saving substantially compared to normal prices. Restaurants are high class and there's plenty to choose from. And the general design of the airport is modern lightyears better than Arlanda in Stockholm similar to Gardermoen in Oslo but not quite as nice as Billund.,3,0
copenhagen-airport,J Bailey,,Only ever transferred here and it is good in that respect. It is quite big but roomy and with quite a lot of options to wile away one or two hours. I do not know what it is like outside but it is a good transfer location.,4,0
copenhagen-airport,Henrik Vad,,Copenhagen Airport has turned into a shopping centre and has become very poor. So if you want a smooth check-in security control pass immigrations luggage handling by arrival fair prices for parking etc. then avoid Copenhagen Airport! If you live in Denmark or Sweden then don't pay the horrible fees for parking. Public transport to Copenhagen or Malmo/Sweden by rail is fast cheap and comfortable. Check-in be prepared for long lines and crowding - especially if you are travelling economy. Security control long lines and crowding. The security control is absolutely not efficient compared with other airports. E.g. why haven't they established a conveyor belt or tables along the lines so you are able to prepare your jacket belt mobile laptop etc. for scanning while waiting? After the security control don't expect to find information and which gate the flight leaves from. Instead be prepared to disappear in a crowded shopping centre. This is very stressing and you have a very high risk for missing your flight because you can't estimate walking time. And be aware - the prices in the airport is not competitive with shops in Copenhagen. There is not very much public space in the airport (because of all the shops) so be prepared for a long and crowded walking distance to the gate. When arriving to Copenhagen Airport be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes for the luggage handling. Also be prepared for long lines in immigrations.,1,0
copenhagen-airport,U Ekernas,,CPH has at long last regulated smoking thus removing what was always its biggest drawback: the need to walk through great clouds of tobacco smoke just to get to the gate. It's elegant and clean with extensive shopping facilities and the distances between gates are no worse than at comparable airports. The airport police was very helpful and friendly when my wife misplaced her purse. Note however that I almost always use CPH as a transfer point rather than an origin/destination airport so I can't really comment on the landside end of things.,4,0
copenhagen-airport,Stefano Nicolai,,I used CPH four times this month and it's hard to find a better airport in Europe. Rapid check-in kind staff and a great deal of shopping facilities! Security procedures are smooth and almost no wait for your luggage. Metro and DSB trains connect CPH with central Copenhagen in less than 15 minutes (there are trains every few minutes). The only complaint could be about the long distances between gates.,5,0
copenhagen-airport,Yevheniy Kahanovych,,Mixed feelings. Bright and very nice design. Long walks (too long I would say). Fells overcrowded. Very convenient check-in machines where you can get boarding pass for virtually any airline. Great transport links to the city and to Malmo. Confusing layout of airside zone. After Heathrow 5 or Hong Kong it lacks clear straight direction from A to B. Going from check in to gate and using signs I made 2 circles and 1 U-turn. Not easy. All in all good facility very clean with helpful staff. 4 star.,4,0
copenhagen-airport,M Muller,,The Airport is clean transport from the city smooth by train but ways are very long and it seems like the airport was probably built with a lot of over-capacity. Still it lacks of check-in- facilities and queuing is even required for business. And what is that policy about having to check in hard-shell suitcases as odd sized luggage? (Which led to the not-arrival of my suitcase at Destination) I have never experienced that in any other airport around the world.,3,0
copenhagen-airport,K Allerton,,This airport has everything its Scandinavian counterparts lack. Extremely nice design unlike Stockholm and extremely good shopping centre and food unlike Oslo. I had the best seafood in years cannot imagine a better airport to spend a few hours.

copenhagen-airport,Kevin Halouska,,Despite arriving at a semi-empty airport we had to be bussed to the terminal rather than use the finger which we had pulled right up to. Always annoying. Public transport to Copenhagen by rail is fast cheap and comfortable. First class! Departing Copenhagen one noticed that there was a lot of building work going on. There were too many shops crowding in on public areas as well which makes it look more and more like a UK airport which is not a good sign. Finally many passengers nearly missed their flights to various UK destinations since there was one immigration officer at the piers passport control. I have never seen such long lines in an EU airport. It felt as though I was trying to leave the old Soviet Union.,3,0
copenhagen-airport,P Elliff,,The airport was very unimpressive - very long walks to get from where you are to where you want to be and confusing to get around. The worst part is that I am a non smoker and it is VERY difficult to find smoke-less air when walking around or waiting for your luggage (there was a table with an umbrella under which smokers needed to stand and smoke - but nothing to draw the smoke away from coming right into the luggage area room). We had a long walk from arrival to get to the main area - and these little smoker areas were in the narrow hallways all the way through-out - could not escape the smoke. The shopping area is very nice - but when getting out of the area the smoke hits you again. The restaurant area is quite smoky - hard to find a place to sit where one can breathe without smoke.,2,0
copenhagen-airport,Ben Ward,,The terminal was busy but staff were friendly. I was impressed with the security screening how fast and efficient it was. There is a good selection of shops bars and cafes and places to sit.,5,0
copenhagen-airport,Ros Denney,,I would like to add to the previous comment about signage at CPH. As soon as you have been screened at security the departure gate screens are ahead of you. I will agree that more screens are needed. In terms of gate status - that is usually down to the gate agent. Especially low cost carriers like EasyJet don´t have their gates announced until 30 40 mins before departure. Which is understandable as they have typically very short 25 min turnarounds. I like the new direct metro link which is a huge time saver and has made this Airport extremely accessible. The self service check in at the metro platform is a nice touch. The only thing that let´s it down is the lack of escalators from Metro station down to Check in and arrival level. There are elevators but even so this was a design error in my opinion. With all the new enhancements I would have hoped that they would have installed moving walkways between pier A and security/baggage claim. It´s a very long treck now. Otherwise this airport is still a firm favourite of mine.,5,0
copenhagen-airport,Hanne Jensen,,The signage has become very poor after the airport was turned into a shopping centre with a possibility to fly - if you can find a FIDS screen telling which gate you have to go to! I normally want to perform check-in pass immigrations and security control find which gate the flight leaves from (in order to estimate walking time) before I relax do some shopping have a cup of coffee etc. But in Copenhagen you are led into a shopping centre first - and not until you have passed that can you find information - that is: If it does show the gate at all. I had to wait until 40 minutes before departure before the gate was shown - and then with the note: Go to gate!,2,0
copenhagen-airport,Dave Kusiak,,I live in Sweden but I prefer to fly from CPH. Fabulous seafood in the one of the most famous seafood restaurant. Upper class airport great and fast service almost no queues. Check in to USA flights - maximum 10 min. European flights - you can use a lot of check in kiosks - really good and fast. Shopping a paradise for frequent airport shoppers.,5,0
copenhagen-airport,Matt Ray,,I love this airport. We have been stuck on big delays here on a few different trips and dare I say it was an absolute pleasure. There is actually some amazing dining here I had one of my favorite meals of our trip in their lovely airy seafood restaurant. Great shopping wonderful open design. Really great. One of my favorites in the world.,5,0
copenhagen-airport,Evelyn Nyström,,This is clearly my favourite airport in Europe! Cozy and beautiful at the same time. It's got everything you need and is the only airport I would voluntarily get stuck in waiting!,5,0
copenhagen-airport,Terry Stokes,,Clean and modern just poorly designed. Depending on the gate you arrive at or depart from you may be in for a long walk. A good range of shops and restaurants in airside but very little around the check-ins. Excellent public transport connections to Kopenhagen and Malmo (Sweden),4,0
corfu-airport,A Congdon,United Kingdom,"The ladies toilets were in a dreadful state. Only one had toilet paper and only 3 were in use. The door locks were also broken. There were rags on the floor and the bins with used toilet paper had no lids. There was only one facility offering hot food and drink. The coffee which was weak and insipid, came from a large urn. It tasted as if it had been made with sour milk and totally undrinkable. There were no tables to sit and eat at. Items for sale were overpriced and unappetising - mainly tired looking savoury pasties. There was no fresh fruit or salad or bread. The shops and duty free were fine and there was a good selection of reasonably priced Greek traditional food and alcoholic drinks. Also there was plenty of seating albeit metal chairs.",2,0
corfu-airport,Dan Graham,United Kingdom,"Without doubt the worst airport I have used.  Firstly upon arrival the check in desks were not opened on time followed by a poor system of having to then queue again to place your luggage through an X-ray machine. Stupid idea that causes more havoc when initially checking in. Once through to the departure lounge things do not get any better. You are immediately hit by the heat through poor to no air conditioning, making waiting for your flight very uncomfortable. A poor selection of newspapers and refreshments make the whole experience very disappointing. Toilets are diabolical and had so many out of order. On a plus point the wifi was good as I pen this review.",1,0
corfu-airport,Armin Schubert,Germany,I cannot believe that this is an airport in Europe. Very unfriendly check in staff. Officials show no interest in security. Food and beverage  offering is non existant and dirty. Looks like this airport was never renovated nor cleaned since its opening.,1,0
corfu-airport,C Wilson,United Kingdom,"On arrival I was very pleased with how quickly we got through passport control and got our cases. Our departure was a different case altogether. We arrived in plenty of time (3 hours before take-off) and we then joined a queue to check in our luggage. We were 6th in the queue and it took us 45 minutes to get checked in, then we moved to another queue to put our cases through and then another queue to go through security. In total it took us 1 hour 35 mins to get through to the departure lounge. Then we had to check in at the gate. Not sure why as we then had to sit down for another hour. I thought (maybe) that we would then get through the departure gate quicker but no we had to queue again and check in again before going through. Not sure of the purpose of the double check-in? The toilets were disgusting. I asked if there were any cleaner toilets but sadly these were the only ones in the departure area. Out of 8 cubicles 3 were broken. So dissapointed after a great holiday in Corfu that the airport has really let it down.",1,0
corfu-airport,Richard Hodges,United Kingdom,"Travelled into Corfu in 2014 to find in hadn't moved on since I last flew in in 1976. Not fit for purpose. Travelled in again this year (15 June) and out again 22nd June. At least this year got our bags very quickly when arriving so scarpered nice and quickly. And when departing check in (Jet2.com desks) was relatively quick and painless. Unfortunately for others they had, once again, to queue outside for ages in strong hot sunshine before even getting to the check in desks. Crawled through security and then into the simply awful departure 'lounge'. This airport is sadly still not fit for purpose, and with things being what they are economically won't change any time soon.",1,0
corfu-airport,J Mortensen,Denmark,worst airport I've been to they have far too many passengers for the capacity of the airport the security queue is at the same location as the check-in counters and as there is only two security scanners at the airport the security queue gets so big that it is almost impossible just to get to the queue for the check-in counters. The check in counters have a weird system where you have to take your bag to another location at the airport to get it checked when you have checked in at the counter it would surprise me if everybody in the security queue were able to catch their flight in time as it was so slow that it almost took all the 2 hours that you got from check-in counters opening to the flight leaving just to get through the security queue.,,0
corfu-airport,Richard Hodges,United Kingdom,EMA-Corfu-EMA 2 June out and 9 June return. I hadn't used Corfu Airport since my last visit some 35 years ago but things do not appear to have improved! Typical Greek Airport - lots of flights on the same day (and probably all crammed into the same hour). There are now two luggage belts but the TV screens telling you which belt is for your flight are almost unreadable as you have to look directly into the sun to see them. Chaos reigns when you come to depart - queuing outside in the sun for an hour or so absolutely rammed through security into the departure lounge as all the flights now depart at or about the same time! This was an early June Monday morning - nowhere near the peak season - and the airport isn't really fit for purpose. Facilities once through security are minimal and there are just not enough seating areas. I suppose one of the charms of the Greek Islands is the laid back thing - but with their airports much patience is required just think of a cold beer and a nice Greek salad.,2,0
corfu-airport,L Cadwallader,United Kingdom,Into and out of Corfu on late night flights before the main season started so we had no problems with crowds or queuing. Travelling with hand luggage only made things even easier. Passport control in either direction was very casual to say the least but security on departure seemed reasonably thorough without causing any serious holdups. We only bought a bottle of water airside as we know buying anything at Corfu airport can be expensive. Only one agent to handle boarding for our flight but she got us through the gate swiftly and efficiently. All in all this passage through CFU was almost a breeze compared with our last two trips when we experienced long delays before departure.,7,1
corfu-airport,G Bathu,United Kingdom,Flew out of here to Gatwick. Overall airport is not great and having had to drop our car off early and then a four hour wait meant we ended up using the airport cafe and snack bar. All I can say is what an absolute rip-off - 7 Euros for a coke and a peppermint tea 3.60 Euros for an ice cream lollipop. The food was equally expensive and tasteless. It might be slightly less galling if the surroundings were pleasant but they aren't - no air conditioning and dirty tables. Corfu is a lovely place but the airport really lets it down.,3,0
corfu-airport,L Dev,United Kingdom,Average holiday airport really facilities are nothing amazing just one shop for sandwiches pastries etc and the usual Duty Free but for a small Mediterranean airport you can't really expect a state-of-the-art shopping complex so I've got nothing to complain about there really. However my biggest complaint is yes you guessed it the queues outside. I understand that when I flew out it was the busiest day for UK flights with constant movement on the tarmac but it was hardly the first busy holiday airport I'd ever been to and I'd never experienced that before. The check-in area was hardly rammed when we finally got in so I don't understand that one. And after we'd been to the check-in desk and had our bags weighed we had to then lug our baggage to the end of the row of check in desks to actually put our bags through. Again that was new to me. Apart from that queues weren't too bad and I didn't feel like the terminal was overcrowded although it was very busy with loads of people going home to Manchester Gatwick Newcastle Leeds Glasgow Cardiff etc etc.,4,0
corfu-airport,T Plane,United Kingdom,Don't book with Thomson as you have to queue for hours outside the airport if you fly with them whilst other companies passengers just sail through. Its chaos. Thomson reps are rude and speak to their customers badly. You are nothing better than cattle to them! Once actually allowed inside the building you queue to check in then and then there is a huge queue for security and people with suitcases who take them on board as hand luggage just hold up the system as they have don't appear to be able to read! It is a requirement that you have to get out electrical appliances from hand luggage etc to go through security but it doesn't seem to matter how long these customers queue for they simply don't think the rules apply to them and then hold up the queue whilst they make space for themselves to sort out their items at the last minute! Its chaos.,1,0
corfu-airport,Renny Vol,United Kingdom,Avoid if you can. We just returned from there 2 days ago. Unfriendly rude staff. Chaos everywhere. A huge queue to pass security and passport control. Once you finally pass it you find crowds of people from about 15 different flights all cramped in a small waiting room and there are only 5 departure gates. My boyfriend and myself wanted to sit next to each other in the waiting area as our flight was in 2 hours. We couldn't find 2 seats next to each other. Children were crying. People pushing each other as there is enough space to even walk around. Only one coffee shop to buy something to drink. Forget if you are hungry. One type of a small sandwich (5 euros!) and it wasn't fresh. Over priced shops.,1,0
corfu-airport,Derek Coster,United Kingdom,Pretty poor airport but it does the important things ok. Food and drink wise there is a cafe/bar landside and some sort of Taverna outside but all you have airside is a smallish outlet serving sandwiches/pies and drinks (if you're lucky) and unbelievably doesn't accept cards of any type. Worse than that there is no allocated seating beyond a few small stands. Just to round things off the staff were rude and miserable. There is no cash machine airside nor is there a drinking fountain should you get thirsty and have no Euros. On top of that you are packed in with far too many people for the seating available. There are a couple of duty free shops. Thankfully there is air conditioning or it would be pretty unbearable. If you are a smoker then get your fix before you go through security if you have a long wait for your flight as there is no smoking anywhere. Note take no notice of your holiday rep telling you to queue outside. It'll be boiling hot and there is nothing to stop you waiting in the air conditioned terminal or going to the cafe upstairs. A pretty poor show for such a busy (at least in season) airport. Corfu is not some small little island that only sees a flight a day and it should have an airport that is appropriate to modern needs. Having said that Greece is really going through it at the moment so nothing much is going to change anytime soon. It won't bother me though I'm not going back to Corfu again. It's a tatty old place these days and there are far better places to spend your holidays.,4,0
corfu-airport,L Craig,United Kingdom,Really rude staff made to pay for excess baggage 180 euros even though we had group booking and did not have to pay on the way out. Our Thomas Cook rep said it was okay to weigh all cases together once at airport but staff made me pay for my bag individually. Will not travel to this airport again.,,0
corfu-airport,A Burden,United Kingdom,Airport a shambles we had to stand outside in a queue for about an hour with our 8 year old grandson in the midday heat then in a queue to check in then a long queue for passport control - in total about 2 hours. When finally in departures had time just to get some water before boarding. Lovely island but won't be back because of airport need to be at least twice the size for volume of people.,,0
corfu-airport,O S Mullins,United Kingdom,We arrived in Corfu from London Gatwick with Tor Air as soon as we arrived we disembarked onto a nice air conditioned bus which carted us to the terminal. On entry to the terminal the ground staff were friendly asking if we needed assistance. Everything fine in Arrivals picked bags up which was a 10 minute wait from Aircraft to carousel. Went to the rental car kiosks no problems. On the way back check in was swift and pleasant security clearance was a breeze oh and the Aircraft was early and we boarded and left early. All in all couldn't fault Corfu Airport and wouldn't hesitate to recommend.,10,1
corfu-airport,P Potter,United Kingdom,Horrible airport surly staff. We queued for hour and half in the sun just to get inside. When we did I was subjected to an aggressive body search (I am a 56 year old woman) and told to empty my hand luggage. I refused had had enough of their treatment and told them so. I was allowed through.,2,0
corfu-airport,M Cox,United Kingdom,Just returned from a cruise of the Greek islands with our flight back from Corfu airport. Again we had to queue outside in midday heat to get inside taxi drivers were on strike and all walking about the main stretch. Inside we stood in a queue to have our cases weighed very surly staff with no greeting. I had an excess baggage charge which shocked me I was told I could not have my boarding card and sent to an empty booth for 20 mins until a woman told me I owed 48 Euro for my baggage slapped the change down and walked off. Once through and heading to our gate boarding cards were torn off without a smile or even looking at the passengers while talking to another staff member. It left a bad taste in our mouth we shall avoid this airport from now on.,1,0
corfu-airport,Peter Ireland,United Kingdom,Just returned from Paleokastritsa - in 1971 the terminal building was merely a small villa type dwelling where you passed through customs and they crossed your case with chalk I understand the building is still there. No hassle or queuing in those days and then off in an awaiting taxi to the destination. May 2011 we find hoards of people congregating outside the terminal. Once inside the arrivals/departure hall was far too small. Large numbers of people with children had to wait outside the main departure hall in temperatures of 30+C. Once inside the departure hall it was chaos. People checking in were mixing with people waiting to enter Passport Control and you just could not find the end of the line you needed to get into. Airline reps were ushering people in all different directions and at one stage we came to a halt because people outside were given priority to go through Passport Control as a last call for their flight to Manchester was announced over the intercom system it was an utter shambles. Anyway after an hour and a half we finally managed to get into the departure lounge exhausted but thankful we allowed sufficient time to check in. For a holiday destination where some areas of the island were not officially open until June we were amazed at the number of people departing on one day.,1,0
corfu-airport,Jerry Sutton,United Kingdom,The arrivals/departure hall was obviously far too small for the volume of traffic. Large numbers of people had to wait in line outside the main departure hall in temperatures of 38C. Once inside found the departure hall to be total chaos. The staff points were rude and unhelpful even snatching the passports and tickets from our hands in an aggressive manner. The prices for food etc were a joke with the staff adopting a couldn't care less attitude. I will never book a holiday via this airport again - without doubt the worst we have used.,1,0
corfu-airport,Brian Hill,,There are good and bad points for CFU. The major change is the attitude of the staff - obviously the Greek economic crisis has made the staff worried about their jobs but they are not winning friends with a 'why are you coming to our airport' attitude . Still have to queue outside but the Thomson Airways staff did their best to minimise the hassle.,2,0
corfu-airport,L Cadwallader,,"Plenty of time to study Corfu Airport as we had a 6 hour delay for the return flight courtesy of easyJet. In some respects it has improved in the intervening period eg. more space in the departure lounge but in others it remains the same eg. rip-off prices for refreshments. Arrival was easy particularly since we were on hand luggage only and there were few other flights at that time. Departure seemed smooth enough too until the delay became apparent. We acted on the advice of previous correspondents and entered through Arrivals but in any case the check-in area was not too crowded. Seeing that the departure lounge had plenty of empty seats we went swiftly to security (short queues) and were through quite quickly. Our online paper boarding ""cards"" did seem to be a cause of some surprise though. We were quite impressed by the security staff who were both pleasant and efficient. I forgot to extract my liquids bag from my hand luggage: it was spotted on the scanner I was asked politely to open my bag and after the contents were inspected I was thanked. On our second passage through having had to go back to the landside restaurant for our free ""light refreshments"" the pencils my wife invariably carries in the top of her socks were spotted and investigated: no one else has ever noticed them on any of our trips abroad. The departure lounge did become crowded at times announcements were hard to hear - partly because of the combined noise of several hundred people but also because of the speed at which many of them were made - and the screens were less than informative or up-to-date. There seemed to be long queues at the food counter and if the prices we saw as we had our free refreshments in the restaurant were any indication the airport must be making a mint (each free pie + bottle of water would have cost 5 euros with a 1.50 euro cover charge on top). Predictably enough our spare unopened bottle of water handed out in the restaurant upstairs then had to be surrendered at security downstairs but the security lady was charming about it. When we returned to the departure lounge after our refreshments it was much quieter and there was room to spread out for the rest of our wait though the metal seats are scarcely comfortable. Also why are they in threes when so many passengers are in couples? Overall a mixture of pluses and minuses but I would give it 3 stars rather than 2 because of the surprisingly positive impression we gained of the security staff.",3,0
corfu-airport,R Taylor,,For a busy holiday airport this has the worst departure lounge facilities we have experienced! If you are in need of refreshment as we were there is no cafe just a long queue to a buffet counter where you are ripped off! We had to pay over 15 Euro for two small lukewarm barely drinkable coffees a miniscule tooth breaking baguette and a soft drink. This was virtually thrown at us by two disinterested girls who probably would not understand the meaning of common courtesy or customer satisfaction. Only a couple of the monitors mounted from the ceiling were working - others broken or switched off and nothing like enough of the hard metal seats to accommodate the crowd of people who were waiting for flights when we were there. Toilet facilities are very poor which I would not like to elaborate on! I pity anyone who has to spend any length of time in this confined area.,2,0
corfu-airport,Brian Hill,,I agree with the comments by Phil McVey (12 August 2008); inbound the ground staff had great difficulties unloading the luggage containers from the A300 hence a wait of about 40 minutes and yes the tour reps are a menace but a fully laden trolley (if you find one) is a suitable weapon. Departing follow Phil's suggestion we got to the airport about 30 minutes before check in was scheduled to open were marshalled by a very helpful Monarch rep and checked in a few minutes. The departure area is small and there would not be enough seats if it was busy it is bright and cool. I've been to far worse airports - Gatwick springs to mind.,4,0
corfu-airport,Phil McVey,,Airport very busy but found arriving by hire car just as check in opened meant there were no queues. Check in took 5 mins stayed in upstairs cafe until 40 mins before departure time and walked straight through departures onto bus for aircraft. Plenty of staff around all went well and seemed well organised. Main issue is as others have said tour reps blocking the areas. All in all though a much better experience than expected.,4,0
corfu-airport,Terry Butcher,,Agree with Sue Nicholas's comments re independent travellers and problems with tour reps. Here's what I have done last 5 years returning from golf holiday. Presume you are arriving by car or taxi. Time it so you arrive just about start of your check in. Don't drop off or go direct to departures from the road but go inside via the arrivals section and walk through to departure thus bypassing all the reps and crowds outside. Normally at most airports arrival and departure are separated but not at Corfu.,3,0
corfu-airport,Peter Garvey,,My wife and I have experienced Corfu airport on more than one occasion and although it seems small for the amount of passengers it handles I can honestly say that no real problems have as yet been encountered. We were once delayed upon departure for four hours (nothing to do with security checks and queues elsewhere) while a problem with our outbound flight was resolved. The aircraft was a B767-300 for anyone interested. Because of this they allowed us outside where a huge amount of chairs had been arranged under canvas to keep the hot sun off (30 degrees). This reduced congestion inside the building. We went back in with an hour to go and eventually departed Corfu. Great flight good crew and no complaints worthy of note. Problems happen with aircraft and I'm always happy to wait for the right people to fix them!,3,0
corfu-airport,Michael Sitch,,Having been a frequent visitor to the island over the past ten years I can confirm that the airport has gone from unorganised chaos to organised chaos! It is fair to say that the staff and management at the airport have done a lot to get their act together but still seem to do things the greek way and to greek time. The new system of checking into receive boarding passes and then taking your cases to the end of the check in desk for scanning does seem to be speeding up the queues but i still have to ask why they have to make this a separate procedure? On my visit in July the new check in system worked so well that the queue for passport control was now snaking twice round all the way back out of the terminal and back in and up to the one security guard checking passports. Two Guards would have made this easier and faster but then how would the hand baggage scanners keep up? The Airport have to build in delays somewhere along the chain and make passengers queue somewhere along the line otherwise they just would not cope with the demand and the whole process would just collapse! The Airport does not help matters when it herds all non domestic passengers through one end of the terminal leaving the other end of the terminal that is used for internal flights empty. They could also scan luggage once it has been checked in. As for the tour operators? I know most seem to work to a Monday/Friday system but i think some also go on Tuesdays. We have to share the airport with other tour operators from other countries like Germany and the airport has allocated other days of the week to them otherwise it would never cope. I think the thing that frustrates us all is why three or four planes from the UK arrive within the hour and snarl up the arrivals system? The baggage reclaim hall is tiny with only two carousels. Everyone is also too impatient when arriving into the hall to reclaim their baggage! When you arrive in the hall just relax and take your time! Use the toilet find a trolley or make contact with your holiday rep in arrivals or collect your hire car. Corfu is not like our airports and you can wander freely into the arrivals hall at any time to sort out what you need to. It always amuses to see a plane load of passengers jostling for position at the carousel and then waiting half an hour for the belt to spring into life. The Greeks do not rush and they certainly don't worry about a hall full of impatient passengers!,4,0
corfu-airport,Matthew Hisbent,,The previous comments are all spot on - but on rare days it can work like a dream. Returned from Aghios Gordios Friday Aug 10th at 11 pm for a 01:00am flight to East Midlands. Disembarked the minibus at 23:45 check in desk open luggage straight into scanners and through passport control by midnight and on the plane around 00:30 ready for take-off. Meanwhile passengers for other destinations were queuing as described though I spotted that new sheltered seating had been provided outside since I was last there. I dread to think what it could have been like had the visitor numbers not been so visibly down since my last visit. The local taverna owners all commented on it. I've come to expect to be patient waiting for luggage on the way into Corfu but much worse are the queues for departures when you're tired and a bit fed up at the thought of going home at all! The worst part of the trip was the flight home on the most uncomfortable plane I've ever been in. Corfu Airport is a lovely little airport and I have to agree it surely would work so much better if the holiday companies managed their collection of travellers from resorts with more regard for the airport's handling facilities and staggered their arrivals and departures better through the week.,4,0
corfu-airport,Sue Nicholas,,As an independent traveller I am amazed that company reps seem to have so much control or imply they have control over who waits in and outside the terminal building for flights. The tour companies must take responsibility for their own customers and not interfere with independent travellers. Half of the congestion is caused by the tour operators collecting customers for a number of flights on the same coach meaning many are arriving at the airport well in advance of their required check in time! I travel to Corfu at least twice a year and have done so for the past 10 yrs. The tour operators are causing most of the problems by bringing flights in on basically two transfer days. It has got worse not better over time. What they need to remember is that passengers are their clients and it is they who should be calling the tune not the other way round and certainly passengers should not be herded around like sheep when they pay such prices for their holidays!! The airport and its staff are wonderful. It is clean and tidy everyone is friendly. Scanners were better this May than they have been in the past. Tour companies are the problem!,5,0
corfu-airport,Ian Harrold,,Tom Phillips has got it just about right! We have just returned from Corfu from our 6th holiday there in seven years. Olympic Airways are simply choking the airport to death they will not allow enough flights to satisfy the demand from holiday makers and villa/studio owners. We hear the same old story all over the island too few flights and mostly on Fridays and Mondays from the UK. If it were not for the reps from the tour operators happily helping customers out inside the terminal half the flights would never get off the ground. The reps are great they help all travellers irrespective of who they are booked with. They seem to know that if they don't do there best to make it all work their jobs will inevitably be on the line before long. Shame that Olympic seem to be completely oblivious to this. Visitor numbers are visibly down this year and this is confirmed by restaurant owners car hire companies and those offering accomodation. I guess that that many who experienced the new systems at the airport last summer may not all have returned this year.,2,0
corfu-airport,Chris Nicholls,,After a number of years when the authorities did not care about its passengers the Corfu authorities seem to have got the formula right at last! It is still too small for the amount of people using the airport but it now does seem to run like a well oiled machine. The flights tend to be on time and the turn round of the aircraft seems efficient. Land and away in a little over an hour. However the departure lounge tends to be as overcrowed as it was when I first went to Corfu in 1985.,2,0
corfu-airport,Tom Phillips,,Passed through last week with family (eight pax including two small children). Sadly not only does Corfu never get better it’s now got even worse. The main problem is that nearly all charter flights arrive and depart at the same time on the same day so unless you’re arriving on a scheduled flight from Athens at some other time the place is always swamped. The arrivals hall is as cramped and smoky as ever with far too few luggage carousels; but it’s at departures that things have taken a nosedive. It used to be commonplace at check-in to see long queues snaking back outside the terminal onto the footpath. Be warned: this situation is now the norm. New (new to me: someone said they’d been in place for a year or more) ‘improved’ security procedures mean your hold luggage now has to be screened before check-in. As there are just four X-ray machines trying to screen up to a thousand passengers at the same time the overcrowding can be imagined. So the airport has hit on a novel solution: keep passengers outside until there’s space at the machines. Result: you are now asked to check in three hours before departure the first hour of which will be spent waiting outside in the sun until the check-in opens at which point the queue will be allowed to inch slowly into the terminal. On the day we left there were two queues on our side of the entrance two on the other with passengers waiting side-by-side. We got inside after about an hour and a quarter; spent another twenty minutes queuing for the X-ray; ten minutes checking in; ten more minutes at immigration then hurried into the equally cramped smoky departure lounge just as our flight was being called. Being in such a large group worked in our favour as half of us were able to sit inside with the kids while the others queued. We were also queuing next to the terminal wall outside which meant at least some shade. God help you if you’re stuck by the curb in the full glare of the sun. Bring sun block water and a hat. The irony is that Corfu could be quite a nice little airport: it’s clean and well-kept; there are pleasant places to eat and drink landside and even the snack bar in departures has a reasonable selection of food and drink. But it’s simply too small and ill-equipped to deal with such large numbers of passengers and these new procedures have made things much worse. Could they not spare a fraction of the enormous income generated by tourism each year to extend the building and/or buy another half-dozen X-ray machines? Sadly those of us who have been travelling to this island for years know the answer to that.,,0

cork-airport,Marie Hazelwood,Saudi Arabia,Lovely new spacious Terminal building but needs some atmosphere. Also need to return Rome to their departures listing. Airbridges would be useful as most of the times I've been through there it's raining and passengers get wet walking the tarmac to the terminal building then no lift to the next level only stairs.,7,1
cork-airport,R Sullivan,Ireland,Airport is great for tourist travel but poor for business. No fast track through security. Business lounge is small and poorly kept (dirty drinking glasses poor availability of food dirty tables). That's a pity as otherwise airport is great.,7,1
cork-airport,Allen Diarmuid,Ireland,Cork airport is a new modern building. I had no lost baggage. I flew with Aer Lingus. Airport has nice catering with cafes and shops. The loop is very nice. Easy accessible parking.,10,1
cork-airport,E Loverseed,United Kingdom,Nice airy new building spoilt by lack of airside facilities. No airbridge no hot food no water fountain. Free wi-fi though.,6,0
cork-airport,P O'Sullivan,Ireland,Clean spacious check in is quick and bag pick up on return is relatively quick - exactly what you want in a terminal to be fair. I have used this airport a number of times and its design makes the place look cavernous - some music on speakers please as there is no atmosphere whatsoever and it is always seems eerie quiet. Also no airbridges in 2012. Cork get it together! What is the point in having a palace of an airport only to walk across the tarmac in the pouring rain getting drenched the howling wind and cold! Also on arrival - one faces flights of stairs to get into the terminal - especially when you see a 2 airbridges idle and which appear out of use.,8,1
cork-airport,J Sonntag,Israel,MAN-ORK quick procedure in entrance small and easy to find everything good service counters.,5,0
cork-airport,B Bell,United Kingdom,I was impressed with the Terminal and facilities. A longish wait in Departures was no problem as its spacious and airy. Free Wi-Fi and decent book shop bonus points too.,5,0
cork-airport,M Haugh,,I haven't been to Cork since the new terminal building opened. On a Sunday morning the airport was quiet but we skipped through immigration and bags were back to us very quickly. The new layout is functional but it appears to work well.,4,0
cork-airport,T Ring,,Despite airbridges had to walk across a cold rain drenched apron likewise on departure. Then up two flights of stairs to get to passport control. A woman just bypassed the queue at this stage and walked out through an unmanned desk. Remarkable. Luggage took a while to arrive on the carousel our aircraft was the only one on the apron. Departure was more buisness like.,3,0
cork-airport,David Gartside,,Modern terminal; efficient staff; pleasant place to be. Would welcome a water fountain airside. If more airports were like this life would be better.,4,0
cork-airport,Kevin Penfold,,Landside the new terminal is very good check in desks very organised and good for snacks and meals bank wcs etc. Although airside is poor regarding food and drink outlets. Nice panoramic view of runway from departure gates and lounge area.,4,0
cork-airport,Brian Dromey,,The new terminal at Cork is much larger than the old one but is still easy to get around. The baggage halls are poor. There are also very few seating areas in baggage hall. The check-in halls and the departures areas are much better and have good views of the ramp area which is nice. There is also a much improved selection of eating areas before security although it is limited once airside.,,0
cork-airport,Alexander Mayhew,,New terminal just opened and looks very european - spacious good layout and good sign posting. New terminal only being used for arrivals at the minute and so departures was through the old terminal which was unfortunate. On departure the duty free shop sells books and magazines but no newspapers a sign says that newspapers are available for sale before you go through security but to get to the duty free shop in the first place you have to pass through security with no one allowed back out - I hope someone works that one out before the new terminal opens for departures.,,0
cork-airport,Simon Boxall,,An easy airport to get through. Current terminal is very small. Departure lounge has six gates but there are not enough seats for all the passengers of six flights. There were only three flights waiting to leave when I was there two weeks ago and already all the seats were taken with a large number of people standing. I hate to think what it would be like in the height of summer when all six gates are taken. However this should all be remedied when the new larger terminal building is opened. All the staff were friendly and helpful and adequate parking.,,0
cork-airport,Alan Wan,,Arrived there for a daytrip from LHR. It was quite a walk across the tarmac but this should be sorted when the new terminal is opened. On departure the eating facilities on landside were adequate for a small airport. On airside there was pretty much nothing to do. It was restricted to a very limited bar and the usual duty free shop,,0
cork-airport,Nico Nieuwstraten,,With the new automated Boarding Pass terminals the check-in is pretty speedy which makes the check-in efficient. Restaurant & bar upstairs are reasonable and deliver good quality food & drink (helpful staff!). Friendly ground-personnel and no need to run a marathon to reach the gate makes it a relaxing experience. Once you go though the security and passport check you seem to arrive in quite a different country all-together: 'tax-free' is a complete rip-off prices of salmon are triple(!) of that in Cork (same trademark and quantity) so duly you bleed for your families request. A cup of coffee at the bar suffers the same added-value while seemingly being made out a mixture of tarmac and dishwater here the personnel seems to be trained not to understand any language (I tried 3) and so ignoring my protest (he was probably rightfully to ashamed to respond). The permanent wind over the tarmac - Cork airport is on the top of a hill - blows you right in the direction of your plane. Arriving back is a breeze after a good lunch upstairs (I don't like the grub in planes) missing the bus I queried a cab-driver: € 42 for airport to Cobh so I informed him it was € 30 the other way around with a Cobh taxi firm his response: 'Ah ye see that's why we don't allow them for pickup any fares from here' welcome home.,,0
cork-airport,Brian Dromey,,Cork is handy with a Bus Eireann Coach service every 30 mins into Cork city itself. The city is not at all far away so if in a group I'd get a taxi. The airport has a very warm feeling at Christmas time when it welcomes all its lost sons and daughters home. I believe a planned expansion is about to take place? I would like to see more services between Cork & LHR not to mention international flights - perhaps all in time. The downside to this airport has to be its cafes and restaurants- especially airside- its terrible. Instead I find myself wandering aimlessly over the fragrances until my senses have been somewhat numbed. After which I'm ready to board a plane (usually to STN and its horrific onward connections).,,0
corpus-christi-airport,Simon Channon,United Kingdom,It looks like a white elephant but what an elegant one! Corpus Christi appears to handle only connecting flights to Dallas and Houston (that's the international bit) with just three airlines operating there. It is light bright airy and wonderfully free of the normal hustle and bustle of a modern airport. Checking in took three minutes; passport control and security about the same - they have new full body scanner. Each airline has its own gate complete with airbridge to connect even to small planes.,5,0
cotonou-airport,Kennet Foeh,Denmark,Very small airport. Check-in starts 1.5-2 hours before departure. The small cafe on the right is the only place with a clean toilet and AC. When you have checked in there is nothing! It is the most boring airport. Filthy toilets. No info at all about departures - if they are late. You know when the planes are leaving - a lady shouts out. It is a bit of a joke but no waiting time due to the small size of the airport. The AC is not working outside the cafe so it is a bit too hot.,4,1
cotonou-airport,Hans Van Gaever,Belgium,Actually more of a bus stop than an airport. There are no facilities besides a pharmacy and getting through security is pure horror. The whole thing simply looks as if it hasn't had the slightest bit of maintenance since the day it was built.,1,0
cotonou-airport,A Stroh,Germany,"Modern facade entry and check-in ok though crowed when large planes are scheduled. However behind the easy border post it gets worse. Only restaurant (rather a shabby bar) before the security check. No refreshment facility after the slow security. So don't go to the airport too early (though the airline will urge you). It's terrible to sit more than an hour on very uncomfortable seats in the departure hall (if any available) or in the bar. European airlines have their own security check before boarding. Arrival is chaotic and terribly crowed if arriving on a larger plane particularly at the baggage claim. Be prepared to ""fight"" you through to the belt while receiving some elbow checks and bruises. Friendly staff.",2,0
coventry-airport,M Hewitt,,I live in Valencia and work in the UK and use the round trip service fortnightly and have done so from the beginning with thomsonfly. Although the facilities are small and limited at Coventry this seemed to be reflected in the cheaper flight prices and at the same time suits my needs of a reliable bus service to and from Valencia. But recently I have noticed the flight prices increasing without the offer of discounts for regular flyers with this in mind I have looked elsewhere. Staff at Coventry are polite friendly and helpful but it will be all in vain if you have no customers.,4,0
coventry-airport,Michael Lynch,,Use the airport regularly and it's great parking facilities are next to the terminal so no need to go on a five mile cross country slog with children in tow nor wait for a packed shuttle boss and try and cram all luggage and children on board. As stated before the airport is small and basic (understatement) but then again I don't use airports to sit in or spend all my holiday money in shops before i even depart the UK something which I think happens at many of the larger airports. A very short walk from the terminal (the interim passenger facility as it is more technically known) to the plane and then you are away on your flight. Coming back is so easy as well the arrivals area is a seperate building from departures. If two planes arrive at the same time then I am under the impression that one has to wait for a short period of time foir the arrivals area to clear. However after disembarking getting through passport control and getting to the baggage claim belt we were waiting for about two minutes and then hey presto the bags started coming through. Again a very short walk to the car park (ever present taxis and an hourly bus service to/from the railway station and city centre are also available) and we were off...home within 30 minutes of landing...at a bigger airport just down the A45 I have been waiting for 30 minutes just for the baggage carousel to start revolving. All in #all it is basic but it does exactly what it says on the tin - it's a building (well two buildings) for passengers getting to or arriving from a city by air - and it does this with minimum of fuss and least amount of time. In some ways it is a good alternative for any inbound passengers wishing to avoid the congested London Airports - the bus to the railway station and frequent trains to the centre of London could have you in the capital very easily. Here's hoping for the new terminal an increase in services and more airlines. I know I shall be a regular user of Coventry Airport and so shall my friends family and colleagues for many years to come.,5,0
coventry-airport,K Hammond,,Flew from Coventry for the second time. We found the trick was to check- in and then go to the café across the road before continuing to departures. (There's nothing there but a little 'shop' and toilets.) Watch out if there's 2+ flights as the limited seating can fill quickly with full flights. No problems with the baggage or staff. Return flight was cancelled however due to 'inappropriate landing facilities' at the airport due to the bad fog. Small airport good in general but could do with some major improvement if there's going to be a big passenger increase.,,0
coventry-airport,Rachel Litchfield,,"This was the first time we had used Coventry Airport to travel to Barcelona. Having been used to departing from the larger airports oh how we laughed!! The porter cabin style check in and the cattle shed style arrivals made us laugh and laugh. The coffee shop was like having a cup of tea in your front room. What fun to be escorted to the plane by the same person who checked us in we wouldn't have been suprised if they had flown the plane too! The only hitch was when we arrived back there was already a flight in we were held on the plane while they found someone to escort us to the so called terminal? We giggled at the thought of someone shouting ""Stan! Can you leave the loo cleaning and get the next lot off the Barcelona flight?"" We will be using Coventry again if only for a good laugh.",,0
coventry-airport,James Dowler,,I travelled from Coventry to Naples this year and found the airport limited but satisfactory. The checkin area reminded me of the old days with cardboard flight destination signs and this was an area that could be easily changed for the better. The lines crossed each other to the destinations and did cause some friction between customers. The car parking was an experience but again was satisfactory. I do not understand why the local bus companies especially those going to Leamington. Stratford do not call in. On returning the baggage was certainly a LOT better than Birmingham so a plus there. In the departure lounge there was a good choice of food and drink at great prices - no rip off here. Also a small point . The newspapers were out and available from about 0500. Birmingham they are still under wraps at 0600. Good value and friendly. Hope they get permission for the bigger one soon.,,0
crown-point-tobago-airport,L Joslin,United Kingdom,Flying in to Tobago airport you will find minimal facilities with x-ray or your baggage being the norm (you'll wait a while for your cases!). The experience when flying back out was underwhelming. The 'check in' area is outside the main building in the heat long queues and staff who are happy to chat to eat other mill about and lack any kind of customer service. You'd expect that 'departures' is open all the time. Nope. Again you have to wait outside with no aircon - just a ceiling mounted fan just outside the entrance - and wait until the staff decide they're ready/bothered to 'open'. The best I can say is that the grunts of communication were followed up by pointing at what you needed to do and where to go. Appalling and very slow. The departure lounge itself has air con but the plastic seats (part of the airport upgrade!) are shockingly uncomfortable. If you want duty free shopping you're limited to a small shop about the size of a single bedroom with vodka rum and a few bits and bobs a perfume/soap shop and souvenir stall with t-shirts keyrings and beach bags. There is a small counter area where you can buy drinks and snacks (this is not Costa). You may be sad to leave Tobago but the airport will encourage you to get on your flight.,1,0
crown-point-tobago-airport,Michael Lochrie,United Kingdom,By far the worst Caribbean airport I have had the misfortune to ever visit. Arrived with Monarch unfortunately Monarch Cabin crew wrongly advised passengers with children under 18 they only had to fill one immigration form with the child's details on the back (which is what the form says). Having queued for over 90 mins to be told we needed to fill a form for each person multiply that 10 to 15 times on our flight chaos ensued. One fan in that whole arrivals hall had youngsters fainting after the 9 hour flight. When we got past passport control we got to baggage reclaim with the fastest belt I have ever seen (great that allowed quick retrieval of cases) only to join another queue to get our luggage X-rayed the same cases that were x-rayed at Gatwick as we waited the baggage belt overfilled with the passengers from row 16 back to row 40+ on the plane jammed at the exit door and piled into each other causing a jam with no airport staff to be seen a passenger eventually hit the stop button. We eventually got out after 2 hours the airport maybe be able to handle endless ATR-72s from Trinidad but not an A330 and Monarch have been going there since at least 2005 when I was in transit from Grenada. I love the Island but would never come back through the airport where no welcome was given anyone tourist or resident.,,0
crown-point-tobago-airport,Andre Franca,Brazil,I have been once to this airport as others said the place is tiny I wonder how it looks when BA and Virgin are around. Boarding into small propeller planes is already a mess they search your bags at the boarding area even though you have already had your carry-on x-rayed.,7,1
crown-point-tobago-airport,J Hutchison,,I have used Crown Point airport 5 times over the last 6 years and each time I return I pray the airport service has improved. Unfortunately this has not been the case. Customer Service remains a missing module from the staff training. I can only imagine that much training is dedicated to being rude and unhelpful to the weary travellers. The security staff appear to be on a mission on to be as difficult possible searching everyone irrelevant it the metal detector beeps or not. And the words please and thank you devoid from their vocabulary. On my last departure from Crown Point (and it will be my last) two international flights were due to leave within 2 hours of each other. The duty free had no cigarettes and the alcohol was extremely limited. The cafe (charging inflated prices) had no sandwiches and were ill prepared for the demand. Two staff took 5 mins to serve one person with 1 bottle of water. The ladies toilets has three cubicles and a queue to match a bank holiday sale in Harrods. I strongly recommend the management of Crown Point visit somewhere like Thailand to see how you can be efficient and polite. Crown Point International Airport I think not. Good luck if you use it to depart from you will need it with lots and lots of patience.,1,0
crown-point-tobago-airport,L O'Shea,,Arriving at the airport was quick and easy. However trying to leave the island is difficult is not extremely unpleasant. The few shops in the departure lounge were closed when we got through customs. Even though we had plenty of time and were the only 2 people waiting they would not let us go downstairs and get any food or water. They were rude and made it perfectly clear they were annoyed with us. On top of that they kept telling us to stay on one side of the departure area. Just make sure you get whatever food/drink/souvenirs you want before going upstairs to the departure gate.,1,0
crown-point-tobago-airport,Marc de Verteuil,,Outdated tiny airport. If a large plane is either disembarking or embarking the facilities are stretched beyond capacity. The staff are not properly trained and often rude. The Caribbean Airlines flights to Trinidad can be a hit and miss affair and if one if using Tobago Crown Point to transfer from an international flight to a Trinidad bound flight or vice versa be prepared to be told that your flight is overbooked delayed cancelled.,1,0
crown-point-tobago-airport,Michael Goebel,,I flew into and out of Crown Point from Frankfurt once flew out of of Tobago to Trinidad and on two other occasions tried to do just that without success. The airport is very small mostly handling flights from and to Trinidad. There are very few amenities inside but most of the crucial ones on the concourse just outside (ATM fast food etc.). The staff at migrations and customs upon arrival was friendly and helpful but flying from Crown Point proved an utter nightmare on two occasions. While international flights are handled relatively smoothly the staff dealing with the short-haul Caribbean Airlines trips to Trinidad was exceptionally incompetent and unhelpful. Several flights were cancelled and at no point were passengers informed of this fact. Time and again long queues formed at the check-in counter which none of the about ten people standing behind this counter believed necessary to attend for three (!) hours. When asked to provide even the most essential information on which to base a decision staff would still not inform us about the cancellation of the flight. In the end we spent one entire day at this airport without being able to fly. By far the most shocking airport experience I have had in many years of travelling compounded by unbelievably rude and unqualified staff. My only advice is to take the ferry when travelling from Tobago to Trinidad.,1,0
curacao-airport,Kai Wulf,Netherlands Antilles,"Curaçao is an important hub in the Southern Caribbean. In terms of quality of services provided, facilities, friendliness of staff and officials, it doesn't come close to the level of other hubs, e.g. St. Maarten. Although some cosmetic upgrades were made, the facilities are in dire need of modernization. The food courts are a rip off, horrible menu items at exorbitant prices, taking advantage of your misery during long layovers and the usual delays, having no choice, but to purchase inferior nutrition. The air conditioning never seems to work properly and you have to be lucky to even log on to the public wifi. Forget about any business correspondence via email and seeking refuge in the below standard executive lounge. If you can, avoid the airport.",2,0
curacao-airport,Dante Vargas,Czech Republic,Flew in with AB from DUS. CUR is a small Airport that has drastically improved over the years overall it is looking great for its size. However it is clear the Airport cannot handle the traffic though I suspect This could also be poor planning. IC Flights to DUS and AMS open at the same time. Together with regional flights it's simply too much for the Airport to handle without impact on customer service and comfort. Massive queues everywhere. Check-In Security Immigration Toilets and even at the Shops etc. All because approximately 1000 pax are at the airport at the same time.,7,1
curacao-airport,T Bos,Netherlands,Small clean airport quick passport checks and the luggage was arriving quickly. It seems well maintained there is enough place to have a drink or have something to eat.,3,0
curacao-airport,John van den Berg,,A total drama in arrivals especially in the afternoon when KLM ArkeFly and Martinair arrive. There is only 1 luggage carrousel and you can imagine the mess. The airbridges often do not work and the paint of the building is already coming of. During rain seazon the whole checkin area is under water. This airport looks nice from the outside but is full of problems from the insite.,1,0
curacao-airport,Andre Souza,,Quite cosy and small airport immigration is great and hassle free! There is a nice bar outside with modern dance music you can enjoy a beer and snack before flying. Check-in lines are long - make sure to check-in online to avoid hassle. Tax fee is quite high.,4,0
curacao-airport,R Pieters,,I recently had the pleasure to travel through the new Curacao intl airport. I'm very pleased with the new airport. It is very efficient from the outside it has a beautiful typical Dutch Caribbean facade and there are plenty of shops and cafe's to hang out. Staff is very friendly only the immigration customs could to with a customer service course.,4,0
curacao-airport,Christiaan Criens,,They just built a new departure and arrival building. The departure area is beautiful. The floor were you check in is huge. It’s isn’t hot at all although their isn’t air-conditioning. They designed it so that it’s cool all year round. But they made a huge mistake with the arrival area. For big planes like a Boeing 747-400 they only have one exit on the plane. Our biggest company on Curacao KLM had a Boeing 747-400 flying over from the Netherlands everyday. But now because it takes so long to empty the plane they decided to send a smaller plane. This means less tourists each day. Also the airport raised its airport taxes a few years ago it was only 20 dollars now it’s 32 dollars. Some people may think this isn’t a lot but consider this. One of our own plane companies named DEA also flies to Aruba. A ticked to Aruba costs 62 dollars. In that perspective 32 dollars is a lot for people living on Curacao.,2,0
cusco-airport,J Wong-Rolle,United States,"We were stranded in line for LAN Peru at the Cusco airport. Due to LAN's incompetence, it took over 3 hours for us to talk to someone. Their customer service folks were not able to rebook us, and took forever to deal with each traveling group. Not enough reps were there either. As time wore on the problems with the airport restrooms became aggravated. No toilet paper and at 8pm, no more flushing or washing of hands. They shut off the water! Not enough seating and they had all the doors open so it was freezing. We couldn't get out of line or lose our places. No food or water available after 8:30pm for sale anywhere in the airport. We couldn't leave until we saw the rep so stuck in the freezing cold. Upstairs waiting area being torn up and not enough seating either.",1,0
da-nang-airport,Peter J Thackray,United Kingdom,Arrived on a domestic flight. There are five boarding gates. Baggage Reclaim relatively quick and Luggage Tags checked against Baggage Tags before exit into Arrivals hall. There were OK toilets in the Baggage Hall. A reasonable range of shops and support facilities at the airport in the main areas.,7,1
da-nang-airport,Mat Mayer,United Kingdom,Very nice airport with comfortable seats. Unfortunately completely ruined by the sound system which is far too loud. Turn the volume down and you have a decent hotel. Our flight was delayed which led to a horrific time with the screaming women announcing in three languages every few minutes. Louder than a nightclub at times.,,0
da-nang-airport,TK Hill,Vietnam,Nice new airport very similar to the new airport in Phu Quoc. Clean and spacious with more than adequate food and drink options. Lots of seating. Very helpful staff. Very good ratings overall. The number of people who cannot read the conspicuous no smoking signs in the bathrooms is a bit remarkable given Vietnam's very high literacy rate.,9,1
da-nang-airport,Anders Pedersen,Denmark,What a pleasurable new modern smart airport built right after the old one which buildings now are used for other purposes. Da Nang airport is located in the middle of town and extremely easy to reach and vacate. It is very effective with clear signage quick check-in fast security easy to find lounges not too many shops good view from glass facades and with all the advantages of being a relatively small airport: everything is within reach in 2 Minutes. VN lounge is good they serve even real food as an alternative to industrial pre-packed food.,8,1
da-nang-airport,TK Hill,Vietnam,Very impressive new airport. Clean spacious and acoustically efficient. Several international carriers are flying into Da Nang these days. Expect DAD to get busier and busier.,8,1
da-nang-airport,Y Khor,Malaysia,The new terminal is clean and airy. It is still basic but fine enough for a small Asian airport. The security process was slow especially when they dealt with Caucasian-looking tourists. However the rest was amazing and there was a helpful tourist information which is quite visible within the security area. As expected most members of staff can only manage very simple English but they were quite helpful. The airport is a stone's throw away from town but walking is not quite possible due to government facilities with armed guards lining the way out from the airport. Taxis are cheap and most use the meter + 15000 dong for airport services.,10,1
da-nang-airport,Jamie Mackinnon,Australia,The new airport a huge improvement from the dated one next door the business class lounge with reasonable amenities from buffet style food and cold beer and juices available from the self serve fridge newspapers in English and free internet available. Comfortable seating with a view to the runway business class check-in very smooth with your own line for security check so no waiting. All in all a well designed modern airport my only gripe is it takes some time waiting for your visa on arrival to process once you get to immigration especially if another flight has arrived there should be more immigration officers on the counters for a smoother flow of passengers.,9,1
da-nang-airport,T Kimberley,United Kingdom,The airport terminal is new and has everything you would expect from a new set up. Check-in was swift and there were no delays at security.

da-nang-airport,C Whittell,United Kingdom,Quite unbelievable. Flying in from Ho Chi Minh we thought 'this looks like a small airport'. Flying out was quite bizarre. The departure lounge is like a bus station waiting area - granny's curtains at the dirty windows and row after row of hard seats. One counter selling water and snacks. Another selling a few books. TV in the corner blaring away in Vietnamese. Smoking area is the corridor leading to the departure gate for Jetstar's flight to Hanoi. Unkempt and dirty they've obviously given up on the place. Ex-military and you really get the vibe it's for processing only. Thank goodness their new airport next door is almost finished.,2,0
da-nang-airport,D Grinder,New Zealand,Arrived on a VN flight from Saigon. Of course there was a two hour delay arriving in Da Nang at 7:30 with the other VN flight from Saigon we were stuck with a million other people (2 A330's I believe) and only one very slow luggage belt. Took about 25 minutes for my bag to come through and as a high school tour group we had to wait a further 40-45 minutes until the final 3 bags came through. Outside is a mess. Lucky they are building a proper terminal next door to replace the tin shed they currently have.,2,0
da-nang-airport,D McCarthy,,In a word - horrible! The most positive thing about this airport is it closeness to the CBD - not that Da Nang is a wonderful metropolis either. God help the elderly/wheelchair customers once they check in and have to navigate 3 flights of stairs - no lift access. As previously mentioned you are plonked in a Waiting area with seats and not much else. Obviously a very old airport which has NEVER been updated. No boarding calls made whatsoever - just noticed everyone rushing towards the ticket counter only to walk down 3 more flights of stairs then plonked on a bus to drive you out to the plane.,2,0
da-nang-airport,Hal Young,,"Airport is very close to town. Was a US military base and it appears that few changes have been done since the US left (even the US ""welcome"" sign is still on the roof of the original terminal).

There are no true shops in the departure area only counters like in a department store where a very limited selection of items is on sale. Very limited food and bar service was available. The airport is a big step down from an airport like Tan San Nhat (SGN) in Ho Chi Min City.",2,0

dakar-airport,M Gough,,Flew out from Senegal to Madrid. Check in is clean bright and very efficient at the Iberia desk. security was rigorous but very well mannered. Passport control wasn't quick. Airside not too bad range of shops but the cafe sells the worst coffee I have ever drunk. For some reason all European flights take off late at night but save that we took off only 5 minutes late. Been to far worse American airports than this. Promise of a new airport seems some way off but would not be adverse to departing from there again.,3,0
dakar-airport,Mark Hereward,,"Transiting in Dakar airport from Cape Verde to New York. Bussed in from the plane waited for a while at the space marked ""Transit"" until someone arrived (with some prodding). Then he said I shouldn't go through there (as I had a European passport) I should ""faire le tour"" meaning go through immigration. Anyway he let us in and then someone came to the transfer desk but said ""No we can't do this here you have to 'faire le tour'"". So (luckily have a UK passport so didn't need visa) I filled out the entry form queued up went through immigration and past baggage claim then found a queue to get into the check-in area and a monster crowd around the check-in desks. Happily as I was in business class and had no bags to check and was anyway on transfer they let me by-pass the queues to check in and then by-pass most of the amazing queues for immigration to leave Senegal again. But it still took an astonishing 90 minutes from getting off the bus to arriving back in the departure gate and got to the really comfortable business-class lounge.",2,0
dakar-airport,James Faulkner,,Flew in from Joburg on a New York bound flight landed at 2am and was the only English speaking person in the air port. Despite my surfboard being lost and difficulties explaining what a surf board is arrival was fairly easy. Airport very shabby and old looking but this is west africa. Customs was virtually non existent on arrival but strict on departing. Beware of the Taxis and the people offering to change money for you. A taxi to Dakar should cost no more than 8 to 10 cfa dont be conned. Look for a cab away from the entrance near the bus stop (across road on the right side) is your best bet. Don't be harassed and don't get into a taxi with more than the driver onboard. Keep your wits about you.,,0
dakar-airport,Ingvar Backéus,,Fresh breeze with a smell of seaweed that you might experience when you leave the plane. You will then probably end up in a long slowly moving queue for the passport control still dressed in your much-too-warm clothes from Europe. Last time we passed there the area beyond the passport control was crowded and rather chaotic. To pass quietly the customs control without any checking was therefore not so difficult. Travellers not used to African conditions will probably also find the taxi drivers quite difficult to handle; have an appointment with somebody beforehand if possible. On departure the main difficulty was to find the right counter; otherwise it went smoothly. Anyway the Senegalese seem to be aware that the situation is not the best possible for a new airport is said to be underway. We flew Air France. As Delta Airlines has a code-share on this flight one would expect check-in staff to have some knowledge of English but that was hardly the case. Should not Delta Airlines demand that their customers can be served in English?,,0
dalaman-airport,C McNally,United Kingdom,There is a recurring theme here. That is re: the food prices. Simple solution stop paying the prices. Somebody said they had to pay 77 lira  no you didn't but let me guess you did anyway so as to not cause a scene. We never ever buy at the airport the only thing is water which is costly but not as bad as juice etc. The thing I would like to see is more comfortable seating in departures and more seating at departure gates. Apart from that airport is ok better than what it was bearing in mind it was a military airport! All airports are the same re: prices UK is almost as bad with their prices and yet people still pay >£10 for a breakfast crazy.,7,1
dalaman-airport,J Southwell,United Kingdom,Clean and not hot when we visited. Queues orderly and efficient. However food exorbitant as previously stated but airport lounge equally poor. Pre purchase tickets online or as before you will be paying extra if pay on the day due to conversion rate. CPE lounge badly run staff out of their depth do not monitor who is using the lounge and unhelpful. Acres of space with no seating. Whoever heard of using a premium lounge and having to sit on the floor. Supposed to be a two hour usage but this arbitrary which increased the seating problem.,5,1
dalaman-airport,R Cook,United Kingdom,"Whoever is responsible for the running of this airport should be fired and replaced by someone has knows how to run a business and give customers what they want. I have never seen such an amateurish airport operation anywhere else in the world. The shops and food outlets are generally empty as the prices are so extortionate. If the prices were realistic sales volume would increase and they would start to make some real profits. As it is they seem be making 100% of nothing. The other reviews already given by others have listed all of its other shortcomings so it's time that the powers-that-be took note and sorted out their act. Turkey and its people are wonderful and it's a shame that many visitors dread passing through this airport. I shall be flying to and from Dalaman yet again in October and it would be nice if the airport operators ""got it"" and made the necessary changes to improve customer expectations and as a consequence increase profits. Shouldn't be difficult. I decided to write this review after considering using the CIP Executive Lounge on my next visit. Usual story - sky-high price and little on offer. I'll be using the hard wooden seats as usual!",,0
dalaman-airport,David Stalker,United Kingdom,The worst airport I have been to. Re scanning suitcases on arrival I have seen this at another airport but cannot remember where. The prices are the worst I have experienced. Why are the duty free prices in Euros? When they convert them to Turkish Lira the exchange rate is a rip off. The airport was like a sauna no air con going. The seats wooden and very uncomfortable. We were lucky our flight was on time but some peoples flight were 3 hours late. We had a great holiday in a great country where the people were great why spoil it with a disgusting airport.,1,0
dalaman-airport,D Lovatt,United Kingdom,Anyone flying out of Dalaman should be prepared for extortionate rip off prices in the departure lounge. We had to pay 77 lira (£26) for two cheese sandwiches 2 coffees and 2 small bottles of water. The coffees alone were 14 lira (£4.80) each for a small cardboard cup of rubbish and the sandwiches were 20 lira (£6.80) each. I would suggest that you take food with you and stick to the water.,1,0
dalaman-airport,J Hutchinson,United Kingdom,The airport is 'modern' but basically looks like the inside of a factory or warehouse. Having been in Turkey for a week we were aware that everywhere excepts Stirling so as we had run out of lira we didn't bother converting any more. As such the prices at the airport were even more extortionate! Lastly was the time we had to wait for our visa! Out of about a dozen booths only about 3 were open and we waited over 45 minutes simply to get our visa! They could certainly do with more staff working in this area! Overall the airport is a rip off for tourists and a disgrace to the Turkish people all of whom we met were lovely people.,1,0
dalaman-airport,S Prescott,United Kingdom,Not sure what the point of these reviews is if nothing every changes for the better but I concur with other comments about the food prices in the airport. They are indeed extortionate and shouldn't be allowed. My daughter bought a 6 nugget meal and a double cheeseburger at McDonalds and it was 19.40 (she paid in Lira). I know people suggest taking food with you but it wasn't possible to keep it cool on the transfer journey from Hisaronu and drinks need to be discarded anyway. As a result we paid the equivalent of££4 each for a can of coke. If you're travelling with a family you've often not always got a lot of money left on the last day of your holiday and it's important to keep children hydrated but at Dalaman airport I fear a lot of people will end up very thirsty/hungry!,5,0
dalaman-airport,Ross Stewart,United Kingdom,I flew home from Dalaman airport a week ago and have to say I was absolutely disgusted with the pricing for food in the terminal. I don't mind paying 15 euros for a decent meal in a restaurant but£15 euros for fast food such as McDonald's KFC and Burger King is criminal. Air conditioning does need some work / updating. It was such a shame because we really did enjoy our stay in Turkey but this really did leave a bitter taste in my mouth for my return home.,3,0
dalaman-airport,S Sharman,United Kingdom,Did not like Dalaman Airport. Check -in took along time. Air conditioning was not turned on. Food and drink was really expensive and the airport was gloomy and dark. So glad I didn't have a delay there because it was also quite a small airport and there wasn't that many shops.,1,0
dalaman-airport,J O'Donoghue,United Kingdom,Just flown back from Dalaman airport and it was fine. There was ample comfortable seating air conditioning the staff were pleasant and the check in process relatively quick. We did take our own snacks so didn't have to buy food there. The shops were good and the prices were pretty much comparable to other European airports. Announcements were clear and our flight left before expected time. No complaints!,8,1
dalaman-airport,L Turner,United Kingdom,The prices of food and drink are shocking beyond belief! I can't believe they are allowed to get away with it. These prices need looking into. A great pity because beyond the airport Turkey is a wonderful country. Get rid of the airport management quick before their reputation stops people visiting the Dalaman area.,3,0
dalaman-airport,C Parkes,United Kingdom,As per a previous comment flying into Dalaman is a relatively painless experience but flying out is a nightmare. You are herded like cattle spoken to (shouted at) like idiots and then required to take out the equivalent of a mortgage for the privilege of buying a drink before you leave the country. Yesterday I was charged the equivalent of £12 for a cup of coffee and a cheese salad roll (soggy). Also beware if you want to pay in GBP as they conjure up an imaginary exchange rate which is at least 10% lower than normal. I would encourage everyone to take sufficient food to the airport to cover the wait & deny these disgusting money grabbers a single lire or your hard earned cash. Also I would briefly say that the seating is very uncomfortable the staff pretend not to understand if there is any problem and the toilets are diabolical.,3,0
dalaman-airport,H Wainwright,United Kingdom,Poor air conditioning - too hot - announcements too quiet to hear - baggage offload a joke. The whole place looks unfinished. Staff unfriendly - unlike the country which we love. Food expensive and poor quality. Avoid!,1,0
dalaman-airport,D Murdoch,United Kingdom,Arriving at Dalaman: Is perfectly fine. Baggage is always pretty much waiting for you the longest we have waited is 10 minutes. The VISA queues can be slow but that is mainly because people don't have the correct money ready. Departing from Dalaman: Absolute joke of a place. We love Turkey and have been 6 times but the one thing I always dread is going home. Rude security. Useless check in staff that can't add up 13 kg + 15 kg does not equal 48 kg! Extortionate prices for food and drink. Useless boarding staff. Need I go on!,2,0
dalaman-airport,A Green,United Kingdom,Very expensive! Please take some food/drinks with you. In our attempt to get rid of our last remaining Lira we thought we'd use it in the McDonalds (only food place that was open). However we didn't have enough as one meal will set you back over £20! Aside from the expense the Terminal is a new one and is fairly comfortable. Could do with speeding up check-in and security however!,4,1
dalaman-airport,S Jones,United Kingdom,This airport's prices are disgusting - so expensive! I would advise you take your own food! Not enough seats while your waiting at the gates to board you will find it very hot and stuffy and most likely have to end up sitting on the floor! Terminals however are very clean but the toilets are not.,5,0
dalaman-airport,S Francis,United Kingdom,This airport is only interested in getting an extra buck. Last year they charged for excess luggage which we didn't have. This year our allowance was 15 kilos each we bought luggage scales and weighed our case which was well short of the weight but they tried to charge us again for being over weight. Be careful if you use this airport. Price of food drink and duty free is also extortionate.,1,0
dalaman-airport,David Thorn,United Kingdom,In and out of Turkey via Dalaman Airport. Every one says expensive so on leaving we took our own food but you have to buy a drink. €3.20 for one tin of Coke - rip-off! Turkish tourist authorities should be investigating the crooks who run this airport. Worse was the toilets - disgusting is a polite description. We used the Ladies and Gents on the way in once and twice each before leaving not a pleasant experience. Each had one electric hand dryer - none working no paper towels in dispenser no soap in any dispensers I used one cubicle - no paper excrement stains under/around seat (obviously never lifted and cleaned properly and allowed to build up as a hard stain). That was our experience across 5 separate WC's. Perhaps two reasons not to visit Turkey via this dump - cost and hygiene. This part of Turkey is now off our list for a revisit!,1,0
dalaman-airport,L Greenwood,United Kingdom,Personally have never had a problem going in or out of Dalaman. Maybe its the times of arrivals and departures etc. On arrival our luggage is usually coming around by the time we get there only negatives as mentioned before are the food and drink prices but this can be avoided by taking your own food through. The only other thing I don't like is if travelling easyjet they should have an area cordoned off for Speedy Boarders at the moment it is a bun fight to get through the gates. Some people not caring that we have paid for the privilege to get onboard first to choose our seats.,4,0
dalaman-airport,M Bury,United Kingdom,I have flown from Dalaman a few times and never had a plane leave on time. In fairness that's not the fault of the airport but they don't seem to care about stranded passengers. There are hundreds of wooden-slat benches around but they are designed to be impossible to lie on. If you're lucky you can snag a sofa but the rest of us have to lie on the floor - next to nobody uses the benches those that do usually regret it. The food is tremendously expensive. The whole place has an oppressive 'prison' feel about it. The check-in queues are very slow. The gates' seating areas are inadequate instructions and plane updates are woefully lacking. The floor does appear to be fairly clean.,1,0
dalaman-airport,A Crossley,United Kingdom,An extremely expensive airport. I love Turkey but when they charge you £10 to go in and rip you off coming out it can leave a bitter taste to your holiday. They even try to get you into trouble at the duty free shop with staff saying you can bring several thousand cigarettes back to UK when you can only bring 200 at duty free. I think long term it will deter people from visiting Turkey.,1,0
dalaman-airport,M Fokinther,United Kingdom,The one huge negative at Dalaman is the cost of food & drink - £1.60 of 300ml of water or £8 for a McDonalds Burger are indeed indefensible prices. Having said that though I found the airport to be pretty good. Very clear lots of seating fair selection of shops and helpful staff.,4,0
dalaman-airport,C Hanson,United Kingdom,Can only agree with what others have said the prices are extremely expensive. If you're travelling to the airport and with TCX or TOM then wait until you're on the coach - the waters are 2 for £1. On your inbound flight bring sandwiches and liquids. Drink it in the area before you get to the gates conditions there aren't good - there is limited seating. Luckily the Manchester flight was the only one running on time people going to Aberdeen had a 2hr delay and Gatwick was 4hrs delayed.,1,0
dalaman-airport,Y Waldron,Ireland,We have just returned from Turkey and would agree with all the comments about the rip off culture at the airport. I would like to warn people not to buy from duty free either. They have a unique system of pricing in Euro and then converting to Lira at check-out. It is much better to buy on the way out. Istanbul is also a very expensive airport (Ataturk). The airlines are now warning people not to buy any food or drink at airport in Dalaman. What a pity to have that awful experience as you leave such a wonderful country.,1,0
dalaman-airport,Steve Dawson,United Kingdom,If your flight is on time you will cope by taking a packed lunch and peanuts etc and your own drinks. Consume drinks at the last minute! If you book your seats and check in online you can afford to go airside as late as possible.,1,0
dalaman-airport,C Wilkinson,United Kingdom,I have been visiting Turkey for many years. The airport staff are rude sullen unhelpful and bear no relation to the wonderful Turkish people I have met on holiday. The management of the bar should be ashamed of themselves. I paid 60 Turkish lira for a glass of wine and a small pringles! There is no justification for these prices.,1,0
dalaman-airport,L McKinnie,United Kingdom,We've been a few times and Dalaman Airport is an endurance test! It's so at odds with the Turkey - with miserable staff awful food at ridiculous prices and no thought for the poor human beings passing through! We flew home Mid May which isn't a terribly hot time of year but the airport was stifling and uncomfortable. The seating is awful a wooden bar design that is just so uncomfortable for even a few minutes never mind a couple of hours. There aren't enough seats at the departure gates for all on the flight so you'll often end up sat on the floor. It is clean spacious with plenty of clean toilets - but it's just not enough to counteract the sheer misery of the rest of it! Tips : Wear summer clothes with something warmer to change into on the plane or at home. A lot of people leave their drinks at the first scan (at the front door as you go in) but you can keep your drinks at this point and while you check in and until the next scan just before passport control. Once you're through passport control you're only a couple of minutes from your gate so leave it a while before going through so you can drink. Take food with you as everyone says - prices are just stupid. As not many people buy food I'd worry a bit about how long sandwiches have been sitting out! If your luggage may be over your limit you'll be charged by most airlines. Have a look round at empty check in desks as they usually leave their scales switched on so you can check your weight and adjust bags accordingly. If you are delayed or fancy a more pleasant experience check out the VIP lounge (CIP Premium Lounge there). We've not been in but you pay a flat fee (I think 20 Euros) have air con food and drinks newspapers WiFi. It's up by the food court.,1,0
dalaman-airport,James Titcumb,United Kingdom,Dingy and dull airport. No air conditioning thus very hot and stuffy everywhere. Enormous queue outside the airport just to get in it was chaos and took us about a half an hour just to get into the airport. Why is there a security gate just to get in the airport? The Visa charge is a little bit of a rip-off but I can cope with that. I can't cope with spending £8 just for two milkshakes at McDonalds. Not a child-friendly airport at all I'd try another airport if you have young children. The buses were crammed with far too many people as well I have a mild fear of being in a crowd I can't escape from and it was horrible.,1,0
dalaman-airport,T Platts,United Kingdom,Just in case other people do not know. If you hand a £20.00 or £50.00 note to pay for a visa you will not get change. They will not accept £5.00 so make sure you have the correct note.,1,0
dalaman-airport,K McDonald,United Kingdom,The experience at Dalaman airport is the polar opposite of our experience in Turkey. Staff sullen and unhelpful. Prices three times the norm and majority of the food available is of the fast variety - ie. rubbish. All in all a very unpleasant experience. I would seriously avoid this airport at all costs in future and visit Turkey via another airport if possible. Maybe if others do the same they might get the message.,1,0
dalaman-airport,P O'Brien,United Kingdom,Just arrived back from Turkey via Dalaman Airport - holiday but was ruined by my experience at this airport. Security screening and check in was fine but when they opened the gate for boarding it was absolute chaos. They didn't call for passengers disabled or with children to come forward first. Nor did they call people in certain rows. There were two flights for the same gate 34 and people were confused about which queue to be in as no direction was given. Then they couldn't get buses to take passengers to the plane last call was flashing on the screen and 100's of passengers were still waiting to be transported to the plane. It must have been a frightening experience for elderly and disabled people. I don't think I could face this airport again. Thankfully we did not purchase any food here as we had been warned in advance about the outrageous prices.,3,0
dalaman-airport,Stuart Scaife,United Kingdom,Check in queues were long and slow but apart from that things were fine. Plenty of seating (at 4am) - 2 coffees and 2 pastries for £5 (at the departure gate).,4,0
dalaman-airport,L Martin,United Kingdom,The whole administration gives the impression of no organisation. Although I had checked the 5 of us in online we had to stand in the bag drop queue for an hour because they rechecked in everybody in the queue. There were also lots of people in the bag drop queue who had not checked in. Very poor end to a great stay in the area.,1,0
dalaman-airport,M Shortridge,United Kingdom,How I wish I had read these reviews before going on holiday. Normally my husband and I never go into any airport bar as usually we pick up our car from our arrival airport however because there was 6 of us we had a bus arrangement and due to flight being delayed for over 3 hours thought we would go and have a drink at the bar. Never again 3 pints of lager 2 fantas and a small bottle of water cost Â£49. We were utterly shocked but should have realised the moment we entered the bar as there were only another couple of people there. The prices at the fast food outlets was also extortionate. We had the foresight to take sandwiches and soft drinks with us although had to drink liquids before customs ( wish we had had similar foresight for the airport bar!). The airport was also very stuffy hardly any aircon. I felt so sorry for parents with small children as they would have definitely needed drinks. Also agree with reviews regarding lack of seating downstairs. The airport authorities really need to sort this out. If we go back to Turkey again we will take food and drink and will not go through customs until the last minute. Lovely airport totally spoiled by rip off prices!,1,0
dalaman-airport,T Brophy,United Kingdom,The main gripe about the airport is the prices. The airport is clean air conditioned with decent toilet facilities. Take food with you. The authorities have stopped drinks going in so that is a problem. Be prepared know what to expect and should not be a problem.,4,0
dalaman-airport,L Morris,United Kingdom,I wish I had read these comments before my return from Dalaman Airport we are still reeling at the price for 2 pints TL35. How can that be justified. Such a disappointed end to a lovely holiday.,2,0
dalaman-airport,Andy Wilson,United Kingdom,Still the same ridiculous prices for food or something to drink - we were delayed for 6 hours and the security staff tried to stop us going back outside for a cigarette - while they were smoking in front of us! Turkish authorities REALLY need to clamp down on the concessions here - the airport is famous worldwide for rip off prices the infrastructure is pretty bad as well.,2,0
dalaman-airport,James Wilkinson,United Kingdom,It's all been said before - extortionate pricing for food and drinks newspapers too. On the way in the visa official forgot my £10 change too. All rather sad really.,1,0
dalaman-airport,Ian Street,United Kingdom,Just back from Turkey today and still reeling from the extortionate prices being charged at Dalaman Airport. What struck me is the stupidity and short sightedness of the management  if they cut their prices by a third they would sell four times as much. Where else can you find McDonalds KFC and Burger King outlets without queues actually with the exception of the absolutely desperate no customers at all? The airlines must love it I have never seen so much food sold on a flight. Refusing to pay the bar prices we bought a nice bottle of red in the duty free shop (£8) and managed to persuade a bar tender to open it for us!,1,0
dalaman-airport,J Roberts,United Kingdom,We were disgusted with the prices being charged for very mundane fast food. Whilst we looked at the menu we noticed that there was no queue (a first for MacDonalds) and a large number of people having seen the prices at the tills walked away. Finally the method of paying £10.00 in cash for a bit of paper stuck into our passport which purports to be a visa on arrival feels a bit like a bribe to let us in. If this really is a charge for a visa then add it to the ticket price. Also seriously consider whether young children should be subject to this charge.,3,0
dalaman-airport,L Adams,United Kingdom,There is a restriction on taking liquids through customs. This is when you go through passport control not when you first enter the airport and have to have your luggage scanned - you are fine to take liquids beyond that point just not through to the other side of passport control. Fine to take sandwiches etc just not drinks - so had to pay 5 lira for a 500 ml bottle of water. Noticed this time that there is even less seating than there was at the beginning of the season which means that if you want a seat you have to sit in the food court areas. We did this and kept getting asked if we were going to buy anything. Take something to eat with you but you just have to grin and bear it to pay the price for a drink if you are desperate.,2,0
dalaman-airport,Stan Marsh,United Kingdom,Was there today and will never visit Turkey through this zoo of an airport again. Queue for this queue for that - surly staff and as for the lack of seating on the ground floor forcing you to the first floor to be faced with stupidly high prices for essential food and drink items. Managers of this facility hang your heads in shame!!,1,0
dalaman-airport,P Wright,United Kingdom,We just flew back from Dalaman airport and although we had 2 hours to kill we refused pay their ridiculously high prices for food and drink. There are several high street companies ie MDs Burger King but they all charge these high prices - it must be price fixing or bordering on some illegal practice. Coffee is around £4.50 and even a bottle of water will cost around Â£4. Very few people were buying and it's leave visitors with a bad feeling of the place so it makes you wonder what their game is.,2,0
dalaman-airport,Gillian Tarbun,United Kingdom,Have been going to Turkey for 15 years and it's a shame that the last memory of a wonderful country is spoiled by such a rip off at the airport. Food and drink prices are sky high. My advice would be to take food and drink with you. There is no restriction in place at the moment for taking water etc through customs. There is plenty of seating in the food halls and I have never been had any problems when eating food not bought there. The airport is stuffy and dim and the public announcement system is impossible to understand.,3,0
dalaman-airport,M Wooding,United Kingdom,Arrivals perfect but passport control were very rude - just throw your passport at you then take a tenner off you. Way home was horrendous we had about 1-2 hour delay we had to sit on the floor as poor seating. Everything there was a rip of didn't even bother going in the shops as read previous reviews saying rip off.,4,0
dalaman-airport,T Nicholls,United Kingdom,What an absolute disgrace! I got fleeced 40 lire (£18) for two beers and a small tin of pringles! Nowhere to sit poorly lit escalators designed to try and keep you spending (by being laid out the wrong way round) the whole place is a complete living nightmare made worst when you are delayed (which is a near certainty).,1,0
dalaman-airport,Hugh Williams,United Kingdom,"I agree with all the previous comments about the rip-off prices at this airport. Last year Burger King landside wanted TL28 for a bacon double cheeseburger - not the meal just the sandwich! This year (2009) that BK was closed. Airside the rip-off continues. A cheeseburger at McDonalds is around Â£10 and Â£40 for a family of four would be about average. The airport is new and clean. There is very little seating except in the food areas. It is easy to get to the food areas up an escalator but there is no ""down"" escalator nearby. to get back to the ground floor and the gates involves a long walk to the othere end of the terminal and back. Poor design!",2,0
dalaman-airport,R Wyld,United Kingdom,"I agree with all that has been said about the extortionate prices that passengers are expected to pay for very ordinary food and drink at this airport. I was asked to pay 46 lira for 3 can of coke and a packet of Pringles. This whole pricing issue is a shame because my experience in Turkey was generally of very reasonable prices . I was left with such a ""sour taste"" because we had a very long wait at the airport and would have like a decent meal at an acceptable price. Even a burger king burger was 26 lira. Turkey should take notice that on this basis alone I would veto their application for EU membership",1,0
dalaman-airport,B Tappy,United Kingdom,Do not think I am adding anything new here but just to underline what everybody else has said. If you are unfortunate to get stuck at Dalaman Airport like we were (for 13 hours) make sure you have a credit card with you to pay for your food and drink. 6 of us needed to eat something. KFC. Macdonalds Pizza Express etc all roughly the same price - GBP 10 per head! There were 6 of us we bought 6 meals at KFC and it cost TL135 = GBP60.00. Amazing how they can get away with it.,2,0
dalaman-airport,Martin Holroyd,United Kingdom,Same comment as everyone else. Outrageous prices limited seating despite being a new airport it was dull. The staff resent being there and all in all a poor end to a fantastic holiday. To get a seat we went into the pub at the end for a meal and drink. Same comment really outrageous prices and the staff seemed more intent on shouting across the bar to each other than serving their customers. Food in the bar was disgraceful particularly as we had been used to fabulous food in Kalkan. I'll be making sure any friends of mine going there don't get caught out like we did. The Airport authorities should be ashamed of themselves.,1,0
dalaman-airport,Alison Hemming,United Kingdom,I agree totally with all the comments people have submitted to this site - having experienced in the past severe delays at Dalaman (aircraft problems) - I expect by now we holidaymakers have paid off the national debt of Turkey. Having been an ill-fated passenger of XL last year my colleague and I were faced with a six hour wait at the airport before we were flown home. We had not yet checked in so discovered the cafe in the coach park - whilst not cheap we whiled away many hours at half the cost of being inside the terminal.,2,0
dalaman-airport,J Maynard,,"Staff speak very poor English; not the ideal situation when going through security - especially when they seem frustrated at you for their lapse in communication and not yours. Staff generally miserable customer service poor - at passport check in I had my passport snatched and chucked back at me was stripped of £10 for a visa which nobody had been warned about and was completely disregarded throughout the entire process. This in combination with a dull concrete roofing and dim lighting makes for a somewhat depressing experience. Prices are ridiculous. The 'cool zone' shop was selling a normal pack of pringles for £10 when I asked ""You think that's cool"" whilst referencing the shop name and pointing at the packet was abruptly threatened with a call to the police - for simply questioning the price of a beverage that shouldn't have been more than £1.50. This was made somewhat worse when either parents were forced to empty their pockets to feed or water a young child (£4.00 / 500ml bottle of water) or they simply went without for which Turkish authorities in the airport should be utterly ashamed. This pricing left a sour taste in my mouth as the holiday came to a close - and very effectively summed up Turkey's financially taxing culture hidden charges and nothing - for free culture - which even bites when you've paid the admission fees. The whole experience made me realise how good Gatwick airport really is.",1,0
dalaman-airport,J Ahmad,,Yes the airport is very expensive it was 25 TL for a meal at Kentucky Friend Chicken or MacDonalds very expensive. We knew about this and still ended up buying rolls and drinks which for 4 rolls and drinks worked out not as expensive but still not cheap. You can take bottled water through Customs so buy it before you get to the airport. Also a good point to let you know which a friend did me is you have to pay a £10.00 english note for each passenger to get into the country so take it with you as its a pest when you get there.b The airport is very clean and cool and the toilets were clean so it was fine just don't eat there.,4,0
dalaman-airport,C Ardimento,,Cannot agree more that the prices of refreshments in Turkish airports are far too high and likely to leave a bad taste in any traveller's mouth!,3,0
dalaman-airport,Pauline Norton,,Pity the first time visitor to Turkey - this is their last memory of a beautiful country! The airport practice of being a complete rip off remains. 8TL (£3+) for a can of pop bearing in mind that they practice a liquid restriction (though we saw evidence to belie this) what kind of profit is this airport now making? Check-in staff were friendly but just not quick enough. The airport was unbearably hot. Entrance scanner staff must have felt that they needed something to do as I was asked to unpack a camcorder and produce passports. Duty Free prices are all in Euros so you can bet your life that you are being fleeced due to a dynamic currency conversion. Having paid more than double UK service station prices for food before we avoided the food court. Smoking restrictions are in place but we couldnt face the journey through the scanners a 2nd time round. A modern building with the capability of being outstanding - what a shame it isn't put to use!,1,0
dalaman-airport,Paul Nolan,,Dalaman airport so expensive - Mcdonalds Burger £12 Crisps £4 Coffee £4 KFC bucket £37 etc. Bottle of Water £4. Beware of the trolley scam They offer a trolley at the main glass door as you get out of your taxi and charge you £1 (2TL) for a 20 yard walk to the check in. Turkey should be ashamed of this rip off. The people and culture is fantastic. There is a VIP lounge called a CIP goodness knows what they charge no surprise there were no people using it. So take drinks and food as you will get delayed in the summer and £50 for 4 burgers is hard to swallow !,1,0
dalaman-airport,P MacLeod,,For a new airport it is very disappointing. The check in and security is OK but once you are in the departure lounge it is really awful. The food outlets are horrendously expensive (take sandwiches is my advice). But most importantly there are hardly any seats in the whole departure lounge. If you dont want to go into the restaurants (and only a very rich or mad person would do this) you have to sit on the marble floor until your flight is called.,1,0
dalaman-airport,Rob Clark,,Disgusting. No other word for it. Food and drink prices are nothing short of extortion and those interested in attracting tourism to Turkey should do something about it. Airport dark and dingy. Very uncomfortable and worst of all its a new. The best thing about this place is the lost and found place. We left our camera on the plane by accident and they were very good at getting it sorted out for us. As an experience though it definitely the worst of the worst. Best avoided if you can.,1,0
dalaman-airport,Bob Wilson,,A lovely airport with friendly staff just a great pity management have decided to fleece parting tourists after what was possibly a very enjoyable Turkish holiday experience. Whether you have a coffee a coke a beer or a packet of crisps everything costs £4! Our group had 4 coffee's = £16 ridiculous! We saw many embarassed and obviously thirsty families having to turn down refreshments which they had ordered but did not have the money left to pay for. Just pray you never have a lengthy delay of your flight at Dalaman Airport! Tip - there appears to not be a 100ml restriction (as there is in the UK) at security so make sure you take plenty liquid in with you. Because of this we have given what is otherwise an excellent airport one star.,1,0
dalian-airport,Nick Fortuna,,Arrived in the domestic section in the evening. Bags out quickly no matching of the bag-tag to the baggage receipt as can be the case in other airports. Left on the international side the following morning. Check-in reasonably quick. No waiting for passport control. Security check also quick though followed up by a pat-down. Once airside the food options are limited. The small smoky cafe served very expensive filter coffee at 38RMB (espresso machine broken) but the Udon noodles at 40RMB were excellent. Shopping limited. The Terminal is bright nice and airy though fairly small - only five gates in the international section. When taxiing you get a nice view of the military airport the closest foreigners will get to seeing chinese airforce planes.,3,0
dalian-airport,Y Leung,,Excellent airport with ample space and good architecture. Check-in very efficient. Immigration officers very friendly because now there is a small machine on the left side with which you can evaluate the service of service of the officer from poor to excellent in 5 grades. It is true that it doubles as a military airport but you could have a rare sight of military jets standing nearby.,4,0
dalian-airport,Chris Carroll,,Dalian Airport is ok. It is a large “new” terminal now with both the old and new buildings not exactly seamlessly combined. Check in for both domestic and international flights is straight forward. Look at the departure board and go to the appropriate window. Security is also easy. Don’t put your ticket away as they need to see it along with your passport and boarding pass. Delays are common due to the bad weather in the area- seems to me they built the airport in the foggiest part of the city. High winds also cause problems and the fact the civil airport doubles as a military base means there is no prize for guessing who gets priority. Don’t go there hungry or you will have to pay high prices for average Chinese or Korean food. The usual snack shops are plentiful but expect to pay for it. Toilets are bearable but (as with all toilets in China) don’t forget to take some paper from the dispenser near the wash area as there is none provided in the individuals cubicles. I guess they think you will steal it if they leave you alone with it long enough. Despite the smoking rooms provided Chinese still insist on smoking in the toilets so you have to put up with that discomfort too.,,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,L Suarez,United States,"The Airport which is going under a renovation program called the TRIP. But the airport is still very good, the SkyLink which connects the terminals is very clean and fast. The terminals are all up to date and my trip was pleasant.",10,1
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Doan Vo,United States,"We all expect lines at the airport to be long and tedious but when it gets confusing, your stress level will get the best of you. There were plenty of agents at the time to assist travelers yet every 10 feet had an agent checking your ticket yet when I get to the front of the line, we were left with no agents directing anyone through 1 of 6 lines. We were told to pick whichever line but wasn't informed that only half of them had working scanners therefore we must combine 2 lines into 1. What was the point? There was a drug dog that made it hard to squeeze through the line. Why couldn't they have the dog be outside of the line and sniff as everyone past it? Among all other airlines I've been to, (Chicago, New York, Tampa, Seattle) DFW has gotten worse over the years.",3,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,H Bourgeois,United States,"This airport is one that I refuse to fly into again. I was iffy about flying American Airlines to begin with, but knowing how their main hub of an airport is, I will never be visiting again. When landing in DFW for a layover, we had to taxi for 20 minutes because the control tower miscommunicated what gate we belonged to. Certain terminals are very nice with nice restaurants and waiting areas, while others are the underground tunnels of construction and uncleanliness. If coming through this airport be prepared to walk to anything and everything. The tram system is nice, however, the restaurants and gates can be up to a 10 minute walk away. When departing to our destination, we once more taxied on the runway for 20 minutes with a full flight and no little to no air-conditioning circulating as it was 95 degrees outside. When coming into Dallas for the layover returning home, seconds from touching down, we suddenly began to speed up and take off into the air. After 5-10 minutes after being in the air, the pilot came on the intercom and said the runway had traffic, and we are circling around. After the commotion of the flight, we waited around for our next fight, and never realized until 10 minutes prior to boarding that our gates changed to a completely different terminal. Lastly (there is no surprise to this one), we had to wait around 15 minutes for Dallas to transport half of the missing luggage from the other side of the airport. Needless to say, this was an awful experience. If you have the option of going to a different airport, take it, because, this airport/control tower needs to get it together, or they will be the next ones in the news headlines from airplane miscommunications.",1,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,V Bukat,China,"I would never imagine that baggage trolleys can be a paid luxury. 5 bucks for a trolley, and no trolleys whatsoever available inside security. In the worlds 4th busiest airport? This alone is enough to swear to never again fly through DFW. Nice eateries and shops did not make up for this ridiculous trolley policy. Dallas Fort Worth - no more.",1,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,A Gerlach,United Kingdom,If your flight uses this airport as a transfer option I would recommend you avoid like the plague! Choose another transfer airport even if the flight cost an extra £100 it will be worth every penny believe me. Security were on some kind of power trip and were very rude. Staff have absolutely no interest in anything you have to say unless it's to do with American Airlines. No direction signs at all for connecting flights you have to find your own way. Dallas Fort Worth you were our first impression of the USA - not a good impression.,,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Linda Neely,United States,We just had a terrible experience at DFW. My husband is handicapped and had requested wheelchair assistance. A wheelchair was waiting for us on the exit ramp but no wheelchair pusher. We two aged 70 and 84 had to manage ourselves and our carryon luggage through customs then pick up our checked baggage recheck it and go back through security to the Skyline and to our connecting gate having never been assisted by an official wheelchair pusher. We received random brief help from airport staff or other travelers. We had 3 hours from when our plane from MX landed and when our connecting flight left and we had no chance to use the restroom let alone get something to eat. When we were at TSA a worker commented that all the motorized cart drivers take break at the same time. That is why we had to go to the elevated train to travel the long distance to our next gate. What kind of customer service is this?,,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,David Maloof,United States,Arrived from Australia 20 February 2015 - worst part was waiting 20 minutes for our luggage to arrive. Overall entering the US took about 30 minutes from leaving the plane to completing Customs - not bad I suppose. Connecting flight to Atlanta was uneventful. Overall - DFW is a clean modern and very large airport.,9,1
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Mark Fergusson,United Kingdom,Arrived DFW Sat 17th January 2015 to find now you have choices. Being from the UK you can now go through ESTA channel. It takes about 2-3 mins to process your passport and answer some questions you get a slip of paper with your photo on it present that to a immigration officer then through to baggage. My bags were already waiting for me. Now there are three areas for customs. I entered the ESTA gate and through you go. For me no more than 10-15 mins from Immigration bags and Customs. Something that should have been done years ago has finally arrived. I have been coming to the US through DFW since 2000.,9,1
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Guy Senior,United Kingdom,I have now changed flights here on several occasions. It is best avoided - immigration is very slow security is dreadfully crowded/inefficient and the inter terminal transit is slow. Allow at least 3 hours for this. On the plus side BA/AA help with transfers when they can and there are lots of bars and restaurants if you miss your connecting flight (very likely).,1,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,C Jolly,United States,Five gate changes in two hours is unacceptable. Even with skylink I was exhausted. Had to catch skylink three times to keep up with the gate changes. It seems to me that it is just short of a controlled chaos. Someone there doesn't know what they are doing or is unable to control what is going on. Could not find anyone that could explain why there are so many gate changes. The flight assistants I talked with even thought it a joke. I will no time in the future go to DFW. Hard to accept this concept without even a simple explanation other than the gate changes DFW is pretty nice to go through.,3,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Joe Wilkins,United States,"I have arrived at DFW twice this year on flights coming back from Mexico City (once in January and once in December). I will only recount my second experience as the two were very similar. As opposed to other reviewers it appears that my flight was the only one arriving at that time. At least I didn't have a mob of angry fellow passengers to contend with. So when you get to passport control you will likely find a lady that smiles at you but doesn't do much of anything else. Once you figure out on your own how to use the machines for automated processing you'll get a piece of paper back from the machine. If your has an X on it that's bad. After finding the path out of the area where these machines are you will run into another lady whose native language is not English who if you ask for information will not be very helpful but if you try to go to the next step without getting her approval will tell you that you need to stop and wait for her (so damned if you do and damned if you don't). Since my little piece of paper had an X on it she pointed me towards the CBP counters (you have to wind your way in the opposite direction of how you came in). There was no one manning the counter she sent me to. Two more people arrived behind me. This lady and I could still see each other. I wanted to yell that there was no agent but was afraid of incurring the wrath of the best and brightest at Customs and Border Protection. Finally she came over to take a look. Just when I though she was about to take some kind of action all she did was yell at another woman working on the side for non-US citizens to take us ""somewhere else."" At this point finally an agent comes to man the counter. This gentleman was visibly fed up and not happy to be there. Maybe that was not such a bad thing because he clearly wanted to be done with me as soon as possible so he asked me a couple of questions didn't really wait for me to answer and waved me away. When I got to customs one agent only was working. There was another agent but he was just sitting there drinking water and watching the world go by. What bothers me is that almost a year later the experience was almost exactly the same. I'm not a fan of self- service passport control. Since humans will still need to be involved. What's the point? It probably only makes the CBP agents feel like they will be replaced by machines soon which will have a detrimental effect on their already less-than-stellar attitude. I forgot to mention both times there was a group of CBP agents talking and laughing in the back while travelers were trying to figure out what to do. So other than portraying Texas (and the US) in a terrible light I don't know what else the international arrivals process at DFW accomplishes. Again I'm only glad there weren't multiple flights arriving at the same time. However since I was sent to a queue no one was manning I still have to say the queuing was unacceptable. I will say the terminal was clean and looks modern but faced with everything else I will avoid DFW in the future (and consequently American Airlines as well).",,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Paul Swan,United Kingdom,"Have arrived at many US airports from international flights and this will be the first and last at Dallas. As the previous poster stated you will need at least 3 hours if you have a connection to make. Arrived after 10 hr flight from LHR and queued for the automated immigration terminal which is completely useless and irrelevant as you will then need to queue to see an immigration officer (circa 1 hour) collect bags and then on this occasion there was 1 officer for customs serving at least 3 international flights. Absolute chaos people panicking to make connections pushing in staff completely unhelpful with the standard ""you will be rebooked if you miss your connection"" took me 3 hours to get through. Why they don't have an express lane for people with connections is beyond me this is a hub isnt it?? I'd say 90% of people arriving Dallas is not their final destination. Never again I do wonder if the airlines have any say at this airport as there is an impact on their business as well. Love the states but never Dallas regards immigration for me.",,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,R Nelson,Australia,This would have had to have been my worst airport experience in 40yrs of International Travel. The staff co-ordinating the customs/border control area were hapless to say the least. There were only 3 desks out of 20-30 open. The airport would have been fully aware many hours in advance that 6 international flights were arriving in a similar time frame yet did nothing to alleviate the congestion. Many people missed their connections. DFW was recently lauded in local/national and international news for having the newest technology to process travellers faster. Well I can tell you that there a few airports (incl LAX) that are slower than DFW.,4,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,A Maidment,United Kingdom,After a long flight from LHR we were met with queues queues queues and unhelpful staff. Not the best impression for an international entry point for the USA. Do not even attempt to make a connecting flight with under 3 hours to spare. We had to queue 25 mins for an automatic passport check queued 20 minutes to see an immigration official then picked up luggage then queued again to someone to check our reason for visiting rechecked bags then had to clear security again (more queuing). On top of that the boarding cards from LHR didn't work so we were sent back to the American Airlines desk to be reissued new ones. Until we got to a gate staff were almost universally unhelpful (we were told by all that we had time to make our flight easily). American airlines blame the airport and take no responsibility for the systematic chaos and the airport staff apparently don't get any feedback that people are missing their flights because of the queuing. We missed our flight to SLC were put on standby for the next one late at night were booked onto one the following day in the end which was cancelled when we arrived at the airport the next morning. Not to mention last minute gate changes causing havoc and confusion for passengers. We did get to SLC in the end having been issued 5 separate lots of boarding cards. The journey back through DFW was much easier but from other reviews it sounds like our experience of entering at this airport is not unusual. Next time we will clear immigration stay overnight than tackle the internal flights the next day. Seems like the only sensible way with kids in tow.,,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Matthew Zhang,United States,We recently went from Lubbock to Miami via Dallas/Ft. Worth on American Airlines. Dallas is one of the best airports I've been to. The American Airlines Terminal A is very new very modern has lots of food and retail options and is very uncrowded. The half-circle layout of the terminal was excellent because it doesn't take forever to get from one gate to another. The Skylink stops are very convenient and there are 2-3 in each terminal it's a good way to get from one terminal to the other without taking a bus. Our flight to Miami was out of Terminal C another very modern very clean terminal. Overall a nice airport serving the Dallas area.,10,1
dallas-fort-worth-airport,K Dee,Australia,Excellent Airport though terrible for connecting flight or even entering Dallas for that matter. The facilities are great excellent choice of shopping and restaurants sky train is great and gives a good view of the airport. Customs is a nightmare if there are so many international flights arriving why isn't there staff at customs had to connect to a flight to Mexico and had 4 hours though it took close to 3 hours to get through customs so that I could pick up my luggage and then re-check in the luggage and go once more through security Why they don't have a section for people connecting to other flights is beyond me I was not interested in going out of the terminal then re-entering it. It is a disgrace and Authorities must make sure all customs booths have staff when international aircraft's arrive.,6,1
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Colin Gorman,United Kingdom,After 10 hr plus flight from LHR on a pretty full B773 was surprised that only 4 booths out of a long line of booths were open to be fair I got through in about 25 mins but I was right at the front of the queues but I really did feel sorry for the rest of the people behind me it wasn't going to be a fun experience for them-once passed INS/Customs there are loads of places to shop eat and drink prior to connecting with onward flight on the day I arrived DFW had a very bad storm (not their fault) which halted the rail so had to walk from D-A which took about 25mins-at all times all airport staff were approachable friendly and helpful.,7,1
dallas-fort-worth-airport,R Jenkins,United States,Transited here after many years of avoiding this airport and its main carrier (American). The good - it's better than it was in the past. Baggage claim is convenient to your arrival gate (for domestic). At some but not all gates you can avoid CNN which is an unfortunate mind numbing part of many US airports. They have a train system although it's no help if you arrive at Concourse D and depart from C (you'd have to do the whole loop or walk which is simpler). The bad - the food selection is awful. Many eateries but mostly the same chains over and over. Packaged snacks and drinks seem expensive even for an airport. Almost nothing is healthy other than pre-packaged salads (which may be a day or so old sandwiches can hang around longer judging from the pull dates). The departure screens seem few in number and randomly placed. Some areas are simply poorly designed. There is a section of the D concourse around the middle where it's easy to get lost despite the relatively small space.,5,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,K Martin,United Kingdom,Jan 2014 - arrived on delayed BA flight to be confronted with immigration queue that filled the arrivals hall and only 4 desks open. No help for those with connecting flights - ours missed. 1.5 hours to get to desk then further hour to get through baggage and further 40 mins to re-check flights. What a poor impression. Why oh why does the US not have a transit lounge for those with connecting flights. We await with trepidation our return flight to UK via Miami but will not willingly transit or even visit US again until this fiasco of a system is sorted out.,1,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Philip O'Connor,United Kingdom,Last week I flew through DFW from London Heathrow to make a connection to Puerto Vallarta Mexico. Having read reviews on this site I was somewhat apprehensive about making a 2.5 hour connection. I have to say my experience was extremely positive. US immigration took about 5 minutes security another 5 or 6 minutes. American Airlines had tagged my baggage straight through from the UK to Mexico so all I had to do was present a completed customs form but not my baggage. I had more than enough time to make my connection. And all in one terminal - D - a pleasant and well-organised terminal. This was a much better experience than transferring at Mexico City.,10,1
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Joan Smith,United States,Going through customs is a nightmare. No one there to provide directions so you have to figure out for yourself which lines to stand in. There's a computerized system when you get to the front of the line. From there you either go through another customs official search or a briefer process. Seems like a random process and again no one there to answer questions. People around me were getting worked up because they were missing their connections. We just let them cut to the front of the line so they could get through. It's embarrassing to have this be an entry point into the USA!,,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,D Thorpe,United Kingdom,Arrived on a delayed 10 hour British Airways flight from London. Upon landing had 2 hours to connect onto a flight to Kansas. Immigration took around 25 minutes to clear upon entering the baggage hall met with a snaking queue that wrapped itself around the baggage carousels. This whole process took around 50 minutes to clear customs. Rude unhelpful staff directing passengers. We then had to navigate the TSA transit security no smiles thank you's and surely rude staff and another delay of 35 minutes. We made our connecting flight with minutes to spare tired and totally stressed out. Will totally avoid this shambles of an airport again if on a connecting flight.,2,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Peggy Baden,United States,It seems that the airport was more efficient several months ago than present date. Early in summer baggage claim was very efficient as was the car toll. At present the new car toll has been a mess from gates not working to very narrow driving areas going into the gate to overcharging. Personally I haven't been overcharged. I was bragging about the efficiency of the airport from how passengers can be delivered right to their departure gate however this is no longer true if leaving from terminal E. Also bragged about baggage wait being very short however just picked up my husband and it took 55 minutes from when he landed to getting baggage. I'm not certain what has changed but it appears it isn't for the best. So sorry to have to report this.,6,1
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Bill Walker,Australia,Travelled through Dallas twice in the last 18 months. Worst queues I have ever experienced. Last year following the cancellation of 200 flights due to bad weather I spent 10 hours standing in 3 queues to get re-ticketed. Last month I travelled with 4 hour lay over between flights and needed every minute as immigration was 1.5 hours and the queue to exit with baggage was another 1.5 hours. I will never travel through Dallas again unless there is no other choice.,,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,A Wenzel,Switzerland,Immigration very poor 3 hrs in June this time even 5 hrs. 4 counters open for several hundred passengers that is no customer service. Who are the bunch of people that stand around there wearing important badges and faces doing nothing? Avoid this immigration or better the entire AP.,,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Bob Motto,United Kingdom,Arrived in DFW from LHR with a connection to SDF what a nightmare it took over 2.5 hours to clear immigration and then another 45 mins to get through customs with another 35 mins to get through security again. Avoid DFW at all cost if you have to transit in the us! They have 60 booths for immigration when I went through they only had 3 open for non US Residents which is not a great impression when arriving into the US. So many people were getting very angry about missing their connecting flights and the people on duty to assist with passengers who had tight connections spent most of their time talking to each other! I would really have thought that after building a new international terminal at DFW they would ensure that the passenger experience would be a great experience but I am sorry to say that DFW is far from it. The staff in immigration are rude and have a lot of attitude the airlines are aware of the situation when you speak to staff but they say there is nothing they can do about it. So if you want a stress free entry point into the US do not use DFW and avoid it at all costs. Needless to say I made my connection with ten mins and they were boarding the flight as I arrived at the gate.,,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,T Kimberley,United Kingdom,On arrival the airport seemed unlike many other American airports - clean and tidy and judging by other reviews we seem to have done well and got through immigration in an hour plus customs was fairly quick as well. On the way home being British it always amuses us that unlike European airports where the terminal is a really shopping mall with an airport attached American airports are really a food court with an airport attached! To sum up there plenty of places to eat.,7,1
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Wendy Hoyle,United Kingdom,I changed planes here yesterday after a holiday in Costa Rica. It was a complete nightmare. We had a 3 hour layover period and only just made the flight back to Heathrow. The queues for Customs and immigration were ridiculous. Surely they could provide a fast track for people with connecting flights! I will never change planes in the US ever again and would probably not consider visiting the USA due to the airports. We changed in Miami on the way out and passports took longer although Customs was quicker.,,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Terry Hughes,Australia,Landed from Brisbane on Qantas with an overnight stay in the airport Hyatt en route to Montego Bay Jamaica. Immigration queues were poorly managed and very understaffed. It took two hours to clear immigration and another hour to exit the baggage and customs hall. Checking in the next morning (business class) took 90minutes. I changed my flights on the way back through Dallas because I realized my original connection time of just over two hours was impossible. There is no international sterile zone. So arriving from Jamaica required clearing immigration customs collecting bags re-checking and re-entering security. Allow 4 hours. LAX for all its flaws is better.,1,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Elizabeth Harley,United Kingdom,Frequently travel to DFW from the UK nearly always arrive after a 10 hour flight having already been up for at least 5 hours prior to the flight. Very tired and then met by long immigration queues. They have lots of booths but usually only around 6-8 staff covering them surely they know the periods when lots of flights are arriving at once and can have staff to cover. My daughter at this present moment is stuck in such a queue not even into the immigration hall having already been up for 17 hours will not be through immigrations for another 2/3 hours and then has a 2 hour drive on her own with a very cranky 2 year old. Not good enough DFW - used to be a pleasant experience - not any more!,2,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,M Achtman,United Kingdom,2 hours to get through customs after a 10 hour flight and that was just normal procedure without getting searched etc. Many people in the queue distraught about missing their connecting flights but all were told not to worry they could rebook so obviously this type of delay is unexceptional/routine.,,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,S Ares,United Kingdom,3 hour stop over and not a hope of catching the one flight to Fort Myers. Totally unresponsive staff resulted in a 20 hour wait for the next flight. We have 7 of us doing the same in August and we are dreading it.,,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,T McDowell,United States,If you are making a connection from an international flight allow at least 3 hrs to catch your next flight. It takes around 60-90 min for immigration alone. They have 8 or 10 booths but I have never seen more than 4 open. Then another 30-60 min to get your luggage back through to your connection. My last lay over there was 3.5 hrs and I almost missed my flight and my luggage did not make the connection. Huge airport that is very very understaffed all of the time. The staff they do have is mostly clueless so if you need advice I recommend asking one of the Airline Representatives who are much more friendly and helpful. If you need a rest break catch one before the departure gates the ones there are usually completely trashed and disgusting. One positive is the Tram is nice but they need it as it is a very long way between gates.,2,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,A Morales,Mexico,2 hrs to go through immigration and I was in transit. There were 60 booths and only 9 had agents. Had to go through customs and security check only to get back into the terminal. I thought LAX was bad but this is ridiculous.,1,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,J Galippo,United States,Stayed at the Hyatt in Terminal D specifically to make our 5.15 am flight only problem is they offer no terminal OR SKYLINK until 4.30am even though a kind service personnel called for a bus we missed our flight. No sense staying at the Hyatt in terminal D if you've got an early flight out of any terminal except D.,2,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,P Jenkins,Australia,Flew into DFW from Sydney last month on a Qantas 747 with the intentions of comparing it to the other common gateway for similar travels Los Angeles International which I had used on the previous 4 trips across the Pacific. The perceived advantage that Dallas has over LAX is that it places travellers like me geographically closer to my final destination of New York City. After weighing all of the positives and negatives this is the only real edge that I experienced. Immigration took longer at Dallas than any of my prior trips through LAX. DFW had plenty of immigration lanes but unfortunately a very large percentage were closed. My craft certainly was not the only international jumbo on the ground at the time either. People sometimes complain about the supposed hassles of connecting at LAX but again the process took longer at DFW than it ever had at LAX for me. Yes you have to exit and then re-enter the terminal after the international flight here just as you do in Los Angeles. Maybe Dallas' airport light rail is more comfortable and easier with luggage than the internal bus system that Los Angeles has but not really enough to sway me. The real disadvantage for now is the fact that DFW does not have the physical infrastructure to handle the large A380 Airbus which is a leap above the Boeing 747 in many aspects. Until that changes it is really back to LAX for my travels.,6,1
dallas-fort-worth-airport,R Maccuswell,United States,Huge airport but very easy to get around. Skytram is inside security so 10 minutes or so to get from the two most distanced terminals. I switched from C to A so took all of 4 minutes once tram arrived. Easy to get to well marked. It is a very busy airport but lots of services. Fairly clean consider how busy. Too bad LA or NYC airports don't follow this example.,8,1
dallas-fort-worth-airport,L Lehnert,Mexico,This airport is absolutely enormous. It is very far from one terminal to the next. Both the monorail system (Skytrain) and the Terminal Link bus convey passengers to the different terminals. The terminals themselves are very nice and modern. Security screening involved lengthy lines although passengers in wheelchairs get priority. Unfortunately all the food outlets are airside so it is necessary to go through security screening before getting something to eat or if you are exiting the terminal you must get your food before you leave the airside area and take it out with you. Unlike airports in Asia there are no smoking kiosks near the gates; the smoking areas are outside the terminals. Immigration is in a huge room which was very crowded when I entered. There was a customs officer pre-screening passengers entering the immigration section. Customs itself was smooth and non-eventful. Baggage claim went fairly quickly despite the number of passengers arriving at the same time that I did. Overall I was impressed with the system at this airport and would not hesitate to fly through here again.,10,1
dallas-fort-worth-airport,S King,Brazil,While a lot of walking was involved form our plane to Immigration once we got to the agents the process went very quickly. Almost no wait. Customs quick too. Modern American Airlines Admirals Club. Overall a spacious airport. Signage for the tram can be a bit confusing (when we later landed at Terminal C it didn't really seem to matter which tram we took to the international terminal) but overall a good airport. It does apparently experience weather delays at least in the summer. The night before we arrived flights were delayed for hours by thunderstorms.,8,1
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Arthur MacKinnon,United States,DFW has 5 terminals ABCD and E. D Terminal is the international terminal is very nice and has many shops and eating establishments parking for terminal D is great with that said ABC and E are not very nice small ales and sitting areas with very few power outlets for travels. The seating itself is old and stained. The most frustrating is the parking the multi level parking garages have no elevators so if you park in the upper levels you must carry your luggage up and down very narrow stairs. Security lines are often long and no on seems to be in hurry. Driving to the airport is offend very congestive and difficult to get in or out areas of the airport. I live in the Dallas area and travel out of this airport almost every week.,3,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,G Kovoor,India,"Arrived from Los Cabo to DFW and had a 2 hour lay-over before my American Airlines Connection to New York LGA. First of all we were greeted by a long winding line at the immigration counter where there were just 6 officers! The lines moved slowly and painfully. I tried to persuade security officers to let me go ahead in the line but was met with a firm ""There are plenty of flights to New York it is ok to miss this one! You are ok!"" I have been to several immigration counters - DFW was the worst! After 90 minutes to finally clear immigration and another 10 minutes to clear customs we rushed to the AA boarding gate. Before we could get anywhere close to our gate we had to go through a security and body scan. Another painful 55 minutes followed. I could see many other passengers frantic and anxious in the line. I would make it at least 15 passengers within earshot in the line who had already missed their connections.",1,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,L Halson,Australia,This was a great airport from an Australian perspective. Everything was clean and the mono rail was fantastic. There was plenty of shopping and food outlets. The main newer terminal is fantastic.,10,1
dallas-fort-worth-airport,J Rearden,United States,If it was possible to give negative points for this airport I would do it. I arrived from Cancun on Tuesday April 24th with a 3.5 hour layover until my connecting flight. I thought I had plenty of time to make that flight until I had to wait over 2 hours in the immigration line another 30 minutes in customs line and 45 minutes in security line - not to mention the 10 minutes it took to get from Terminal D to Terminal C on the tram. There were approximately 1000 people in the immigration line (that's just US citizen/residents line) and a grand total of 4 people working the immigration booths as well as only 1 security line. Government inefficiency at its best. Suffice it to say I will never fly through DFW again.,2,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Pierre Home-Douglas,Canada,I have never dealt with the kind of ridiculous delays that I experienced at DFW last Wednesday April 11. I arrived from Guadalajara at 10 am. I got to the customs/immigration line a few minutes later and waited 90 minutes to get through customs. After that I waited another 15 minutes to hand in my card to another customs official. In all it took me 2 hours to go from one gate in Terminal D to another gate about 50 yards away.,2,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Sean Symon,United States,Very impressed with this airport. Connections are made extremely easy by the sky link tram system which connects all terminals and runs every 3 mins or so. Since DFW has seven runways there were no delays due to runway congestion. My only complaint was the lack of aesthetic appeal in A/C terminals. Terminal D on the other hand was very nice.,9,1
dallas-fort-worth-airport,E Mabley,United States,The terminal design is such that you can pass from gate to kerb in under 5 minutes upon arrival and security queues tend to be short and manageable upon departure. American dominates the airport and takes up 4 terminals - if you're making a connection between A/C and B/D (on opposite sides of the central highway) it can take a while because the SkyTrain is slow and makes many stops. Terminal D was recently renovated and is quite smart but A B and C are older and could use a refurb. Dining options are outstanding in D but mediocre in A B and C. For whatever reason the airport operators crank up the aircon at all hours and the terminals feel unnecessarily cold. The rental car facility is about 2.5 miles off site but shuttles are frequent.,8,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,A Chang,Taiwan,While it cannot compare to most foreign hubs DFW is a functional airport by American standards. Amenities are on par with other large US hubs but security checks rarely take more than 15 mins of queuing. Customs/Immigration is probably the fastest I have experienced in the US and although int'l transfer passengers must exit the secure area and undergo an additional security check this is not really different from any other US airport. Gate-to-gate transfers can be quite a trek given the size of the airport but are quite simple if your gate is closer to a Skytrain entrance. The biggest gripe is the fact that the baggage system is slow and outdated. Unless you are flying into the newer terminal D expect to wait about 30 minutes before you will see your bag.,4,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,T Ha,United States,Of many airports I have slept in overnight due to cancelled flights or early morning flight DFW is the only one I know that passes out cots to passengers who are sleeping at the airport! They pass out blankets and cots. Around 1000pm various airport staff roam the airport with their electric carts passing out these cots and blankets to anyone who wants one. At Narita airport in Japan they actually gather passengers to a secured area of the airport check their papers and then turn off the lights. Although Narita airport doesn't pass out blankets and cots the area where they cordon off passengers have seats that you can stretch out on.,4,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,J Peterson,United States,DFW is a very nice airport with great maintenance and cleanliness. The newer International D- Terminal is very nice and modern. Also the Skytrain is very convenient and useful.,4,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,G Senior,United Kingdom,Little short of a shambles recently. Took over 90 minutes to get a BA 747 through immigration which meant that getting a connecting flight was touch and go. What made it a lot worse was that connecting passengers do not stay in a secure area but have to go through security again. On top of this the air con was so poor that the terminals were unpleasantly warm.,2,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,S DePenning,,Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport is very large and clean airport. Its overall aesthetic appeal puts it in contrast to say Chicago O'Hare International. Plan sufficient time for connections! This airport is on the list of the world's busiest the airport complex is massive and the last problem you want to have when travelling is to miss a flight. There is however a tram system that is helpful.,4,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,S Michaelson,,"A pleasant change from LAX and San Diego my home airports. Arrived in transit and had to spend two hours here. As I was looking at a large directory sign I was approached by a very nice lady who wore a tag identifying her as an ""ambassador"" of the airport. She handed me a small map and directory and explained the skylink a free train system the airport has to take you from one terminal to another. It is clearly marked and had signs specifying what terminal the train took you to. The airport was clean had plenty of shops and restaurants and was well organized. I didn't have to pick up baggage or go through customs but the airport itself is one of the better ones I've been in.",5,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,R Bashyam,,DFW airport is decent in terms of check in security access etc but one has to pay to just even drop someone. The cart costs $3 while it is free in 3rd world countries like India. So is the wifi which is free at most Indian airports but not available for free at DFW airport. There is not much to eat for people who drop off passengers except at Terminal D. Not many international flights there as well.,3,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,P McCorkle,,Transportation around the airport was terrible. For that reason alone I prefer to avoid Dallas FW but will go through it if the only other option is LAX. Other than transport it's a pretty average airport for the US. Security and Customs are subpar but not unbearable. The level of service is generally substandard as well.,3,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,G Maltman,,Last October 2008 we came through Immigration in transit for LHR from Mexico as we were British (foreigners) our queue was huge it took 3 hours to get through! We were lucky we did not miss our next flight but a whole lot of people did! Nightmare - they need more officers for the foreigners - Americans fly through in a breeze I must add. However as an Airport fantastic - just got to help people through Immigration - it is only because of a lack of staff!,5,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,J Martin,,US Immigration and Customs are efficient and normally quite friendly. Airport security is thorough but friendly and efficient as well. Terminal transfers via the overhead train system inside security is wonderfully easy. I have gotten stuck at DFW for hours at a time because of cancelled flights on several occasions and there is no better place to be. In Terminal D there are ample restaurants both fast food and real food which are quick and good. There is lots of shopping and things to do while making time. No free wireless internet though just paid via T-Mobile. Other terminals also have decent restaurants and shopping but you can always take the train to terminal D if time permits. Baggage claim and ground transportation are a breeze as is parking if you have to drive there to pick somebody up. Check in is just as easy and convenient because of the terminal layout.,5,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,M Mangham,,Went through DFW in and out on our travel from LHR to SJO and were very impressed by the speed and politeness of immigration the efficiency of the security staff and terminal D itself. It did not take more than 25 minutes from immigration luggage reclaim luggage check-in for our next flight and security to the departure lounge. Terminal D is very clean with plenty of seats shops and restaurants. Wifi was not working everywhere though. experience.,5,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Cristiano Miro,,I connected in DFW on my way from FLL to SNA on AA. The AA terminal felt like a very upscale mall. Floor to ceiling windows with plenty of natural light. Beautiful polished marble floors. Modern super-functional layout with excellent signage. Real plants (at least they looked like it) hanging out of the second floor. Many quality shopping and eating venues; with the restrooms being actually clean and all the staff I encountered friendly and informative.,5,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,N Junzo,,Had been to DFW (from GRU on AA) twice in the past 12 months - and I consider it my best airport experience in the Americas. On both oCcasions I took no longer than 20 min from the moment the plane touched the gate until I passed through customs on terminal D. Immigration queues processed very quickly as well. The last time I had less than 40 min for a connecting flight on terminal C and thanks to the very efficient inter-terminal tranportation (Skylink with trains arriving every 2 minutes) I safely made it. The new terminal D is modern and has many alternatives for eating and shopping inside security.,4,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,G Marsh,,Flew in and out of DFW. Immigration queues a nightmare one member of security staff was rude and unhelpful not a nice welcome to the USA for anyone.By time we cleared these two hurdles we had five minutes to board our ongoing flight and had to run like mad to get to the departure gate in another terminal. Airport train system was good efficient and very rapid. The airport is quite comfortable very spacious and a good variety of restaurants. We had a five hour layover on our return and eventually waited at our gate only to find they had changed the gate without informing anyone!,4,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Matt Ray,,DFW is a great place to wait out an airport delay as often happens. There are good restaurants there good shopping huge terminals to get a little walking exercise and those great massage chairs that I never pass up using. I use this airport very frequently and love it. It's a bit far out of Dallas and the traffic is abominable out there but the airport itself can hardly be faulted.,4,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,James McCoy,,"I've connected through DFW on 12 separate flights and have never had a problem getting from terminal to terminal. Yes it would be great if I arrived at Gate A5 and departed at Gate A6 every time (this actually happened to me once!) but that's not a reasonable expectation at any airport. The SkyTrain takes me where I need to go in an acceptable amount of time and with a minimal amount of fuss. I like the simple and logical layout of DFW with gates on the outside and shops restrooms and restaurants on the inside of each semicircle-shaped terminal. To those who say that ""DFW has the worst layout of any airport"" I would add ""...except for all the other airports at which I've connected"". Now if they would only make a place for smokers inside security.",,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Ron Kuhlmann,,"Flew in to the new international terminal and was impressed with its size and facilities - well it is Texas. The decor was a bit bland but that's not the purpose of the facility. The real kicker was in the security clearance for the domestic leg. There was a mother with two small children--an infant in meltdown mode and a two year old who was doing his best after flying overnight. The gatekeeper was a sour looking woman who seemed most delighted by having the authority to say ""no"". The mom in all the confusion had not removed her shoes and was sent back to rectify this open challenge to the rules. She went through with the baby and Little Miss Sunshine noted that the boy had both shoes and a sweater on! Her response was two-fold first she prohibited mom from going back to help and responded to the child by telling him that mommy was going to leave him unless he played by the rules. There was not a person in line who was not ready to tackle her and beat her senseless but that is not the best approach these days. Finally a decidely non Latino TSA male came over squatted down and spoke at length to the child in Spanish. Big credits for his help. But overall it was ""security"" at its most absurd. Transfer to Terminal A on SkyLink was fine after that and the rest of the time there was ordinary airport time.",,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Pam McCoy,,Because of the way DFW is set and because the airport is so sprawling it is an absolute necessity know the arrival gate when picking someone up. Without that you are lost. We are new to Dallas and it is almost impossible to get an accurate gate designation. I must leave in 30 minutes to pick up my party - and their flight arrival info isn't yet posted on the airport website. In light of the way the airport is set up DFW must do a better job of informing patrons of arrival gates - and not 10 minutes before the flight lands! It sucks right now.,,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Mike Smaile,,Flew through DFW last week and due to inclement weather I had to spend the night at the airport. If you're in this situation look for the kids play areas in the middle of Terminals B and C. They have long couches that you can really stretch out on; much more comfortable than the gate area chairs!,,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Andy Levy,,I've connected at DFW on AA twice in the past week and I must admit that my opinions about DFW have improved. It appears that AA now has enough elbow room with operations in terminals A B C and D... so the terminals themselves are not the jam-packed cattle pens they used to be. Skylink is an improvement over the older Airtrans people-mover system. Interior signage and aesthetics are okay not great. I noticed that many of the digital clocks have been removed so one can't tell with a glance while walking down the concourse what time it is... but that's a minor point.,,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Juan Fernandez,,This is my hometown airport. It's great to fly out of and fine to fly back into as a final destination. But I cannot imagine have to change planes here even with the Skylink. Real hassle. On the upside the new terminal D is very very cool and the staff is extremely nice and helpful. (They have volunteers in cowboy hats to welcome you and offer help and directions.) The restaurants and shops are reasonably priced and good quality.,,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Mark Evans,,"Never thought I'd write these words but I had a very agreeable TSA experience when transiting DFW the other week. Having along with a herd of fellow PAX deposited my hand baggage items + shoes on the conveyor for scanning I then filed through the x-ray brandishing my boarding pass and photo ID. The man checking these engaged in pleasant chat with everyone who passed through - ""How are you doing Sir/Madam?"" and commented on our destinations - ""Tampa Florida Sir? Nice place..."" OK so it was a bit of an charade but I welcomed the injection of a bit of humanity to took the sting out of a normally stressful experience. So has the DFW example of the TSA human touch been rolled out nationally? Anything but it seems - thus at TPA just two of us in line boarding passes and photo IDs in hand - but this did not stop a martinet TSA person from bellowing at us harshly to have these items ready (with an absence of Please! too) - she did not even bother to check that we were ready for her which makes one wonder about the actual vigilance of TSA employees. Likewise long security lines at STL encouraged a TSA guy to bellow at (and irritate) all and sundry.",,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,K Peters,,Connected in DFW enroute SEA-DCA. Clean comfortable and with great amenities. Choices for eating were good. Found the concourse to be light-filled with good views of the airside. Transit time was brief but I would not hesitate to go through DFW again.,,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Chris Schmidt,,With the new Terminal D DFW has become much much better. Customs & Immigration are the quickest most efficient that I have seen at any US airport. International baggage claim is fast as well. If you are connecting to another flight however it can be a bit confusing. When visited there were several different baggage recheck stations depending on destination and there was not much direction available. Signage for inter-terminal connections in the International arrivals area is also in need of improvement. AA's domestic terminals (A and C primarily) continue to be renovated and are improving. Terminal D departures area is easily the nicest in the whole airport if not the state.,,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Sriram Srinivasan,,I live in the Dallas area and use DFW frequently. If DFW is your starting or end point it's not a bad airport really. Parking is plentiful and if you live in the area it's especially nice that you can use your TollTag to pay for parking and avoid the lines! Security rarely takes more than 10 minutes to get through; even if your line is backed up there are a minimum of 3 checkpoints in each terminal so you can just walk to another one and then walk to your gate (and now with the new inter terminal train it's a legitimate option to go through security in a different terminal altogether if you're flying AA). Bags usuallly come quickly - generally 20 minutes or less - and having the baggage claim right outside your gate area is a nice touch. If you're coming in from overseas immigration is also relatively hassle free. I frequently take the Lufthansa FRA-DFW flight that arrives mid-afternoon and I've never had to wait in line more than 20 minutes. Taxi times can be a bit longish since the airport is so huge but at least delays are fairly rare (though God help you if you get caught here during one of our rare winter storms - you're not going anywhere anytime soon as the whole metro area shuts down). I've never had to connect through DFW but I could see how the aiports massive size could cause problems for connections; then again things are supposedly much better with the new inter-terminal train system.,,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Erin Hawkins,,I fail to see why everyone is commenting on the bad plans of the layout at DFW. I wonder if they have ever visited other airports like Atlanta Hartsfield. DFW is brilliant in the fact that they have security entrances at every terminal along with a baggage claim for each terminal. Layovers aren't bad either. If you can read you can navigate through DFW. As for the individual who associated DFW as bad because American Airlines was there and they change gates all the time I challenge you to find me an airport where gate changes don't happen.,,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Chris Keller,,The problems connecting at DFW are gone with the addition of Skylink. There are 2 stations at the N & S ends of each terminals (all inside security). The new international terminal is the premiere international terminal. The maximum ride time is 10 min (furthest distance) and the wait for a train is around 2 min. Most passengers can get to another terminal if needed in a maximum time of around 15 min. Most airlines allow at least an hour to connect. Anyone with common sense would read the signs and ride Skylink to their next terminal if needed. With the addition of Skylink you will not find a better airport to begin end or connect to your final destination. DFW is far better than ATL (talk about long walks and the old underground train doesnt offer the view skylink does of Dallas & Fort Worth. DFW has positioned itself for the spike in air travel before all other major airports. Look for it to be well positioned for future passenger growth.,,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,A Cachagee,,Flying by Air Canada Jazz we used the brand new Term D that just opened the week before. I have to admit that i think that was one of the shortest walks I've taken from the gate to get to my luggage. It took about 3 mins tops to get from the gate. I didn't have to wait too long for the luggage to arrive - it took about 10-15 mins. But I guess not alot of others would get this since only flights from Canada don't have to go through customs at Term D. Upon leaving things went by pretty smooth. The check-in area is massive and the ACJ counter is at the very end. Going through security was a breeze. The only knock i had against DFW is alot of shops weren't open at the time - they should have waited at least another week before opening Term D since alot of the shops and stores weren't open yet. I'm sure by now Term D is up and running at 100%. It didn't turn out as bad as everyone said it would be.,,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Melissa Miller,,"I do like the fact that the luggage carousel is just a step away from your gate and that helps things if DFW is your final destination. I wish other airports would do that. Think of the time it would save! I also like that the check in at the curb is no more than a minute or two from your gate. However if DFW is your connecting airport that is another story! The 'airtrain"" has to be the slowest way to get to your next gate which of course is on the other side of the airport. The train is fine if you have an hour or so between flights but for some reason you are delayed it is agonizing to be on the train hoping you can make your flight. So if I were giving stars DFW would get four out of ten. Good restaurants shopping etc bathrooms not very clean.",,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Marlon Machado,,I live in Austin and I have to go through DFW more often than not. Everything they say about DFW is true and I think I know the reason: DFW was designed to be an endpoint not a hub. The horseshoe- shaped terminals are great for jumping out of the jetway go across the aisle get your luggage and get out of the terminal. I don't believe the designers thought the best way to go from point A to B is through a semi-circle. The problem is that DFW would be dead as an endpoint. Let's face it the Dallas/Fort Worth area doesn't receive that many visitors. DFW has grown so much in an attempt to make it more hub-like which is costing a lot of money: three trains (well - two now) none of which actually solves the problem sings all over the place advising you when to walk and when to take the train annoying golf carts asking you to get out of the way and all sorts of gimmicks to make the place more efficient. If out of a sudden AA went bust DFW would be a hot potato in the hands of the two city governments. So now DFW's survival depends on AA remaining aloft or some other airline taking it as a hub if AA went away. The problem is the first thing an airline operations manager will see is that DFW's design is not the best for a hub SkyLink and all.,,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,Jessica Tijani,,This airport is not as bad as people are saying. The only negative thing I can comment on is the long walk from terminal to terminal. However after 6 hours flight it was a pleasure to be able to stretch our legs and walk around a bit before our next flight. The check-out counter wasn't as bad bearing in mind we had our kids between us. Even my little on wanted to use the toilet as soon as we got to the immigration counter. It wasn't our turn but the staff asked the rest of the family to stay while I took my daughter to the toilets and back. We did have to collect our bags (route was to Orlando) and recheck them so they could be taken to Orlando. As soon as we left immigration there were airport staff waiting for us asking for bags to Orlando. The other negative is that you always have to check the boards to check which terminal you will be connecting. The announcement on our plane from London gave a different terminal when we were coming out but on getting inside airport the boards gave a completely different one. However I think it is a good airport. Yes the security checks is madness but this is the world we live in. I would rather go through this sort of security checks than be killed by some terrorist. In my opinion it is not a bad airport for its size. The airport is clean the toilet facilities were excellent the cafes restaurants and shops were good maybe a bit expensive but this is what you get at most airports.,,0
dallas-love-field-airport,M Smith,,Living in Dallas there is no comparison between Love field and DFW. Love field is much quicker and efficient. It may not be as glossy but the chances of getting out on time are much much better. Also I have had flights cancelled at DFW that were never posted on the board. A couple times I waited a couple hours then was told at the gate when I went to check in that the flight was cancelled.,4,0
dallas-love-field-airport,Matt Ray,,Great little airport. So convenient to the heart of Dallas you are in and out in a flash. Nothing like the behemoth that is DFW. DFW has nice facilities which Dallas Love does not have but you won't be hanging out there long enough to need them chances are. They do have decent places to eat so you are covered there just don't expect to go on some shopping spree.,4,0
dallas-love-field-airport,Mike Weber,,This airport is great for a quick get in and get out as the gates are relatively close together on the Southwest side of the airport. Not much in the way of shops and restaurants but this airport isn't really designed for that kind of traffic. It's probably going to have to go through some changes and cleaning as they start adding more flights.,3,0
dallas-love-field-airport,Gregg Hillier,,"I flew into Love Field recently and it is very much ""A Tale of Two Airports."" The Main Concourse where Southwest Operates has adequete food and shopping but it looks and smells like a Greyhound Terminal circa 1970. Security lines are long and slow much worse than DFW. The 3 new AA Gates in the old Braniff East Concourse are great - very clean and comfortable but quite a long walk from the Main Hall. AA built the new area in 2001 when it was competing with Legend's long-haul premium service from Love but never opened it when they pulled out of Love after 9/11. Easing the Wright Amendment forced AA back in to compete with Southwest on 4 high-volume routes. If you have cause to fly to/from Austin Kansas City St Louis or San Antonio out of Love use AA's gates.",,0
dallas-love-field-airport,David Guenthner,,A regional airport used predominantly for low-fare high-frequency service in the South Central United States. It is much smaller and much closer to downtown than DFW. The central terminal is old and not seen much in the way of updates. The security was fairly efficient on a Sunday but I can see where it would be problematic during the week. The concourses desperately need work. Southwest is the predominant carrier here and its concourse is congested stuffy and drab. Lounge areas are worn and the TVs barely work. Continental uses two gates close to the central terminal that ought to be condemned. American just recently opened three gates at the far end of the east concourse and when I say far I mean far. By the time I got to the last American gate I was almost too tired to walk back to the terminal. They spent a lot of money to make a clean and comfortable gate complex and it was completely empty.,,0
damascus-airport,J Swed,Australia,The airport's renovation seemed to come in handy no looking much more sophisticated. On the way to the airport I couldn't but help notice the new terminal that is in construction. Duty free is excellent with well anticipated manners displayed by staff. The airport itself handles more than Beirut international airport although it is much smaller in size. Restaurants sell reasonable food at magnificent prices. New bars have opened throughout the airport as well as ATMs and other necessities.,9,1
damascus-airport,J Delmonte,United Kingdom,I first arrived in Damascus in Feb 1997. Since then I have been back and forth almost 1-2 times a year since then. I am an Englishman who met and married a Syrian girl in 1998. The airport in my view was more relaxed in the old days whereby you could check in and walk back into the lounge/cafe for tea etc with your friends and family.,4,0
damascus-airport,Paul Harvey,,Our late night arrival was surprisingly easy to manage. After a coached journey to the terminal (some planes use jetties) it was straight into the immigration hall (currency exchange immediately on the right) which had a couple of lanes for “non Arab passports”. The lines moved quite quickly and we were soon into the baggage hall where our bags were waiting. Customs took no interest and one is soon landside where there is an ATM (one of a small working number in Syria) a Currency Exchange and minor shops. We were met on arrival so I cannot comment on ground transport arrangements but there did seem to be numerous “taxi drivers” seeking fares. There are many worse airports throughout the world most of which are major airports.,3,0
damascus-airport,Ralph Loehner,,It is not the most beautiful airport in the world but not the worst! I always found it OK - speed to check-in pass passport control is OK. Shopping cheap and wide range of products - VIP Lounge comfortable but old fashioned. The information system is getting better and friendliness of officials is good.,3,0
damascus-airport,Kris Janssen,,The refurbishment is finished. Everything looked clean and new. Fast check-in. Information screens were giving correct and up-to-date information. Good catering facilities to have a drink coffee or sandwich. Cheap duty free shops which are not the biggest but still have a good assortment of quality products spirits sweets perfumes etc.,4,0
damascus-airport,Roy Clogstoun,,Damascus airport must be one of the worst airports in the world. We were checking into a Saudi a flight and no information was provided on the overhead screens as to which gate was to be used for checking in. In this end one had to push trollys to all the gates to guess where the Saudia passengers were being checked in. At each counter there was a guy loading baggage on the belt and it was expected that we hand him some money. The regulation of smoking in the airport was appalling the whole airport stank of cigarettes including the toilets. The airport was undergoing refurbishment but the experience was chaotic.,1,0
damascus-airport,O Schmidt,,The airport is under refurbishment and concrete dust coats everything. Still the only working departure display is in the duty free on the upper floor. The zone between entrance and gates is declared non smoking area with one bathroom size glass cage for hundreds of potential smokers. Consequently the final pre-takeoff-smoke is shifted to the gate waiting room where all passengers including babies and allergics spent half an hour in an air which one could cut out with a knife and use as durable construction material.,1,0
damascus-airport,D Fay,,Damascus Airport gives an unfairly poor impression of Syria. The arrivals area was basic but immigration was conducted quite quickly if without charm. Departure was simply chaotic. As another reviewer pointed out the check in desks have no signage. We found our desk by a process of elimination by wandering up to each desk in turn checking the small paper sign and concluding that ours must be another one. The queue moved painfully slowly with each check in taking 5 minutes. When we reached the top of the queue we realised why - it appeared that every piece of information on out e-ticket had to be keyed in to the computer. The duty free seemed to house the only departure monitor in the whole airport. Worryingly our flight did not appear. We then noticed that the flight number and time on the boarding passes were different to those on our tickets - I guess due to typing errors. Our flight departed at the time on the ticket if we had believed he boarding pass we would have missed it ! While we passed though several security checks no-one seemed to be checking the magnetic gates and at the departure gate I noticed that a door onto the apron was unlocked and unguarded. I guess the authorities figure they have other ways of preventing terrorist attacks. The departure tax is a swingeing SYP1500 though what happens to this money is not evident - certainly not on the airport facilities. Just treat the airport as an experience and don't let it put you off visiting Syria.,1,0
damascus-airport,H Patak,,Note that the airport departure tax is SP1500 for over 12s. All taxis from airport are run by private company and are fixed rate. The cost is around $35. All previous comments re chaos at departure. excessive zeal by document checking officials overcrowding etc are still as relevant as ever. A thoroughly depressing experience in what is a friendly generous and wonderful country.,1,0
damascus-airport,Neville Calleja,,Expect to be ripped off by the taxi drivers taking you into and out of the city. Don't go with any of the people hassling you as soon as they see you come out of the airport for an airport taxi. They would charge you a mind-blowing 15euros to the city. The immigration process was fairly OK even if slow but they could do with some signposting in English. Back from the airport I was ripped off 1000 SYPs by a yellow cab. The check in process is appalling - I don't know for what does one pay 200 syp departure tax. The check in desks are in a severe need for refurbishment. My checkin desk was not even shown on the noticeboard and then a fellow passenger showed me to my checkin desk - indeed it had a handwritten sign stuck with sticky tape to the roof saying 'LONDON'! The duty free section is quite large and varied and one could make a few decently priced purchases from here. One looks forward to visiting the airport when the refurbishment currently being undertaken by a Malaysian company is completed.,2,0
damascus-airport,T Foran,,Yes the check-in process is slow. I have never seen anyone read documents as thoroughly as the Syrians do. There are several stages of scrutiny that one must pass before gaining entry to the pax area. But Syrians are friendly and generous people. Duty free is dirt cheap and in Syria it is available to domestic flights. Damascus features some of the best people watching that I have experienced anywhere. There are very few flights going to Europe and virtually none going to North America. Most flights are going to the Middle East or Africa. The array of gowns headgear and you-name-it clothing was charming and fascinating.,4,0
damascus-airport,Fed Kaprotz,,Damascus airport has two faces. The arrivals hall and the baggage reclaim hall really need some work as it looks as though they are falling apart. The baggage carousels in particular are too worn. However baggage reclaim was fast. The departures area is slightly different from other airports in that only the passenger can go to the area with the check-in desks. Check-in can be very slow even with short lines of people. Thankfully they don't seem to be too bothered about overweight luggage. Everyone needs to pay a departure tax before passport control - don't forget this! Then before you get to your gate you can access some shops selling newspapers tobacco and coffee.,,0
damascus-airport,Hani Al-Ahdal,,I was happy with the acceptable duty free with good prices arrival at immigration is terrible with long queues and people cutting through the lines with ease - expect a minimum of 40 minutes to pass the immigration desks specially at peak hours. The security check at the departure hall is chaotic and it may be wise to use your shoulders to shrug your way through. Check in counters are acceptable depending on your airline.,,0
damascus-airport,Steven Geerling,,Ride from city to airport should not cost more than 200 Syrian pounds in a metered taxi. Airport was quiet at that moment which could not prevent the chaos at the first security checkpoint. Passport checked four times (including immigration and check-in). Although I had an e-ticket with LH and OS it turned out that DAM is not an e-ticket station and could not accept this. Airline staff at check-in phoned the Austrian office downtown trying to solve the problem but they couldn't change it either which meant that I had to buy a new ticket for the DAM-VIE leg. VIE-AMS could be continued on the e-ticket again although not without more hassle at VIE itself. Airline-staff courteous and friendly. Executive Lounge is roomy with good food and several liquors (it's still an islamic country). Prices in the duty-free shops looked okay. Don't know about the toilets which have been mentioned in previous comments.,,0
damascus-airport,T Waugh,,"Damascus Airport was quite an experience! The duty free as others have said IS amazingly cheap and very well stocked. When I got to Immigration the fun began. The visa was fine but the officials I met had never seen a New Zealand Passport before! After a few phone calls to HQ in town they let me in with a lot of apologies. They were very friendly though. Once through there is an ATM to withdraw cash a currency conversion booth or two and a counter where you pay 600 syrian pounds for a taxi voucher then they see you into the taxi. Going out even more of an experience! 75 syrian pounds to get a baggage trolley and get in then someone takes off with the trolley 'to whisk you through further"" then it's baksheesh for another hundred pounds... not a lot of money just annoying. Passport check at front of check in hall. Check in were very friendly another passport check. Then you pay two hundred pounds departure tax then go for the third passport check... this is the proper passport check departure Syria. The toilets are holes in the ground and they stink. The only thing that really bugged me was being locked in a glass cage with a hundred or so other people for an hour and a half while we waited for the aeroplane to arrive. If there had been toilets and water available after passport control it would not have been too bad -thank goodness I happened to have some water and juice with me just in case!!",,0
damascus-airport,Christopher Laylem,,I know that summer is the busiest time for air traffic in the Middle East. I was expecting to go through hell during my connection at Damascus International Airport. I was completely wrong. When i arrived from London the airport was experiencing its maximum traffic. My connection time was 5 hours. I was amazingly surprised by the low prices at the fantastic duty free. It was one of the nicest i have ever seen. I got a great deal on an EOS camera; 90 dollars less than the price in England! Apart from the duty free i spent time at the modern internet cafe. I was able to complete a lot of work there. I also enjoyed a nice meal at the cafe. I was able to pass the time enjoyable. I arrived at the boarding gate it was full however the tickets were processed immediately and i was greeted with a warm smile. I believe that Damascus International Airport has really made efforts to be recognized as a world class airport.,,0
damascus-airport,G Chew,,During peak time the check-in area is near impossible to navigate. Most passengers just push their way to the front of queues so if you want to be served you also have to push and be ruthless. Airside the airport is clean and the duty-free is excellent (very cheap) though apart from shop there is nothing else to do - though you spend so much time queuing in immigration and for x-rays and check-in and to buy airport tax etc etc etc that there's never much time left.,,0
damascus-airport,D Anand,,Damascus airport is small but clean. The toilets on first floor have no water so rush to ground floor is heavy particularly when 747 SP brings a full load of passengers. If joining from Damascus come well in time. Only two X-Rays machine were working and there was made rush due to ID holidays. Do not forget to purchase SP 200 airport departure tax stamp otherwise you shall have to return from Immigration. The counter staff and Immigration personnel are very co-operative.,,0
damascus-airport,Fadi Karkoush,,Clean and tidy lots of seats good number of passport control desks resulting in no delays. A very high standard duty free with cheap quality goods. Got a Seiko watch for about £90 and found out when I got back to the UK that it costs £350 on the high street!,,0
damascus-airport,Paul Ross,,I was a transit passenger through Damascus airport twice. On the face of it it appears clean and tidy but as you spend more time there it's seriously lacking. Firstly there's no where to change money or obtain visa advances. I arrived with £1000GBP of travellers cheques and had a 4 hour connection. I was unable to purchase any food or drink and the 1 restaurant that is there only accepts Syrian money. If you are lucky you can pay with euro pounds or dollars in hard cash. Otherwise you have to starve or die of first. There is a duty free shop that accepts visa and sells incredibly cheap cigarettes (I think they were $1USD a packet). However you won't be able to buy any food or drink to consume with your visa card unless you don't mind living off toblerone and whisky. Toilets didn't have any toilet paper in them. I was sitting on the seats and I left my girlfriend. When I returned she had moved because an older Syrian (I presume?) guy had started waving his stick at her and telling her to move. He had then requisitioned the whole seat and sat around 9 burkah wearing women on the seat opposite him. Transfer desk and being booked onto the next flight was efficient apart from competing with Indians for a Delhi transfer was like taking part in a scrum. The airport seriously needs a money changer and VISA ATM in the departure lounge.,,0
damascus-airport,Hadi Madwar,,I think Damascus International Airport is much better than it used to be. The duty Free is among the best i have seen it is clean and ckeck in is really quick. The new business lounge is nice. IThe ggod thing is that there is never crowding problems because of quick passport control and numerous check in desks.,,0
dammam-port-airport,R Pattison,United Kingdom,The place is awful to both fly into and depart from. Unorganised chaos poor facilities rude immigration staff. Just avoid it at all costs. I've flown into hundreds of airports all over the world and this place is the worst. I would strongly advise flying out of Bahrain.,,0
dammam-port-airport,Zaeem Saeed,Saudi Arabia,This airport is probably the worst airport I have visited so far. The seating area seats were very dirty the carpets were completely littered with chip wrappers. I didn't see any cleaners or airport staff cleaning the area. The bathrooms are very in poor state no hygiene whatsoever. The service was poor and unacceptable.,,0
dammam-port-airport,R Gawthorpe,United Arab Emirates,Dirty old fashioned no helpful staff almost no facilities even to get a decent coffee while waiting to board. Wifi has not worked in over a year.,,0
dammam-port-airport,Howard Baker,United Kingdom,This airport is so below standard as to make it worthy of being a bad third world airport. Sure the building is to a good standard but what is the point when the facilities are rubbish. Immigration: 4 hours or more standing there are few seats and with the staff telling you to stand. I have visited too many airports where you would expect poor service due to it being a poor country many have made you far more welcome queues at least move people try and get you through. Words are not enough to state the lack of quality of this airport.,,0
dammam-port-airport,Herman Maas,Saudi Arabia,No flight information no staff who can communicate in English to clear customs for international flights will take a very long time. The lounges are below standard airports are old taxis outside do not use meters and therefore the drivers set the price. I have flown and travelled all over the world but when comparing Saudi airports in general to other international airports Saudi airports lack quality in just about every department very disappointing indeed.,,0
dammam-port-airport,P Harris,United Kingdom,Recently flew in and out of Riyadh airport and commented on how appalling the whole airport experience was. Complete chaos on entering the airport queues completely ignored people pushing to the front with officials ignoring the fact passport control inefficient beyond words total lack of customer care or basic respect for other human beings. Leaving queues of people standing for up to 6 hours waiting for a totally disinterested official to grunt and gesture at you before begrudgingly stamping your passport allowing entry or exit. This time I thought Dammam would be a viable alternative to the Riyadh experience there cannot possibly be 2 airports in the same country that are so appallingly below any reasonable standard can there? Yes there can Dammam was actually a slightly worse experience than Riyadh! The passport control people are clones of their Riyadh counterparts total disinterest in anything other than their tea breaks socialising with their colleagues staring at their mobile phones and generally sitting around doing nothing for long periods before waving the next unfortunate traveller up to the desk. Please fill out an exit card before queuing I was told there were no cards available when I started and told to join the queue anyway. By the time I got to the front cards had actually appeared some way back in the passport control area (no one was told this). So I was then turned away and sent to the back of the queue again told to fill out an exit card. There must have been 20-30 people straight after me who had this experience. Basic levels of customer care are totally devoid here. In contrast I landed at Heathrow disembarked passport control and picked up my case in 35mins - a shining example of what an airport can do when run by intelligent efficient caring people - these places are two polar opposites!,,0
dammam-port-airport,D Vermeeren,Saudi Arabia,We have flown in and out of this local airport regularly for the past nine years. while the facility is large/oversized the service is far below acceptable international standards. Immigration and passport control on entering the country is slow and can take over 2-3 hours depending upon your arrival time since this airport is the first entry point for many Asian low wage workers. If you are in line behind a 747 full of new workers you will be stuck for a very long time so presume the worst. The recent new rule requiring finger prints for all departing passengers will now make exit worse mandatory check in is now 4 hours before departure; with nothing to do this can be rough.,1,0
dammam-port-airport,Ahmet Asker,Turkey,I arrived in Turkish airways from Istanbul to Dammam. When I reached the immigration I found more than 200 people standing in the available 4 counters for the first time/visit visa of which there was just one counter with a personnel. It was a total mess with few people coming to the counter for a few minutes and then serving a few people and then going for a break. My flight landed at 01.00 am and I was only able to clear the immigration at 07.00 am. When I tried to tell the person in counter about the 6 hour wait he pointed at some other passengers and stated that they reached at 10 pm. I found it total negligence and I would not recommend any first time visitor to select this airport.,1,0
dammam-port-airport,T Balles,United Kingdom,This is by far the worst airport I've flown into. I flew First Class from London to Dammam via Doha. The immigration procedure is mind numbing. It took more than 2 hours to clear immigration having arrived along with flights from Kenya Bangladesh and Dubai. Immigration officials were busy chatting with each other and having constant coffee breaks. On my return flight departures took almost an hour - again seeing immigration officials taking coffee breaks instead of doing their jobs! I almost missed my flight.,1,0
dammam-port-airport,David Hewett,United Kingdom,I arrived at this airport from Dubai at about 10pm and it took 2.5 half hours to get through immigration. Staff were slow unwilling to do anything to sort the queue and generally obnoxious.,1,0
dammam-port-airport,R Skilb,United Kingdom,Poor airport to be honest and I've used it a number of times. The last time I flew I got my boarding passes and went to go through passport control only to be told the flight was delayed until the next day. I was turned away with many others I suspect people may have even left the airport. Eventually I was told it was on time I then joined a lengthy passport control queue. I waited around 45 mins and got within 5 people of the front to discover the person running the queue had left without warning. He returned 20 mins later staff seemed unfriendly making the whole thing even worse.,2,0
dammam-port-airport,H Nemer,,I've traveled via this airport many times for international flights using different airlines - recently service has improved in terms of shops available as well as airlines serving this destination. I would recommend using Dammam airport for travelling to the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia as the roads has also improved after constructing new tunnels and bridges it wouldn't take more than 45 minutes to reach the airport from any nearby city including Khobar and Jubail.,5,0
dammam-port-airport,Martin Brown,,"Dammam airport is huge with about 65 gates but in reality it doesn't need to be. Arrival was painless. Immigration looks as if it will take forever at first but as soon as immigration staff realise it's going to be busy they open more desks and the queue soon clears. Customs scan every bag from every person as you leave. When returning you must have your checked luggage scanned before check in otherwise you cannot check the bag. Queues for check in weren't too bad but then I was 3 hours early for the KLM flight. Be prepared before going through security as although the queue looks long it moves fast and security staff get annoyed if they have to ask you to remove your belt watch etc but they are very pleasant if you are ready. The flight I was waiting for was leaving at 1:15am and there were a few international flights but the cafe was closed. The only place to buy refreshments was from a ""trolley"" however the coffee wasn't bad and wasn't too expensive but nothing to eat that was hot. There is one duty free shop with various items for sale (including washing powder?) and prices are okay. I walked from one end of the airport to the other which took 10 minutes at normal pace and only 6 gates had passengers waiting by them. Interestingly there used to be a few Business Class lounges but these appear to have been closed and moved to one lounge such is the under use of this airport. I would be happy to fly though this airport again mainly because even though there is nothing really to do it is easy to find somewhere quiet to relax and plenty of seats and the staff are mostly very friendly.",4,0
dammam-port-airport,Nick Wallace,,Not much to add to the comments below. Immigration tends to be slow. Security very thorough requiring removal of belts with metal buckles and shoes. Needless passport and boarding card inspections between departure lounge and aircraft.,,0
dammam-port-airport,Peter Morison,,Dammam Airport is a fairly new construction situated in the desert about 60 kilometres from the Dammam/Dahran/Al Khobar metropolitan area and a similar distance from the petro-chemical industrial city of Jubail. It is large pretty well organised and clean. It seems to be operating well under capacity. Due to its distance from town reaching the airport by road can take up to an hour and a half depending where you start from and a taxi fare which is the only way to get there is going to be high - around US$50+. Despite its size facilities for passangers waiting for flights are pretty limited with a couple of unispiring cafes and gift shops. A long wait there can be very boring and it makes sense to obtain a bording pass in advance for Saudia flights from their offices in town to reduce the amount of time spent at the airport. Of course if your flight is delayed you have no choice but to sit tight and wait. For very long delays as there is no hotel at the airport the long trip back to Dammam to find a bed is a would be required. If you are flying Saudia don't expect them to help much. An alternative worth considering if you are traveling to or from the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia is to fly through Bahrain as the airport there is about the same distance from the centre of Dammam as Dammam airport is. Crossing the causeway is pretty straight forward outside of the Saudi weekend when it becomes busy to Bahrain on Thursday afternoon/evening and Back to Saudi on Friday evening. Bahrain airport much more customer friendly but taxi fare will be more approx US100.,,0
dar-es-salaam-airport,Liam Rutter,United Kingdom,"I have to say my second arrival in Dar was much better than the first. First time arrived amid a plague of flying cockroach-like insects that were all attracted to the light inside the terminal. Spent ages swatting them in a huge line for immigration that took over an hour only to then be told I needed a ""special"" permit and had to pay 200 USD (I already had a business visa). Not wanting to argue I joined the next disorganised line paid my 200 USD and waited another 30 minutes to get my passport back. Notable that everyone in the ""special"" line was Caucasian. Second time all desks open for immigration friendly hello from the official and a quick stamp and on my way. No ""special"" permit needed this time for some reason. Bags came out quickly and was out of the airport within 10 minutes of landing. Let's hope that the new terminal will be finished on time and that there will be no more ""special"" line.",5,0
dar-es-salaam-airport,A Adomako,Ghana,I came in on a KQ (Kenya Air) flight from Ghana and immigration was a breeze. Immigration officials were pleasant and fast. I didn't have check in bags but as I waited for my colleague who did need a visa I could see that the bags arrival was quite orderly. Outside had the usual cab drivers trying to make a living by offering you a ride - is that such a big deal? I will add another review after I leave today - but we were able to check in online nicely!,9,1
dar-es-salaam-airport,Z Zakhem,Lebanon,This is the worst airport I've been to. Very unpleasant staff. They don't understand French in customs so they couldn't figure out my passport's expiration date. Very chaotic and disorganised especially during check-in.,1,0

dar-es-salaam-airport,Dirk Visser,Netherlands,Terminal feels like it was built in the 1960s and is stuck in a time warp. Very small and a bit cramped with some (expensive) shops airside and some cafeterias. Dimly lit inside and air conditioning is not optimal so on hot days it can get quite uncomfortable. Waiting area is alright but not comfortable. No WiFi in the airport; not even in the lounge. Staff at check-in can be surly and waiting times at security and check-in ridiculously long with everything done manually. Immigration and visa staff actually nice and fairly efficient; no complaints there.,5,0
dar-es-salaam-airport,K Kerenge,Tanzania,The service quality from security guards and the staff is probably the worst you can possibly get. The waiting area is uncomfortable not enough seating with awful toilets. All in all a lousy airport.,1,0
dar-es-salaam-airport,Robert Halverson,United States,Another horrible airport. We arrived on a South African Airways flight from Johannesburg in the afternoon. We were funnelled into immigration and customs area which has no air conditioning in this hot and humid city. Foreigners gathered around the glass booths where officials came out took your passport and visa payment then disappeared inside. The process took about an hour meanwhile our luggage had been taken off the conveyer belt and put aside unguarded in a hallway. When you exit the terminal you are hounded by taxi drivers asking outrageous prices. When we arrived to fly out our Precision Air flight had broken down in Zanzibar and was delayed. However they gave few details on when it was expected to resume. It was a very uncaring attitude by the check-in staff. We were delayed 3 hours and were caught off guard by the sudden (and muffled) announcement that it was now boarding. The departure lounge has some stores but they are limited. The airport is small with few facilities.,1,0
dar-es-salaam-airport,Hangyun Kim,South Korea,'Simplicity' is the word to describe Dar es Salaam International Airport. The terminal itself is very basic and rudimentary. But it does have most facilities that an international airport needs. There are 'duty free shops' that sell souvenirs T-shirts electric's and cosmetics. There are restaurants that sell 'western' cuisine and soft drinks but they are overpriced. Toilets were ok not clean but not too unhygienic. Ground service was rather slow but immigration process was swift both in and out. But the airport is a bit disorganized. No A/C before the security but there is after. Don't expect wi-fi service.,3,0
dar-es-salaam-airport,Kagwe Gichohi,Kenya,I travelled to Dar for the weekend in April and found the airport much smaller that I expected. Nevertheless it is fairly clean and design allows for natural airflows - important in Dar. Arrival relatively painless although the baggage conveyor belt doesn't work so instead there are airport officials asking which flight you were in and directing you to the bags. Departure was a different thing altogether. I needed to purchase a ticket but lo and behold there wasn't a single ticketing office (airline offices and agents included) that accepted any kind of cards whatsoever. So the trick is to withdraw cash at ATM. There are three ATMs and everyone at the airport was quite sure they don't work. I approached all 3 to confirm for myself but was waved away by staff and security as well as shop attendants who were quite sure they do not work. Mercifully a taxi man offered to take me to the nearest one that may be working outside the airport for free - an offer I accepted. Having bought the ticket I chose to sit at the airport - there is sitting outside the building in a kind of pavilion which is good for the heat but the seats are hard. There was no wifi so I elected to visit the only cyber cafe at the airport which had ok speeds but charged in blocks of half an hour. As I was sending emails and waiting for replies I found that method rather inconvenient. There is only one restaurant at the top with fairly good meals which I sampled whist still waiting for the flight. After checking in I proceeded to the gate I was shown waiting to board. When the boarding call was made I proceeded towards the gate but the airport staff denied be entry via that gate suggesting it was for a different flight. I was referred to other staff who referred me to the same gate and told me to wait there. We did this back and forth for a while - with me showing ticket indicating I was at the correct gate. In the end the same staff started announcing my name for final boarding call. I told them I was the one and they seemed surprised. Fortunately airline staff happened by and intervened allowing me to gain entry via the exact same gate. I raised the matter with the airline staff who didn't seem surprised at all by the escapade. I almost missed the flight over something so simple. I felt the airport staff should have been a bit more attentive and methodical in their handling of the situation.,2,0
dar-es-salaam-airport,J Hertzler,United States,"Needed to change airlines and reclaim and recheck luggage here en route to Nampula Mozambique. It was not at all clear which to do first. Consequently we got on the flight to Nampula on LAM but our luggage did not. Other passengers told us that this happens ""most of the time"" on this flight. The problems with baggage appear to originate in the Dar es Salaam terminal. Had it not been for some friendly and helpful staff we might not have gotten through at all.",3,0
dar-es-salaam-airport,Philip Keating,,Flew through at 22.00 with Swiss it was very quick bag drop - (check in online if you can as you can drop it of at first class desk). Airport still hot but the guys at the cafe friendly and serve drinks quick. When you have passed security at the gate they have air conditioning which is heaven after the heat of Tanzania. I like this small airport - have never had a problem and have used it several times.,4,0
dar-es-salaam-airport,J Mathieson,,This is not a good place to travel through. They stopped improving it in about 1957. There is no way you can use a credit card here to buy an airline ticket. To go and buy a ticket you have to go through security - but you need a ticket to go through security - you then have to get a pass to go through security by leaving your passport behind. Very disorganized chaotic slow lines repetitive checking for no reason hot sweaty limited service. The business class lounge is not too bad. This place really needs some work. The smaller airports in Tanzania are fine but this one has to be the worst airport for its size I have been in. The only saving grace is that most of the people are nice.,1,0
dar-es-salaam-airport,Philip Keating,,My flight was at 21.20 on a Friday night. It was very busy and if you are travelling at this time leave at least 2 hours to get to your gate. I have got through to the departure gate in 30 minutes on previous.,3,0
dar-es-salaam-airport,F Pang,,An airport with very basic facilities. Arrival was smooth: I waited for around 15 min for immigration clearance and 10 min for customs clearance (which was ok). In front of visa counter I saw crowds of passengers applying for visa (fortunately I did not need a visa) so if you are flying with a wide-body aircraft and you need a visa it pays to disembark as early as possible so you could proceed to visa counter quickly. The taxi stand outside arrival hall claimed to offer 'govt-regulated' fares to different parts of the city but the list could be ignored as it is pricey. Bargain with drivers. There was an exchange shop at the far end of the arrival hall which offered a relatively better exchange rate - Very similar to the rate in city so if one needs to buy some TZS that's a better option. Departure was more chaotic with the main problem being a lack of any flight information display. You just do not know which lounge is for which flight. There are a few shops in departure lounges but not impressive in particular.,3,0
dar-es-salaam-airport,Philip Keating,,There are some bars and restaurants 5 mins from the airport that are not expensive on the main road. I had to travel in rush hour it pays to get to the airport early in rush hour but you can not enter the airport before your check in time. I agree the traffic is very bad in rush hour. There is not much to keep you entertained out side the airport so there is no point getting there to early.,3,0

dar-es-salaam-airport,S Marsden,,Dar airport was probably very nice when it first opened however after decades of neglect by the airports authority it is not surprise that it is looking shabby unkempt. The airport is slow but get used to it nobody rushes in Dar. The business class lounge (soon to be rebuilt but not in a hurry!) is appalling in comparison to other airports it's got free drinks and snacks and if you are lucky you may get a seat. On the flip side of this you have the fact that if you are arriving its the gateway to one of the most beautiful and friendliest countries in the world. Look past Dar airport!,2,0
dar-es-salaam-airport,Terry Jacobs,,Dar must have the slowest system of processing people on arrival in the world. The queues snake up the stairs as the single kiosk attempts to deal with it all. So when you reach the bottom of the stairs you have about an hour to go. Once you get to the kiosk they take a computerised mug shot of you then you just hang around for another half an hour while that gets in the system. The whole airport needs levelling and rebuilding.,1,0
dar-es-salaam-airport,Alun Pugh,,Domestic terminal is great fun. You hang about with the pilots and other passengers etc watching the flights come and go.

The international terminal (built to replace the old domestic terminal) is a mess. Sweaty (aircon doesn't work) poor value shops and inefficient - a real third world job.,2,0
dar-es-salaam-airport,Ingvar Backéus,,I have used this airport many times since 1974. In the 70s the terminal building looked like a shabby rural bus station but the building that was then erected is nice and also architecturally beautiful from inside. Decent shops. Two lounges which are small but nice and -particularly important - cool. The rest of the building is hot and humid and the a/c in the departure hall is hardly working. The toilets can also be cumbersome since water is frequently lacking.,,0
dar-es-salaam-airport,Philip Keating,,I was suprised when going through this airport. I had purchased my visa in London before leaving. There was a small queue for non Tanzanian passport holders but a Tanzanian immigration officer said I could go through the Tanzanian passport desk. I was through in a couple of minutes. My bag was ready for collection.It was the fastest I have ever been through an airport. The only down side was the price of cigarettes in the duty free shop on leaving. They where double the price if you had bought from a supermarket in Dar Es Sallam.,,0
dar-es-salaam-airport,Frans Erkens,,For a very small airport in a poor African country its really not bad. The departure hall is relatively spacious with plenty of seats a decent cafeteria and restaurant and a good selection of souvenir shops and there's even a bc lounge (not sure if its for a certain airline). The arrival area is less nice. It is below the departure area and looks like just a concrete basement area. Neither level is fully enclosed and especially on the arrivals level which opens directly outside (no doors) there will probably be mosquitos etc. inside. There is a foreign curency exchange offering the same rates as those in the city. There isn't really any public transport (unless you count the dalla-dallas (minibuses) on the highway outside which will undoubtedly be impossible to board with any luggage) but as soon as you exit if no one meets you you're likely to have taxi drivers approaching you from all directions (don't pay more than 10000tsh (about $9).,,0
darwin-airport,N Dawes,Australia,Arrived at airport to find very little assistance and no check-in staff available despite mid afternoon time. Upstairs in departure lounges are old cracked dirty and missing pieces of vinyl. No bar facilities available again despite mid afternoon time and crowds of people in the lounge area. Very poorly sign posted. Nil star rating if that was possible!,,0
darwin-airport,Eve Spence,Australia,I arrived here on a Jetstar flight from Brisbane with my 85 year old mother who needed a wheelchair. This latter was provided by Jetstar but then we were on our own to travel from the plane to the baggage area not an easy task as signage was almost non-existent and some doors along the way were locked necessitating a rather anxious wait until an official with a key card arrived. The only lift in the main area of the terminal was broken down although there was no sign about this just a loose flapping internal wall that was evident when the doors opened. This discouraged all users including us. In the end we ditched the wheelchair and proceeded slowly down the escalator. There was a total lack of information signage or assistance of any kind in this outdated dirty terminal. I intend to avoid this airport in future.,,0
darwin-airport,K Pardoe,Australia,International area of terminal to catch a domestic flight to Cairns flight originated in Singapore. There were only 2 flights leaving our A321 plus a flight to Dili. Seating area was full to capacity. Male toilets completely inadequate for number of people. It was early in the morning approx 5am the coffee shop was open but the only other shop (newsagent) was closed.,3,0
darwin-airport,Paul Harvey,,"Flew in and out to and from Singapore on the way to Cairns - a bit of an uneven experience. The first time was early in the morning and most of the airport facilities were shut despite flights using the airport. Security screening into the transit lounge removed the water we had been given five minutes earlier on our Jetstar flight and there was no where to buy any more. On the way back we transited at Darwin for five hours and so went downtown by taxi ($22). Leaving the airport was easy and we were able to check our hand baggage at left luggage without trouble. Security was confusing on the way back you are first checked for everything other than ""the plastic bag"" which is then separately checked at another check point by staff some of whom have not learnt politeness. Although the airport is cramped and needs enlarging. there are far worse around. Duty Free is very expensive as are the cafes.",3,0
darwin-airport,Anil Kaushik,,Used DRW this morning to fly back to SYD. At 6.30am the airport was too crowded and obviously needs to be expanded. Small selection of F&B outlets and even at that time of the morning it was way too hot and humid. It felt as if the air conditioning had not been started. All in all not very pleasant.,2,0
darwin-airport,Steven Parish,,Darwin airport might be fine for domestic flights but is not up to scratch as an international airport. With more Tiger and Jetstar flights to Asia via Darwin this airport needs to lift its game. It took nearly an hour to get through immigration and customs on my flight from Singapore which was only 60% full. Only three immigration officers on duty - one queue for all nationalities - while two customs officers eyeing the stationary queue for drug mules. These officers then searched every second bag (welcome to Australia!) before we got into the small and uninspiring terminal where check-in queues can be horrendous.,1,0
darwin-airport,P Taylor,,If you want slow immigration clearances and unfriendly staff on arrival Darwin is your port of choice. Most flights arrive into Darwin in the early hours of the morning. Staff is always short. And everyone is given the third degree and queuing is not segregated. So if your an Australian behind a family of 5 overseas visitors expect to sit waiting for them while visas travel arrangements and passports are examined in every minute detail even though most residents arriving are a quick once over. I choose to fly into any other airport in Australia if returning from international destinations. The last flight I returned from overseas was a Tiger flight from Singapore. It was full and 90min late. Approximately 30% of the flight were late for a connecting Melbourne flight which was awaiting them. All these 30% were poorly directed to just 1 immigration staff while 1 experienced and 2 trainees looked after the rest of the flight. Most of the transit customers lined up in the normal queue and were returned to the back of the transit queue once they reached the front as there were only a few staff giving verbal directions to arriving customers. In addition the International arrival and departure areas are small. Its not uncommon for arriving queues to snake back through the airbridges. It looks as if the international terminal was added as an afterthought. The only thing Darwin Airport has going for it is free and ready access to smoking areas in departure lounges.,1,0
darwin-airport,Trevor Hoad,,Compared to other airports its very small but pleasant with limited shops and dinning options. Very quick check-in and cleared security in record time. Had to walk out through a sheltered walkway to board the flight to Perth.,4,0
darwin-airport,J Buche,,Regrettably domestic doesn't have much in the way of seating for waiting passengers whose check-in desks have not opened as access to shops and departure lounges is through security with only a small cafe on the ground floor. The airport needs to invest in some waiting area seats provide some more vending machines entertainment facilities and more ground floor shops.,1,0
darwin-airport,Christian Hodson,,I have made frequent visits to Australia both for business and pleasure over the last ten years although in April I made my first visit to Darwin. I arrived domestically on a Qantas flight from Adelaide and there were no complaints - hardly any distance to walk from the arrival gate and relatively quick baggage delivery. My international departure to Singapore however a few days later was a different story. Check-in takes place for all flights domestic and international in a very small terminal area. There were two check-in staff servicing a fairly full A330-300 aircraft and although we arrived a good 2 hours prior to departure we had to queue practically outside the terminal building and by the time we arrived at the desk we had about twenty minutes to get through immigration and security. As a result the flight had to be delayed. Qantas international departures use gate 6 I think at Darwin - three immigration officers were on duty for the whole flight which I find to be completely unacceptable. The gate area contains one duty free shop / cafe and has seating for about 80 people at best - I can imagine a huge delay here to be purgatory. The upside of the airport is that it is only 5-10 minutes from the city centre by car and would probably have to rate as one of the best landings into an airport in the world for scenery but they need to get one or two things sorted particularly the international flight departures before it can be regarded as being a great gateway to a fantastic Australian city.,,0
darwin-airport,Xuess Wee,,The airport is rather small compared to its other Australian siblings then again it only served a handful of International Airlines (mainly Garuda Continental & Qantas). Only 5-10 minutes from the Esplanade of Darwin via Airport Shuttle Bus - it's practically built on the edge of the city. Checking-in and clearing customs are done efficiently with minimal fuss. I was in the Domestic Terminal and it does have 1 thing that strikes me most - 3 large electrifying photos of lightning decked the walls of the waiting hall leaving a strong impression.,,0
davao-airport,S Fletcher,United Kingdom,Davao City airport in the Philippines is spacious queues are minimal pre check in. After check in you head upstairs to the departure area pay your departure tax and pass through security. You then find yourself in a the domestic departure area where there is plenty of seating and TV screens. Flight announcements are limited my flight was delayed by 2 hours yet there was no announcement to advise.,8,1
davao-airport,A McNicol,Australia,From and to Singapore on Silk Air. This is a functional airport which in the Philippines is high praise! Security checks are numerous and slow as everywhere in the Philippines but because of the small number of international passengers moves quite quickly. The same can be said for check-in baggage claim and immigration. Toilet facilities are sufficient and clean. On the downside for those who need shops there is only one very small cafe before immigration and a kiosk selling very basic items in the gate area. All in all a good facility in the Philippines.,7,1
davao-airport,A Flores,Singapore,International flight from SG. Arrival quick but when passengers started to queue up for immigration the lights in the hall were switched off. The only thing that lit the hall was the sun from the windows. After 10 minutes of darkness someone finally realized they needed to turn on the lights. Departure was ok except for the time consuming queue for x-rays. Basic international airport. There's room for improvement.,7,1
davao-airport,L Javier,Argentina,Departures area uses natural light the main drawback is the layer of security personnel and the number of X- ray machines being used. Check-in counters are looking battered. No area for wait listed passengers. Stores are outrageously priced. Pre-departure lounge is getting to be a bit crowded with a wifi that is not really working and toilets that either are not fixed or smell. The airport is looking like a giant billboard of advertisements. Tourist information area may need further improvement.,7,1
davao-airport,H Hernan,,I like the design it is being upgraded in terms of services given by the Airport Authority and soon I expect they open International destination in our region.,4,0
davao-airport,S Chan,,Arrival to the airport got me the wrong impression of the airport since arrival hall was almost non air-conditioned and with old facilities. Baggage collection slow and hall was dim (but it was 0305 in the morning anyway). Departure hall was the opposite but security was extra-tight following the bomb in 2003. 5 check-points (1st-Searching taxi boot 2nd-When getting off taxi 3rd-Before entering airport 4th-Immediately after entering airport 5th- After checking in and going upstairs 6th-(Optional) Final handchecked point for Silkair passengers) before getting to the lounge. Signage was very good and clear. Plentiful gates and check-in desks. However I was shocked right before the 3rd checkpoint that we had to pay for a mandatory Terminal Fee of Php 550. I thought they would include it into the airline ticket. I ran out of money and was forced to exchange money at the store inside the airport. The lowest possible rates was there they must have earned a lot. Davao Airport is not very good especially with such a high terminal fee. No seats in the arrival hall (for people picking us up).,2,0
davao-airport,D Ernst,,Check-in is a breeze? I pass there every two weeks and never meet any breeze. Airport tax is 200 Pesos domestic and 550 international a blow in the face of so many people. Increasing over more than 500%! Guests who come to pick me up were send out from the arrival hall like dogs to wait in burning sun with no place to sit or have a drink. A lack of stores and restaurants inside the terminal. Davao International Airport is the only airport where you get your shoes x-rayed twice before you can pass.,2,0
davao-airport,Larry Smith,,Davao International Airport is the only airport where you get your shoes xray'd twice. You have to remove shoes and xray them to gain access to the check-in area. After check-in you move to your departure lounge area and then go through another xray and physical baggage check and again off with the shoes and through the xray machine. Why is this done twice. It causes a backlog at the xray machines as people are trying to get shoes back on and their baggage is clogging up the machines.,3,0
davao-airport,N Royan,,The first security check outward bound is on the approach road and includes a search of the taxi boot and a request to examine passports. This is all very reassuring and necessary following the terrorist bomb in 2003. The terminal building is excellent; modern clean and spacious yet small enough to feel intimate and friendly compared with the ghastly Ninoy Aquino Interantional in Manila. Once past the check in desk the layout is stylish yet functional with the upper storey bars and souvenir shop a useful diversion. Final departure facilities are impressive for a provincial airport. There are plentiful seats and spotless toilets. I am sure that the residents of this lovely city must be proud of their airport.,4,0
davao-airport,Peter Angliongto,,Much nicer than the old airport but issues with security after x-ray they did a hand check because I had AA batteries in my camera which were confiscated. That was a first of course he didn't take the other batteries I had in the case. There is an eating place after security it's the smoking lounge which is OK if you can stand the pall hanging over you. Waiting area is better than NAIA 1.,,0
davao-airport,Peter Angliongto,,Good Modern Airport. About 20 minutes to downtown. Has a domestic and international section. Due to security reasons arriving and departing passengers have to get off and on in the parking lot and walk under the sun for about 50 meters to the terminal despite ample arrival and departure space. Not very sensible in my opinion. Airport tax is 40 Pesos but there are rumours it will be raised to Php 200. Once past the 2nd floor security checkpoint where they have a bunch of stores and foodstall there is no place to get food in the waiting lounges.,,0
davao-airport,T Ballesteros,,The new Davao International airport which opened last year is way much better than the old one. parking is plentiful. check-in is a breeze. everything is computerized and the level of comfort surpasses of that the manila centennial terminal 2 (NAIA II). The only drawback is the lack of stores and restaurants inside the terminal.,,0
daytona-beach-airport,S Reding,,Its easy to get around very friendly people and easy to get bags and leave. Always a good experience and they have free wifi so never a problem with communication.,5,0
daytona-beach-airport,Paul Townsend,,This airport on Florida's East Coast is a beautiful little facility! Upon deplaning I was greeted by a small but spacious and superbly appointed six-gate terminal which was quite welcoming. The terminal is remarkably well-maintained and is very user-friendly with nice short distances good signage and a few clean shops to pick up a magazine or a quick meal. The personnel (both Delta and the airport security) were some of the most courteous airport employees that I have seen in a while with an genuine eagerness to serve. The only downside to DAB is the relatively small number of airlines and flight choices; prices are often higher than Orlando or Jacksonville and you will probably have to catch a connecting flight through a major hub to get to your destination. And auto racing fans can catch a good view of Daytona International Speedway (right across the street from the airport) on landing if they are lucky.,5,0
deer-lake-regional-airport,Derian Cutler,Canada,A nice airport very clean. Weather is often bad but the airport cant control that. Has a delicious restaurant and a nice little gift shop. The luggage claim was a little slow and they took one of our pieces of luggage to the check-in counter without informing us. Other than that a very nice little airport.,4,0
delhi-airport,Simon Darnbrough,United Kingdom,"Very clean, relatively new airport with quick efficient service. On arrival, through border control and collected bags within 30 minutes. On departure checked in and through security within 20 minutes. Plenty of seating at gates and good choice of food and drink, although not cheap! Toilets are spotless. Overall a good airport.",9,1
delhi-airport,M Bertram,Australia,"Arriving into Delhi (T1) was a bit of a shambles, particularly in trying to secure a prepaid taxi, there was really no queue to speak of. However, I was so pleasantly surprised when departing from T3 (domestic) - particularly with the seamless connection on the Metro. The building itself is quite modern and new, the selection of eateries and shops (both before and after security) is good and there are lots of bathroom facilities near the gates. Our flight was at 2am so the airport was fairly quiet and there were no long queues anywhere, the only issue was that a number of cafes were closed for the night. The need to get a paper tag for each item of hand baggage and have it stamped going through security is a bit of a pain.",7,1
delhi-airport,Kalpesh Ashar,India,The airport is huge but they make you walk all the distance. They advertise free wifi for 45 minutes but unable to connect. Tried with mobile as well as laptop. There is little space to sit near the gates at Terminal 1D. I think they should have paid more attention to the design. ,5,0
delhi-airport,Vishal Shrivastava,India,"Used international terminal and was pretty happy with the overall experience. Quick check-in, clean facilities and surprisingly excellent duty-free and cheap eating options were a nice treat. The only issue was that collecting baggage after arrival is very slow and needs improvement.",9,1
delhi-airport,JAYANT BISWAS,India,"What a terrible sight and experience after returning to India after just 6 weeks out. Moment you step out of the aircraft the personnel, especially the policemen look so sloppy and clumsy. Why do they need to be there even? Immigration and customs were OK, though again the officials look so unprofessional. The toilets are not so clean and the staff look shabby. The operators of the battery carts are not bothered to look out for elderly passengers to give them a ride, what a contrast from the airports where they go out of their way to help elderly passengers. The persons at the eateries are equally sloppy and clumsy in their work and talk. The security staff (police) keep standing in groups and chatting. Their standing poses are so unprofessional. DIAL provides complimentary service to the domestic terminal but they actually only give you a coupon to be used for the regular DTC bus. You have to wait for a long time and the DTC person sitting behind a table is unable to help about the timings, he is busy on his phone even at 1 am! Very depressing to arrive into India. ",5,0
delhi-airport,Indranil Chakrabarty,Australia,"I use this airport frequently and standards seem to have slipped of late. The airport on the whole is great but security staff can be rude and daunting. I was not aware of this 6 hour prohibition of entry before a flight. Like at most third world airports everyone gives a different answer. Staff are helpful but not very professional or organised. It is true that not every staff member is well informed. Keep an eye on the display board for flight timings. I have never experienced erroneous displays leading to missed flights. You should know your flight timings and arrive at the boarding gate in good time avoid missing your flight. Only a fool would wait for a final call announcement over the PA system. However Airline staff would do well to announce delays. My Emirates flight was once delayed for 2 hours hours and the Emirates staff did not bother to show it on the board IGI also needs more flight info screens and for those driving to the city a petrol pump to gas up for the drive to the city. The Metro rail service should be extended to Rajiv Chowk in downtown Delhi. The present service terminates at New Delhi station and one wonders how to travel to the City centre. The shuttle service to the domestic terminal is good. Carry a photo ID when visiting the Airport as you will need to a photo ID for entering the visitors area. DIAL needs to maintain standards. Security checks are a fact of life in India. India unfortunately needs it like mozzie repellent spray. On the bright side despite heavy crowds there are seldom traffic snarls. Taxi booth operators need to be more polite and welcoming. Most things in India start well and then degenerate. It is the same with the Metro link to the City. No traffic wardens and no customer service staff. Regrettably customer service standards at Delhi Airport have fallen and the officialdom is more interested in a ""feedback"" than in fixing things that have gone wrong. Delhi Airport has gone from an A to a B+.",8,1
delhi-airport,J Mandocdoc,United States,"We came to the airport (terminal 3) early hoping to use a Star Alliance Lounge because my wife and I have Gold status and to talk to a Thai Airways rep if we can get on an earlier flight. Instead we are told by security that we cannot enter before 6 hours into the main section of the airport. Instead we are restricted to a ""guest lounge"" section of the airport with minimal AC and flies flying around. We are told to call the customer service number that they have written on a paper for Thai Airways. We call the number and that doesn't work. We then are pointed to a couple kiosks that seem to be 3rd party ticketing agents. As we stand in front of the Celebi kiosk waiting to be helped 5 representatives are sitting make eye contact with us and don't even bother to greet or ask if we need help. We then call the airport customer service line and they contradict what security has been saying and say its 8 hours before the flight that you can enter the main area. I have travelled around the world and this is the first time I've experienced such a rule where you cannot enter the main section of the airport unless its 6 hours from your flight or less. While waiting in front of security in frustration we watch dozens of other foreigners wanting to do the same to enter earlier to talk to a ticket agent or other reasons and see the same reaction. A look of frustration and disgust. You really have to wonder if this airport really cares about what foreigners think and if they'll ever be back as a tourist after experiencing such stupidity and lack of customer service.",,0
delhi-airport,Pankaj Mathur,Qatar,Delhi Airport is extremely clean organized modernized and at par with the international standards. Its the best airport in the Indian subcontinent. I would always prefer to transit from Delhi anytime I come to North India.,9,1
delhi-airport,A Gup,Singapore,Frequently use the International Terminal (T3) at IGIA. In comparison with BKK MNL and even certain Schengen zone airports such as ZRH GVA CDG FCO DEL scores highly. The cleanliness is good. Staff interaction with customers is mixed but DIAL staff on the whole are helpful. Immigration queues are short and generally well managed and quickly dispensed with. Security Checks take time and prove to be a bottle neck but better to be safe than sorry! I don't really shop there but its enjoyable to walk around and browse the shops. Food options seem decent enough lots of veggie options always makes me happy. The vending machines have been known to swallow up hard earned rupees. The biggest drawback is in the arrival lane. it is always chaotic outside. No one seems to be using the tower car park everyone just jams up their cars in the arrival lane. DIAL must look to ensure better traffic management of those cars and persons coming to receive arriving passengers.,8,1
delhi-airport,Diwakar Bista,Nepal,Infrastructure and other facilities are good enough. What do you expect when you are in a connecting flight and our departure airport has checked through your luggage to your destination? Obviously you do not care for it and just collect it at you destination isn't it so? But no not here first of all you need to find the respective airline and give him them your luggage tag and all other information then they will fill in a form and then submit it to transfer desk. If you are provided with a transfer boarding card at the check in counter what do you do? Obviously you go to transit lounge and wait for your flight. But no not here. If you show your transfer boarding card here they simply say that it will not work here. They think boarding cards issued by them are the only ones valid. Getting this boarding card is not easy. During my last trip I had a 12 hour long flight to Delhi and had 6 hour of transit at Delhi and my small 1.5 years old daughter was not feeling well but because of above issues I had to wait for 3 hours just to reach the transit lounge. They need to make the airport passenger friendly.,1,0
delhi-airport,K Emrich,Ireland,Arrived here from Dublin via Abu Dhabi. A week later departed on domestic flight to Goa. Then arrived and transited to flight back to Dublin via Abu Dhabi. When we landed it took a while with the bus to get to terminal. It was early morning in winter so wasn't too hot fortunately. A few flights seemed to have arrived at same time so there was a long queue at immigration. But there were plenty of staff working and they were very polite. Domestic terminal for flight to Goa was a little chaotic. But terminal is bright and clean. Security is heavy but understandable. Good range of cafes in domestic terminal. On return transited from domestic to international terminals. Quite a long distance. Had to wait a long time for bus and it was very cold outside. International terminal was very pleasant experience. We arrived there at 11pm and our flight wasn't until 4am. But we were able to check in early and go through security. Duty free shops had a great selection and very cheap. Walking distances were short enough within the terminals as well. Overall a pleasant experience. And a great contrast to Abu Dhabi which was chaotic overcrowded and very expensive.,8,1
delhi-airport,Vishnu Rai,Australia,Seen many airports around but this one is the best among them. You will never see crowded immigration counters no fussy check-in counters no headache travelling to airport (as you have multiple options). Crowd management is one of the best here. On cleanliness front it can beat any other airport in the world. I found duty-free here much cheaper compared to other airports.,10,1
delhi-airport,Naveen Nath,India,This airport is definitely the best in India and measures up impressively against others such as Istanbul Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur in terms of space cleanliness security eating options and ease of movement. I frequently use both the domestic and international terminals and have not even once found the toilets dirty or smelly. There are always plenty of people ready to help you out in case of doubts. Signage is excellent. The duty free is excellent and definitely offers better bargains than the other airports which I have mentioned and used. The terminal also offers good views of the airside for those interested. The only thing that leaves you confused is the choice of carpet colours!,9,1
delhi-airport,Rohit Raj,India,I have started most of my international journeys through this airport. After having visited several international hubs (LHR CDG DXB AUH SIN HKG BKK KUL CMB) I have to rate Terminal 3 of Delhi Airport one of the best among them. This is a busy airport in terms of flight and passenger volume. Despite this I have never seen this airport very crowded be it check-in counters immigration desk security channel or boarding gates. This is due to the fact that the terminal is very spacious. It has a large number of check-in counters immigration desks and boarding gates. The airport is ultra-modern and very clean. The interiors are great and no less than the interiors of Terminal 3 LHR Terminal 2 SIN or DXB. They have sufficient number of restaurants duty free shops. You are never short of seats once you clear immigration. I hate its traffic which makes the flights wait for longer during take off and keep hovering in air for some time during landing. I think they need to make additional runways functional. Another bad thing about this airport is for transit passengers. If you are transiting through this airport to another destination you may not get proper guidance from staff for new boarding gates. This is mostly to Air India passengers as this airport is the transit hub for Air India. This is the problem of Airline and not the Airport Authority.,8,1
delhi-airport,Suhail Shafi,United States,Terminal 3. Passed through Delhi on my way from the US to a domestic Indian destination. As an overseas Indian I can honestly say this facility makes me proud of my home country. The terminal is ultra modern to and very efficient. Immigration at the airport took me a maximum of 5-10 minutes the shopping is excellent as are the restaurants. Bathrooms are kept extremely clean by staff who are always in the bathrooms to clean up after individual passengers. The staff from the immigration officials to the airline staff are professional and helpful. This airport is up to international standards - a pleasure to fly both in and out of.,10,1
delhi-airport,Ashutosh Garg,India,Delhi Terminal 3 is great. Clean spacious and a lot of food options. Airport staff are friendly. However there are various check points (5-6) which takes some time. Restaurants are fairly priced and I will surely use this airport again.,10,1
delhi-airport,R Puri,Bahrain,I frequently travel through Delhi Airport and in my opinion it is excellent. I don't really understand so many negative comments. Yes the queues can be quite long and security tedious but the actual airport and the facilities are great. Ground staff are friendly and courteous. Immigration do try and speed things up. Security can be a bit rude. There are a lot of shops which offer an immense amount of products. The Duty Free is also of a very high standard. There is also a large food court offering many cuisine's. Toilets are very clean. Lounges offered by the airport are also very good. Overall excellent airport. Not yet up to the standards of Changi and Hong Kong but in my opinion definitely better than lots of Western European/American airports. An excellent new hub for the Star Alliance.,9,1
delhi-airport,S Hermes,Australia,Transit Lounge B of the international terminal - you will sit and wait interminably for someone to take pity on you and issue you your boarding pass for your next flight. It is apparently up to the airline you will board how long they will take to notice you. Two three hour waits are normal in a lounge bereft of anything in the way of amenities except for a vending machine. I would have lodged a formal complaint only the complaint box had no forms and no one would bring me some. A hint to cope with this situation if you have an Indian visa go out through immigration and come back through the check in counter. It will save you hours. Bottom line you certainly do not feel that your status as customer means anything to the staff.,,0
delhi-airport,James Smith,United States,I travel though DEL frequently and have rarely had any troubles with staff. Terminal 3 is enormous and probably better than some ones such as O'hare or JFK. I do agree that there are a high number of security checkpoints but I would rather feel more comfortable being safe than sorry.,10,1
delhi-airport,Alex Chaligne,Canada,"The security at this airport is ""crazy"". You have to go through 8 or 9 security gates even before you get to the check in counter of your airline. We were a couple of hours early arriving at the airport and the security staff wouldn't even let us in. The staff were rude and ask you rude personal questions which are not related to travel. The new terminal T3 which is fairly new but the check in area seemed to be outdated. The floors were dirty and not cleaned properly. Its a big airport handling a good number of passengers every day authorities must take steps to make it passenger friendly rather than scaring them off by their employees and security.",3,0
delhi-airport,G Rafael,Ireland,Worst airport ever. Security is crazy I wet through 8(!) checks. The main proof was a print out email. Security didn't let me in as I was too early. Security and staff rude.,1,0
delhi-airport,Amit Mittal,Kenya,One of my favourite airports. Spacious and efficient. The washrooms are very clean. Areas that need improvement are (1) Duty Free Shopping Variety (2) Acceptance of USD / GBP / AED at the vending machines.,8,1
delhi-airport,Chris Brown,United States,Had a fabulous experience transiting through DEL. Queuing was surprisingly efficient during the early morning hours. Loads of shopping/eating opportunities. I can see this airport becoming a major air hub in the near future. Highly recommended!,10,1
delhi-airport,S Chauhan,Indonesia,Beautiful efficient world class airport. Passengers should acknowledge the fact that the stringent security measures are for good reason. Excellent facilities.,10,1
delhi-airport,V Bhatia,Indonesia,I have traveled almost the entire world and can easily put up my hand and vouch for this airport to be the best. Close second would be the Singapore Changi airport. Excellent modern building with very efficient security measures. I have read reviews here where people have criticized this airport for being too strict but this is for good measure and I think it cannot be ridiculed for it. I have experienced worse (stricter and longer) queues in Heathrow than the T3. The best in the world when it comes to the facilities for passengers with longer transit hours very reasonably priced (compared to it's counterparts in Europe Asia and North America). T3 really is a thrill for any traveler.,10,1
delhi-airport,Paul Harvey,United Kingdom,This relates to T3. We arrived International with a Domestic Connection. Immigration queues were short and did not take as long as last year our baggage arrived reasonably quickly but in order to catch our T3 domestic flight (same terminal) we had to go landside recheck in our bags and then go through landside security. This is stupid and takes a long time - why do they not have airside connections to Domestic we wonder? Hence the three hours connection time we had was only just enough. The airport itself has a reasonable range of facilities there is free wifi but you need a working mobile in order to use it (a security code is sent to your mobile).,6,1
delhi-airport,Saketh Rahm,United States,Used DEL twice in the last week for international arrival and domestic departure. I still think this airport is great after 3 years. Lots of security checks but I would rather have that than be sorry later. Security staff not overtly friendly but their job isn't to be nice but thorough. I like the shopping which is pretty vast and found prices to be fair. Had a nice Indian lunch for Rs 200 ($ 3.50) which is significantly cheaper than a meal at any US or European airport. Boarding areas and bathrooms all clean. Arrival was also easy with 3 lanes reserved for business/first class passengers. Finished customs and immigration in 35 minutes and got a cab to central Delhi on 5 min.,9,1
delhi-airport,Bhargav Nimavat,Canada,Its a truly international standard airport we have been to it recently. I am impressed with the cleanliness of washrooms. World class toilets and staff keep them clean ongoing. Also the sitting facility is good. Food court is clean and food prices are reasonable. Overall I liked the airport and would like to recommend to travellers.,8,1
delhi-airport,D Gill,Canada,DEL T3 is much better than what they had before. It is certainly more pleasant although the carpet color and design seems a bit too loud. The lines did seem a bit longer but nothing that one shouldn't expect. Airport seems to have more choices in terms of restaurants but unfortunately the prices are blatantly high. That is something that they should seriously look at. I think they are using international standards when it comes to pricing. Sadly that is not quite the same when it comes to customer service. I still found washrooms well below par and there were pigeons flying around inside the terminal. If you haven't used DEL before make sure you take the print out of your ticket with you otherwise you will not be allowed inside the terminal. Seems like DEL is the only airport to do that. Although I do understand that they only want to allow the passengers to get inside the terminal. Overall IGI T3 is a big improvement over the old airport but there is a big room for improvement.,5,1
delhi-airport,R Puri,Bahrain,I regularly fly to Delhi Airport. It is an excellent airport with many facilities available. T3 is a lot better than the old airport. Signage is clear and present in all areas of the airport. There are also lots of screens showing flight departures/arrivals. Bathrooms are found in all corners and are extremely clean. A lot of seating is available and there are a lot of shops present at the terminal. Delhi Duty free is very good - lots of products are available. Many good restaurants are in the terminal - serving Indian and international food. however immigrations queues are extremely long and can be a pain. security is also tedious and security staff can often be quite unpleasant. On the plus side airport staff are extremely courteous and helpful. Lounges are also good. The terminal is aesthetically stunning.,9,1
delhi-airport,Mark Wilkins,United Kingdom,In transit from LHR to BKK with Air India. Good points - despite fog no delays except last leg back to LHR by 90 minutes. Clean well laid out airport with good signage and many flight information boards. Toilets clean and well maintained and no sign of cleaners loitering for tips as previous comments. Bad points - international transit. As other reviewers point out this is a slow process with officials taking an inordinate amount of time to do repeated checks. Outbound there was minimal queue (maybe 20 people) but still took 20 minutes to get through. Inbound had 2 flights ahead of me - 60 minutes to get through. For fellow travellers note there are 3 different security checks - ask officials if can go to right if first has a large queue (its not signed or obvious). Also make sure you have baggage tabs on your hand luggage and you get a stamp once your bags are screened - if you do not have this you run the risk of missing your flight depending on the attitude of the staff at the gates (I saw a fellow passenger sent back to get this and she missed the flight to BKK to my knowledge). Long walks between gates so once boarding starts you need to start going to the gate.,7,1
delhi-airport,Indranil Chakrabarty,Australia,Delhi has a nice airport. However make sure you arrive 3 hours before departure. Check in and security checks can take time. Its been Delhi's bane for years. If you need to exchange rupees for foreign currency the choice is not wide and limited mostly to USD and EUROs. There is a Thomas Cook counter close to the entrance and a short walk from check in areas. The airport needs ATMs and Bureau de Change kiosks in the transit and departure lounge following immigration and security. Do not carry a stash of Indian Rupees unless you need to spend it at the airport and exchange them for foreign currency before you go through immigration and security. Or else you could get stuck with Indian rupees on your way out. The Airport seriously needs to think of ATMs and more forex counters in the departure and transit area. Also a Reliance webworld like the one at the old T2 will help. Printers and copiers will be nice too. Surprisingly there is no Business centre at this airport. Very strange. Delhi is slowly getting to be a transit airport so these facilities are called for. The train service to New Delhi railway station is good too. The departure area offers luggage storage for a nominal fee. If you are transiting to the domestic terminal( Low cost carrier terminal which is a few Kms from T3) make sure you have a minimum of 4 hours between flights. Travel to the domestic terminal and queuing at the domestic terminal can eat up a good 2 hours That said IGI Airport is a good airport to travel through. Reasonably clean efficient uncrowded and polite. There is always room for improvement but unlike many airports in the region and in contrast to some overrated 4and 3 star international airports this airport has no nasty surprises.,8,1
delhi-airport,M Steger,Germany,"The best airport in India I have been to there is no bus transfer from domestic to international like BOM still has. Security checks are plenty the cabin luggage screening is a huge mess with shoving and pushing from all sides it is not clear how efficient these checks are and what the purpose of funny paper tags with a stamp on every bag is. If they are so important why are only 2 of our 4 bags actually checked at the time of boarding. Immigration is equally confusing. You are supposed to fill a form nobody tells you that you have to fill it and the form is not available anywhere. Same thing happens when you try to leave the country - you have to plea to a number of staff to actually find out the secret of which other staff member is hiding the forms. The form to leave the country again needs the same information as you gave for the visa application. The Immigration officer then told me it was the duty of the airline to hand out these forms. International to domestic luggage is not checked through even though this was confirmed to me at the time of check-in in BKK by Air India staff. Leaving India it was checked through as well as for international to international transfer. To recheck you bags you have to pick them up and walk them all across the building to some dedicated transfer counters. While walking in the terminal make sure not to stumble over the large gaps in the floor. I was also surprised to find large amounts of staff in washrooms that are labelled ""not for staff"" they are mostly passing time and chatting away. For wifi you can actually select you country to get the password sent to you cell phone but it only worked on 2 out of my 3 times there. Still if you have a choice as to which airport in India you are going to Delhi is probably a good choice.",5,1
delhi-airport,C Cheung,Hong Kong,"Was surprised by the ""random security"" check at this airport. 5 of us after visiting Delhi flew together to Hong Kong using Jet Airways. We spent a long time at the International security check-in counters due to the long queue and only 1 out of 3 counters allowed for ladies it then took over 15 minutes to walk to the appropriate gates. About 30 minutes before the boarding time 3 of us were advised that we were selected by the Custom for random check we were accompanied by Jet Airway staff and walked us all the way back to the security check-in counter with our baggage queue up and checked again as per normal travelers then run back to the boarding gate to catch our plane - luckily just before the door closed. It seems New Delhi Airport is the only one with such special arrangement. Maybe this is one of the various reasons it can only be the second best airport.",5,0
delhi-airport,M Davies,United Kingdom,Strict security so much so that our passport photos were checked three times by the same person at different stages of our passage through. Also as it is not allowed to take Rupees out of the country it would help if Thomas Cook staff would change ones money for you. They seemed most reluctant to change money into sterling trying instead to give Euros or Dollars. Eventually we managed to get Scottish notes as long as we had a minimum of £40 so we had to club together with another traveller. Airside we could only use sterling notes but change would be given in Rupees. How daft is that! The airport itself is a modern building with good facilities but let down by its staff.,5,0
delhi-airport,M Seymour,United Kingdom,First of all I must mention that T3 is an enormous improvement on the old terminal. It is well laid out and very spacious. I'm not sure about the brownish carpet throughout though! With a few improvements mainly in attitudes it might one day achieve the status of some of the better airports like Singapore although I'm not holding my breath. First of all immigration and security staff need to learn manners. Security staff in particular are incompetent and surly. Secondly toilet attendants need to attend to their cleaning duties instead of hovering about trying to extract tips. Thirdly WiFi needs to be free. There is supposed to be free WiFi for 30 minutes. However the PIN code was not fully sent to my mobile phone and as a result I was not able to log on either at the time of my first visit or upon my return visit a fortnight later. Finally FX facilities need to be provided in the departure area after immigration so people have the possibility of converting unused Rupees into an alternative currency since it is not possible to exchange those in one's home country and it would appear taking Rupees out of India is actually illegal!,5,0
delhi-airport,Manav Praveen,Oman,Very good airport. Very nice interiors. Immigration officials not very friendly. One of the best in Asia.,9,1
delhi-airport,A Arora,United Kingdom,I had to use Delhi for domestic and international transfers. The Airport has still got smelly carpet which they need to change. The toilets were clean and better than Heathrow. The security queues at international transfer was really long and as well as the queue for lift to domestic transfers. They need to introduce more lifts to domestic transfers as one lift is not sufficient for international passengers. The food court is impressive and caters for world cuisine. Elderly people have a nightmare at this airport due to long walks. This can be overcome by introducing shuttle services to gates from security gates. The security personal were polite and interactive. Overall I am impressed with Delhi.,8,1
delhi-airport,Ganesh Kumar,India,Another flawless experience at T3. Second trip at this airport this month and overall nothing to complain about. Clean layout functioning clean wash rooms enough to eat and drink - basically whatever one needs from an international airport. Recommended.,9,1
delhi-airport,M Segal,Canada,Terminal 3. Beautiful big efficient airport that works well except for one fatal flaw: the security arrangement in the transit zone. I strongly encourage anyone thinking of flying a route that involves connecting in Delhi to avoid this airport altogether by finding another route. It is massively inefficient slow incompetent and aggravating. The worst airport security set-up I've experienced except for Heathrow Terminals 3 and 4 in London which come a close second. It is under-staffed poorly designed and the people working there are obviously poorly motivated have poor technical training no common sense and no understanding about how to treat passengers like human beings. Yes India has good reason for lots of security but there are better ways of doing it and this is one place to avoid. The poor ratings below relate to the transit security set-up and its effect on the overall airport experience.,,0
delhi-airport,T Jin,United Kingdom,A very busy place. Queuing time very poor almost 2 hrs. Suggest there were more staff to help speed up the process. Bags check and body search very thorough which is good but need to increase staffing.,1,0
delhi-airport,Dhruv Sirsikar,Germany,I have been to this airport on numerous occasions each time my gate is towards the end. The good thing is that there are plenty of travelators all around and getting to the gate gets easy. The complimentary water bottle and newspaper received just before boarding the aircraft is appreciated. Security is tight but I think that is needed plus it gives you a sense of relief when you know that everyone has been checked properly.,9,1
delhi-airport,Tatyana Ramos,United States,"International transfer airside. I transited through Delhi airport on my way to Kathmandu in August. Arrival time was 9.45pm. The Transfer Desk was total chaos with no lines lots of people standing in front of the counter and unresponsive staff. My flight was with Jet Airways. It was not clear who was a Jet Airways rep there. Overall Delhi was disorganized time consuming and unfriendly. On my way back the stop was in Mumbai. Arrival time 5.00 pm. No Transfer Desk here but the Jet Airways staff directed us the whole time. We made a line where our boarding passes were marked ""DT"". The security line was fast. The process in Mumbai was efficient organized and fast. Delhi airport is newer Mumbai is undergoing renovations but the transit process was superior and very good in Mumbai.",5,0
delhi-airport,Saskia Keizer,Netherlands,Travelled in July and August 2013 and had to pass through Delhi airport 3 times for transfers. 3 times it was awful. Took 1.5 hrs to pass security. Checks for hand luggage was so slow. So inefficient. Couples were split up because you had to be completely body searched by a woman in another row. No one speaks English. If you transfer you need at least 2 hours for connecting flights. Security is good but this airport is a mad house.,,0
delhi-airport,John Harris,US Virgin Islands,The airport feels like any of the best airports in the world. It is vast and clean and has enough facilities to keep you occupied no matter how long your lay-over. The security is tight and some of the rules (like having a printout of your boarding pass) may be cumbersome but they do not hassle too much.,10,1
delhi-airport,J Sangha,United States,First trip to Delhi since the new airport opened. Marked improvement over old facility. Good Points: New and clean facility multiple shops and restaurants (most with Indian cuisine). Lines were not too long. Chairs to lie down while you are waiting in T3 terminal. Clean wash rooms Custom check was brief and courteous. Yes they do have Starbucks in T3 terminal. Low Points: Long walks every where from deplaning to custom and on return long haul to the plain. Restricted choice for non Indian cuisine.,8,1
delhi-airport,Ajith Kumar,India,Delhi airport is generally a pleasant experience except for one rotten Apple i.e. the Security check. It it's totally unprofessional manned by inept staff who are more clerical than security staff. Most of the counters are unmanned with more supervisors than actual workers. The inefficiency had to be experienced to be believed. All in all spoils an otherwise decent experience.,3,0
delhi-airport,Prayash Giria,India,Always been a breeze to use. Airside shopping is fairly impressive and diverse as are food offerings. The abundance of air bridges is an added advantage. Baggage claim is quick. Cityside is fairly well organized (and no touts!) and thanks to the airport express getting to the city centre is a breeze. Easily the best in the region and beats other airports I've used like the Paris (CDG ORY BVA) and Barcelona.,9,1
delhi-airport,Ganesh Kumar,India,T3 International. Good clean layout fast immigration checks plenty of eating options and clean toilets. Not much more one can ask for international level airports. Overall a highly satisfying experience.,10,1
delhi-airport,M Hobby,United Kingdom,Transited en route to and from Kathmandu. My First experience of Delhi and I was most impressed. Everywhere clean and spacious with courteous staff. The baggage transit system functioned well with my bag being transferred from my Emirates flight to my Jet Airways flight seamlessly - even though I was not on a through ticket. En route home to Manchester I used the executive lounge where the shower and the food was excellent.,10,1
delhi-airport,Shiroman Singh,United States,IGI Airport was very clean spacious and welcoming to me when I first arrived there. It is a beautiful airport and when you arrive you can tell that a lot of time and hard work was put into building the airport. I would definitely want to travel to IGI again.,10,1
delhi-airport,V Rai,Australia,I can't enough of Delhi airport. Never took me more than 10-15 minutes to get my boarding pass. Immigration did not take more than 10 minutes. Security is where they are very strict though it feels safe when you know that everyone is frisked thoroughly. Lot of shops cafe restaurants to shop and eat. Very reasonable price. Would recommend definitely.,10,1
delhi-airport,Ganesh Kumar,India,Excellent all round experience spacious interiors roomy good food and beverages. Easily one of the best airports around.,9,1
delhi-airport,J Turna,Canada,I was in Delhi Airport in December and January and both experiences were great. Upon arrival from BKK I walked to Passport control and waited about 10 minutes before being cleared. I was impressed with the new terminal (T3). Upon leaving India in January I arrived at the front doors greeted by an armed guard asking for my flight itinerary. I did not have it printed but I showed it to him on my iPhone and had absolutely no issues getting in. Checking in was a breeze and passport control/security was fine. Took about 20-25 minutes to get through so make sure you are there at least 2 hours before in order to get to your plane on time. Once I cleared security I was amazed. This new terminal is like nothing I have seen. Huge beautiful design clean (which is rare in India) a lot of shops and eateries everywhere and very nice staff. I am a smoker and I loved the fact that the smoking room was an enclosure that was outside. About 4 years ago when I came I absolutely hated IGI but this new terminal has changed my mind.,10,1
delhi-airport,Daniel Johnson,United States,"We arrived here via Jet Airways on our way to Singapore. I must say that I was greatly pleased with the hospitality and service. The new T3 is a total game changer for India and the rest of the region. I was there in the early morning hours and it was a very pleasant experience. Staff at several points offered a kind ""good morning"" and a smile. In few years I hope to see them rival airports such as Changi and Incheon (but probably not until the other terminal - T4 is constructed and airline reputation improves) which will improve facilities for domestic flights. The artwork and sculptures inside are just stunning combined with beautiful carpeting. Prices in the duty free are very reasonable and the terminal offers an amazing selection of brands to shop from. Hope to see Mumbai develop into something like this very soon! Great job Delhi! I would happily transit through here next time.",10,1
delhi-airport,Jozsef Barta,Hungary,You need time and patience on this airport plan a lot of time to make your change here. Very important even if you are checked in online you need to get in a line for your boarding pass because your airline is not allowed to let you print out your document. I was told the check-in closes 2 hours before departure I don't know I arrived 25 hours before. When your hand luggage has been screened you get a stamp on your luggage/hand luggage/airline sticker with the date. This stamp will checked before you get on the plane. If you do not have this you are in trouble. So after security you should check your sticker/leaf for the stamp. And you need to get in the line many times. Without air ticket you are not allowed to enter the terminal. For the whole building there are 4 old blind men to check this documents. Imagine how fast this is. Then check is line immigration line security line enter the waiting room designated for your flight than one more old soldier who checks the stamps. I was lucky I did not find any crowd at any time. Every line took me about 3-4 minutes there were only a few international flight out that time (8 am). The terminal is huge to get to your flight you need to walk 2 miles. Many restaurants shops long distances. I found all clean the soldiers were not smiley but friendly.,10,1
delhi-airport,V Ram,India,I have travelled through IGI more times than I can count. Many people complain about the tight security but I feel it is required. The food is relatively expensive. I am not giving a good review just because I am Indian. Generally I am the first person to criticise things in India.,9,1
delhi-airport,A Rana,United States,We were on transit at Delhi airport for 7.5 hours while flying from Kathmandu to Narita. The whole setup is flawed and we were stuck there for more then 2 hours to get a boarding pass. Again - it happened at 6 pm and we waited until 8 pm to get the boarding passes. After getting the pass we went to security check. The guard/police sent us back to the desks to get something called Delhi Transfer (DT) written on our boarding pass. When we returned to the desk the lady wrote down DT using a pen. What a farce! Try to avoid Delhi if possible. There is no service and there were half-a-dozen people doing the job or one or two max.,3,0
delhi-airport,Tapani Utunen,Finland,Have travelled a few times through T3 and every time the experience has been quite good and hassle-free. This time arrived at 5.30 am from Helsinki and connected to an Air India domestic at 9 am. Bags were out quickly and immigration was a breeze then quickly upstairs to Air India departures with a security check on the way upstairs - we were at the Air India counter by 6.30 am and had plenty of time until AI departure that was on time. The same story on the way back to Helsinki: easy and hassle-free. Maybe this is due to the fact that Finnair lands in Delhi in the morning instead of midnight and takes off at 10.45 am when there is not that much international traffic at T3. Moreover there are some pleasant eateries and cafes there plus great views to the runways to do some plane spotting. Cannot understand some very negative feedback from fellow travellers about Delhi Int'l Airport. Sure Delhi cannot compete with Hong Kong Singapore Changi KLIA or Bangkok Suvarnabhumi but it's still modern bright rather functional and clean. Security is tight but when you know this beforehand you shouldn't encounter any major problems at Delhi Int'l Airport.,9,1
delhi-airport,A Syed,Australia,Visited this airport only once and I have to say by far the worst experience ever. Seats broken limited facilities very tight security (especially for us Pakistanis) and a very dirty airport. Stopped there for 3 hours and couldn't bear a minute within the airport at all.,1,0
delhi-airport,Paul Harvey,United Kingdom,We arrived here on a Virgin flight and generally the airport experience was ok. It took about 35 minutes to get through immigration but the queue was constantly moving albeit slowly. There were plenty of free baggage carts available and clean free toilets although in both cases it did not stop an airport employee trying to get a tip because we wanted to use the free service. Our bags were on the belt when we got through immigration and leaving the airport was easy. We then flew internal from T3 and it was surprisingly easy and orderly. Very short queues pleasant staff and seats in the waiting area for our delayed flight. The drive from central Delhi to the airport took about 30 minutes but the roads were relatively jam free for Delhi on a mid Monday morning. Arriving back a few days later at the Domestic Terminal we were quickly bussed to the terminal our luggage arrived within minutes (it was a full jet so we were prepared for a long wait) and we were quickly out of the terminal past the numerous food stalls outside. Departing from T3 a couple of days later to London was a struggle. Check-in was fast but the queue for immigration took 30 minutes and that for security took nearly an hour – the problem being not enough staff on duty for all of the scanners (and this was at a peak departure time). From arriving at the airport to getting to the gate to 2 ¼ hours. Once airside it was calm and peaceful and we took off on schedule.,5,1
delhi-airport,Indranil Chakrabarty,Australia,Signage is a bit of a problem at Delhi Airport T3. Also the flight information display at the Departure level does not show Arrivals and vice versa. The Radisson Hotel in Mahipalpur where those transiting through Delhi often rest and relax has no flight info displays. Same with the low cost airline terminal. However the Airport is big and spacious and the roads leading to the airport wide and traffic free. A far cry from the former T2.,9,1
delhi-airport,B Brierley,United Kingdom,I've been twice in the last 3 months and it is 2 times too many. I avoid coming to India as much as possible just because of the experience at the airport coming back. The security staff think that the airport is a prison and not a service. The first time I assumed since my airline allowed me to have my boarding pass on my phone/email that I could print it out at the check in or service counters. This is a big mistake as some people have already said. Armed guards will not allow you into the airport without this piece of paper. You can print in an office next to the airport if you have cash. Second time I learned that even with a printed boarding pass it is not enough. If you have no luggage (just hand luggage) you still need to queue for another boarding pass. Both situations could have been avoided by clear communication at time of checking in or at the airport. Leave plenty of time for queuing. You will queue to get into the airport to get your boarding pass to get through passport check to get through security military-style to get through security airline-style oh and there is one final check at the gate of the plane. On Friday I saw somebody refused past that check because there laptop bag had a security tag but no security stamp. I'm not opposed to queuing but the hostility is incredible and the process is slow. I have a lasting memory of seeing 3 booths out of 10 occupied with long queues. One of these the guy was having a nap with his legs on the desk. Somehow if you believe the hype this airport has a great rating. I think it's a horrible experience.,1,0
delhi-airport,Khalid Nadeem,Saudi Arabia,I have travelled through T3 thrice and luckily each experience had been great. The airport is huge swanky and gives an impression of modern India a truly world class airport. The only thing I regret is the security staff wish they get versed in English language and learn how to be chivalrous and genteel with the passengers. Rest it's an overall great experience with nice shops eateries prayer area and other facilities. The airport was a huge surprise. Impressive gateway to Delhi!,9,1
delhi-airport,Sunil Maheshwari,Canada,Very good experience overall reading some of the people's review regarding security too tight? I rather be safe than sorry. Food was great and prices were reasonable. Some people complaining about prices compare them to Frankfurt or London! We were out in less then hour incl our duty free shopping. Best prices on duty free!,9,1
delhi-airport,Y Ren,Australia,I have been through Delhi airport International and Domestic departure and arrival recently. I am impressed with the facilities better than I expected. At international arrival hall staff are helping people to get luggage I was impressed with their professionalism and helpful attitude. Domestic arrival hall is bit different no staff helping people with luggage still very smooth process. Both international and domestic departure process are similar with other international airports. Here are the downsides. Security is very very tight at Delhi airport. I can understand the reason why but surely these security staff could be more professional and friendly. They are just simply rude! Wifi is only for Indian mobile phone holders they could at least learn from Chinese airport to get temp password if you present your passport. All food and other products are pretty expensive for Indian standard. End of the day it is the people make you feel good not a big departure hall!,5,0
delhi-airport,Abhishek Kumar,Canada,While coming from Canada to India I faced three major issues. 1 Being an international airport they expect you to have a mobile connection for wifi access. How do they expect an international traveller to have a mobile connection. Having visited 5-6 international airport around the world I have never seen such restriction. 2 A long queue at immigration always see officers busy chatting with each other. 3 The food is extremely expensive. They should keep the price in accordance with Indian price range. 4 Cleanliness etc. are good but above shortcomings were big enough to make me ignore them.,2,0
delhi-airport,Michael Hobby,United Kingdom,I transited Delhi on 19th October and 11th November en route to and from Kathmandu. I can only say that I was most impressed. The airport is clean and well laid out and the staff are polite and courteous. On my return journey I availed myself of the executive lounge where I was able to enjoy a refreshing shower followed by a satisfying meal.,6,1
delhi-airport,Purnima Nish,United Arab Emirates,In short Delhi airport has been a short and a sweet experience for me in comparison to other airports around the world that look more like a shopping complex than an airport. In my experience it took me less than 30 mins to get out of the airport not a single queue until luggage collection point. I like departures security at the airport gates do not allow any unnecessary people to enter the airport except travellers. Staff helpful and friendly. At check-in they provide help with your luggage. Before you go for immigration there are at three points where you are told about immigration forms. A short and a nice collection of duty free with food court.,10,1
delhi-airport,David Smith,Ireland,"Transited Varanasi-Delhi-London. On arrival at the domestic terminal there are no signs to the international terminal. You have to follow a worn line on the floor to a wooden desk outside the terminal where an airport employee (not wearing a uniform or an ID) inspects your onward ticket and writes you a chit. You then take the chit and walk to an unmarked bus stop (beside a bridge in the open air) where a shuttle bus takes you to the international terminal. The shuttle bus has its quota of scam artists who try to ""help"" you with your luggage and then demand a tip. On arrival at the international terminal you have to show your ticket to the Indian army personnel just to get inside (we had to try to get in three times as the soldiers at the first two gates had apparently never seen BA tickets before). You must also go through another five security checks as well as running the gauntlet of Indian immigration. By a long shot the worst airport I've ever had to transit though.",2,0
delhi-airport,A Schoenmakers,Netherlands,Terminal 3. Facilities are okay and washrooms are constantly cleaned. Food court is okay the food court in domestic departures has more choice than the food court in international departures which is strange. My main negative point is the attitude of the security and immigration staff. They treat you as a 'thing' and don't speak a word to you. Seems like they don't know the basic words like 'hello' 'please' 'thank you'. If I were airport management I would give them some training sessions communication and people skills!,7,1
delhi-airport,Saketh Rahm,United States,Very impressed with this airport having used it twice in the last 2 weeks. Roads leading up to it clean and free of traffic check in process for both domestic and international flights well demarcated and easy with few lines. Security took about 5 minutes. Each time security staff said thank you and have a safe flight which I thought was nice. Shops were great and the staff helpful. Airport has lots of eateries from all over the worlds with reasonable prices. Found the lounges to be very nice. It is very large with lots of walking but it is clean and there is a boarding gate for every flight- certainly better than any US airport and most European ones.,9,1
delhi-airport,N Singh,India,Have been in and out of DEL several times in recent past. Queues at immigration always lesser than airports outside India. Washrooms always clean although are used by security staff and other staff as well. Eating choices good and affordable considering that airports in general are expensive world over. Ample space and no sensation/risk of bumping into people unlike several major airports in the world.,8,1
delhi-airport,Patrick Tan,Malaysia,It did not matter to me how big or new Indira Ghandi Airport was to me I was not impressed at all. The airport was a major disappointment to anyone using it. The attitude of the workers at the airport is horrible. Check-in workers will just throw your bags on to the belt in front of you. Immigration lines are ridiculous. Locals and foreigners are queuing up together. Locals were mostly cutting through the line and making the line so confusing and packed up that it did not look like a line. No one was there to control the line and immigration workers refused to do anything about it. There was just no system to it. I was glad to leave the airport.,2,0
delhi-airport,C Chetri,United States,The Transfer area is horrible with no food stalls and no money exchanges. There must be around 50 chairs and when there is more than 1 flight people wait there for 5-6 hrs standing to get to the transit area. There is no customer service. I travelled with my mother from USA and after taking a 17 hrs flight we had a horrible experience. The employees treat you as though they are doing a favour by giving you the ongoing boarding pass or answering any questions.,2,0
delhi-airport,Rajiv Singal,India,I frequently use Delhi airport and its terminals 1D and 3 are quite modern compared to old 1A 1B and 2. Security check procedure is still old-school but its much better managed now than before. Terminal 3 is quite long and maybe it could have been better designed to reduce walking time to gates. Further it feels more closed than open and maybe they could improve on natural lighting. Terminal 1D is quite fantastic given everything is fast-track but it lacks facilities as compared to even Terminal 3. In both the terminals they need to improve on maintenance.,8,1
delhi-airport,Tariq Hashmat Tauheed,India,I expected a lot from this airport. It looks more of an airport built within a shopping mall. The immigration- and-security check area combined is half of the entire commercial and food area. It took me 65 minutes to get through immigration and security check due to the long queues. I think IGI and GMR lost out on prioritizing the facilities. People don't visit airports for fun and shopping they travel through them and the top priority should be passenger convenience which is in no way top notch.,2,0
delhi-airport,Kam Bharath,United Kingdom,Travelled to terminal 3 compared to terminal 2 this is brilliant. Large concourse for being dropped off in and entry to the airport was fine - didn't have to queue and security staff was quite pleasant. Check-in was fine no real issues. Had to deposit 3 of our 4 bags in the oversize bags area which were taken by a 'porter'. Immigration is normally an ordeal but in this case no problems at all! The final security check was great the guy doing the pat downs greeting us with a smile and we were done. Wide range of food in the food court and competitively priced duty free items. The reason I suppose is the airport wasn't as busy as it could be and perhaps that accounted for the pleasantness of staff?,8,1
delhi-airport,B Dsouza,United States,There were mosquitoes everywhere I can only imagine how bad it gets during the rainy season. The restrooms were a bit better than some other Indian airports or in India in general but they still smelled and each bathroom could use a dedicated janitor. At immigration two of the guys were busy talking when one of the other immigration officials asked me to go up to them. I did and I was yelled at! The places to eat looked dirty. If given the choice again I would stay away from this place.,1,0
delhi-airport,P Banga,United Kingdom,I flew to Delhi and then an internal transfer to Amritsar. Rude staff long delays at security and very rude security staff zero customer service. No point having wonderful facilities if the whole process takes so long that you have no time to sit down at the airport! Very stressful. Same story on the way back.,1,0
delhi-airport,D Cresswell,United Kingdom,"Very modern airport very efficient with short queues. Great food court at departures. But the BA lounge service was the worst I have encountered. Subcontracted over-crowded poor refreshments and no privacy. There was much more room to ""stretch out"" in the public food court area.",9,1
delhi-airport,A Boone,Nepal,Based on a recent flight from Kathmandu to Sudan via Delhi (return via Mumbai). It's probably fine if you have boarding cards right through but if not then forget it. We were sat for over 5 hours in a transit area in Delhi with nothing but vending machines which only accept Indian rupees (and nowhere to change money). By the time we got through another 40 minutes in security there was barely enough time to get anything to eat. Same story in Mumbai on return except that the transit area was alive with mosquito's and we just about made it to our plane with a 3 hour transit time. I can't really rate terminal facilities as we barely had a chance to see the departure area.,3,0
delhi-airport,N Singh,United Kingdom,Visited the airport twice in Feb 2012. If you are transferring from Dehli to any other airport in India - don't. We had a 2 hour wait in Delhi Terminal 3 which was taken up by rushing from corner of the airport to the other. There were security checks baggage which had to be checked in again more security checks and long queues and disinterested and unhelpful staff. We managed to board our connecting flight just in time. On the way back from Amritsar to Dehli to London Heathrow. Same story long queues followed by security checks and more checks. For all the new facilities and modern airport Dehli knows nothing about customer service and providing a good experience.,2,0
delhi-airport,Michael Shoesmith,United Kingdom,This Airport is extremely regimental. Six Security checks! Security check to get in to Departures At the desk Immigration Border control at the gate and before entering the plane. X-ray staff had a chat whilst ignoring my rucksack that was sitting making me wait. No signage. Duty free staff are disinterested and was greeted with a sour serious face of have a nice flight.,2,0
delhi-airport,A Pal,Canada,I visited India after about two years and used the new T-3 terminal for the first time. I have to say I was impressed with the facility. But obviously because of its size one has to walk a lot although there are moving walkways. I just wish they had chosen a different color carpet it seems so tacky and old fashioned. Most importantly the queues seemed shorter and staff more helpful. The food a bit overpriced. What remains to be seen is that how long can they maintain the high standards.,8,1
delhi-airport,A Singh,Japan,Visited Delhi after 3 years and noted a lot of improvements. Clean passageways a bit of a long walk to arrival area perhaps because of its size clean toilets with staff to help immigration and customs was a breeze without any problems. After disembarking I was out of the main gate in just 25 mins. There is room for more cleanliness and maintenance otherwise in a few years it will be just the same as before.,7,1
delhi-airport,A Husain,United Kingdom,From LHR by Air India. Queues longer than expected. A lot of the airport staff were rude I guess it really is luck what kind of person you get at the kiosks. Airport was clean and there was a good range of duty free shops at reasonable prices. There were plenty of signs making it impossible to get lost. Check-in and baggage claim were easy but immigration took ages. Toilets were nice. Lots of screens updating you on your flight at all times. Overall Terminal 3 was so much better than Terminal 4 at Heathrow.,8,1
delhi-airport,Jayant Jalan,India,I have experience of Domestic Terminal 1D. The design was good and we never felt it was the clichéd substandard Indian Airport. The baggage was at the belt within 5 minutes of arrival. The help desk was large and other signage pretty clear. On the city side there are good food and beverage outlets within and in the area outside the terminal. Access to ATM's and Taxi booths were good. However a better signage and guidance system ought to be put in place to avoid confusion to Non Locals. Most Important it was wheelchair friendly. The placement of baggage belts were too close for my comfort. The use of LCD screens could be better with more efficient information. Wifi was weak wen I visited.,8,1
delhi-airport,Sam Sawhney,United Kingdom,I used the airport to transit from international to domestic. The queues on international arrivals are not long and check out was quick but luggage collection took bit longer. On return trip the international airport had big immigration queues. If passengers want to do shopping then check in at least 5 hrs before departure time as it takes longer to get all the formalities done and gates are at very far distance from immigration. The airport is full of all sorts of shops but no point if you are checking in just 3 hours before the flight time. There is no sign of small transportation vehicles to take the able bodied passengers to gates. The passengers were just rushing to their gates in order to catch their flights after security check. The seating area near the gate are clean and coffee shops are around each gate. The toilets were clean in line with international standards. The ground staff of airport is more helpful than the other airports and to my surprise no money was demanded from travellers as we needed the wheelchair at last minute.,8,1
delhi-airport,T Phukan,Singapore,Delhi-Singapore-Delhi this week and discovered that Terminal 3 was very impressive - equipped with all modern facilities - clean good ceiling height and friendly immigration staff. But there are areas where it can improve - properly trained and professional staff. Let us not have CISF people - most of them are rude. It will be good to have a force specially trained for Airport security - who can be friendly and strict at the same time. There are many good shops - mostly international brands. The toilets were clean - but could be cleaner.,7,1
delhi-airport,G Penumarti,New Zealand,Dubai-Delhi-Dubai. Arrival in to Delhi at Terminal 3 was a pleasant surprise it was clean and spacious and looked quite modern. It took 10 mins to reach immigration and I went to get my visa on arrival at the desk which was deserted. It took two approaches to the immigration officials to get someone to come to the desk and process my request and took a further hour for me to obtain my visa. It took approximately 1.5 hrs to finally reach the exit which could have been faster had the visa arrival desk been manned. Beyond this everything else was very good. Return from Delhi to Dubai travelling with an elderly passenger. I had made arrangements with airline for a wheelchair I would recommend avoiding the paid porter service unless it is required. The steward who accompanied us with the wheelchair was helpful and stayed with us right till boarding. Overall it was a pleasant experience and I was impressed with Terminal 3.,8,1
delhi-airport,Andrew Bent,United Kingdom,"Facilities in Departure Lounges - both domestic and international - excellent but the system of making transit pax sit in the ""visitors lounge"" until the security guard chooses to allow you through to check-in might mean you don't have a lot of time to appreciate them. The Visitors Lounges themselves are awful - they don't even have toilets. I was stuck in one for over 12 hrs and was not impressed.",5,0
delhi-airport,V Vedi,United Kingdom,Initial impressions are good. Indira Ghandi International Airport is a modern world class airport. However it is let down by the security. There are checks to get into the airport checks to get to check-in checks to get to passport control and the massive queues at passport control and through security. Whilst most modern airports and airlines suggest check-in 3 hrs before an international flight you need closer to 5 if you want to shop or use a lounge. It is ludicrous!,3,0
delhi-airport,Paras Deo,Germany,Very loud. Most of the announcements are unnecessary and irritating. Apart from that why do they have to announce the 'departure' and the 'arrivals' of all flights? How does that information help any passengers waiting for the flights. It functions with minimum announcements all over they world so why not at DEL?,7,1
delhi-airport,A Kumar,India,The new terminal T3 is a vast improvement from the old one. Mostly the facilities are fine just about what you would expect as minimum from any modern city airport. However what really exasperates is the security - their objective seems to be to harass the traveler. The awful looking carpets are a bother to drag luggage over it. Other than this an acceptable airport.,3,0
delhi-airport,D Taylor,United Kingdom,If you are not in transit it is airy modern and there is plenty of space. The security checks are frequent and time consuming. If you are in transit- make sure that your bag has been offloaded. I was told at Heathrow that my bag would be booked through Delhi to Bangalore - it was offloaded at Delhi. An announcement 5 mins before my connecting flight was the only information I had which was too late - connecting flight departed and I spent hours being passed from one uninformed official to another each stamping bits of paper etc. Eventually retrieved my bag thanks to the airline representative - not the airport officials. Wasted 6 hours at Delhi.,3,0
delhi-airport,Naveen Nath,India,It has everything several check-in counters security gates bright natural lighting during the daytime shops and areas to lounge and dine. The distances one has to walk is not a problem unless travelling with an infant or older traveller. Windows airside do not give you a good view of the flight operations if you are waiting. On the city side hailing a taxi can be confusing with different lanes for different types of taxis. Similarly making your way to the Metro Station is not easy and locating the Coach boarding point is not easy.,4,0
delhi-airport,B Weiser,United Kingdom,Its clean and the queues were practically non-existent when I went through (they seemed to be manning more counters than there were customers both at check-in and immigration. Yes I agree with some people that the staff have not been trained as well as at other airports and many don't seem to know anything or just want to pass you on to someone else but in general everything at this new terminal is self-explanatory. I found the signage to be clear and sufficient.,5,0
delhi-airport,Mark Segal,Canada,A nice modern building full of rude staff and a terrible lack of co-ordination for passengers in transit. One can wait a long time at the transit desk to be given boarding cards to proceed through security to the departure area and lounges - even Business Class passengers are caught-up in this inefficient mess that can last for hours. The security screening area beyond the transit counter is small and congested with long lines. The quality of the business lounges is generally poor unless you're in the Plaza lounge. Other lounges are exposed to the concourse therefore noisy and insufficiently air-conditioned.,1,0
delhi-airport,Duncan Anderson,United Kingdom,Quite impressed with the shiny new airport that came with the Commonwealth Games. A few quirks though. Last place to change money is before security and the retail outlets after don't give great rates. There also seemed to be far more security (6 passport checks) than I've ever experienced.,4,0
delhi-airport,Prayash Giria,India,Used both the domestic and international wings of T3 and never been disappointed. Having seen CDG and BCN DEL is impressive. Special mention to baggage arrival which was very quick and the airport express train is very useful. Never transited so can't really comment on that but as far as point to point flights are concerned DEL is an excellent airport.,5,0
delhi-airport,Saurabh Sinha,India,Suprisingly I found Delhi's IGI better than most of the European and American airports. On my way from ORD and transfer to domestic was smooth and hassle free. Courteous staff good food court and decent duty free. Delhi needed this and now they have it.,5,0
delhi-airport,Karthik Nimmagadda,India,T3 living up to my expectations. New Delhi was requiring such a Fast transport Airport from many years. Thanks to GMR this dream has been engineered. Yet Some reasons make the International Standards feel and Look like National / Urban. Especially The Check out of multi-level parking. The Single Lane run to Exit from Multi-Level Car parking is Absurd. There is a 15min allowance from Payment to Exit time. This Time gets 200% Consumed in the Waiting lane on the Exit path of Multi-level Car parking. The Lane should have been Widened more.,3,0
delhi-airport,Indranil Chakrabarty,Australia,Recently travelled to Dubai on Emirates and was pleasantly surprised by the new terminal 3. Modern clean efficient and crisp. Not comparable to KLIA or Dubai or ORD but a big improvement over the dump (old terminal 2). The staff are efficient no one asked for a tip or bribe. Immigration staff helpful though they take their time. Airport staff definitely polite and friendly. Airtel has a phone bank for free calls to the city. Helpful when you've just landed and don't have local SIM card. Mobile phone kiosk (Airtel) provides sim that cranks up in minutes. There is a Left luggage counter next to the Metro station and staff there are helpful. Downside: Food court pricey. Not much in the way of duty free shops. Immigration still takes times especially at peak hours (Late night & early morning ). Cant tell where the int terminal ends and domestic begins. Prepaid Taxiwallahs mostly courteous. Don't expect flash sedans. ( Some cabs are rickety old Ambassadors) Can do with a few more bureau de change kiosks in the arrival area. More Int dep and arrival info displays needed right around the terminal. If you are flying out of Delhi ALWAYS carry your printed e-ticket or they wont let you in. Carry Indian rupees if you want to snack in the food court. They don't take USD or credit cards. Delhi airport has come a long way and is way ahead of many airports in Asia and the Middle East. Give credit where credit is due.,5,0
delhi-airport,M Gill,United States,I am originally from India myself and sadly Delhi and any airport in India for that matter leaves much to be desired. So far I have not used the new T-3 terminal because I have not been back since 2009. Seems like everything that happens there is chaotic from line-ups to get into the airport to boarding your flight. A few things I should warn you about specially if you've never been there before make sure you take your online flight schedule/ticket etc with you. I know it is only a printed piece of paper but the security personnel don't allow you inside unless you have it. No one is allowed inside the terminal unless he/she has a flight and they want to see the proof. Oh yes be ready to be checked at least three four times. Be ready to be approached by employees (from cleaners to policemen) asking for well let me just say some tip. Feel free to say a firm no. While trying to resolve something try to get to the highest possible official. One more thing don't expect any smiles greetings and or hellos (unless the other person is about to be paid).,2,0
delhi-airport,Jean Joseph,Canada,One of the worst experiences by far that I've ever had in an international airport. Indian government has put a lot of effort into bringing this airport up to par with international standards and it shows in the infrastructure and amenities. Good job to them for that. BUT aside from the infrastructure what really disappointed me and hoards or other passengers around me was the lack of discipline of airport staff lack of knowledge of airport operations and in some cases even their lack of knowledge of English at all. I am an Indian by descent but never had the exposure to learn Hindi over the years. In many instances the immigration and security personnel refused to converse with me in English and kept asking questions in Hindi and looking at me when I did not have a reply. I came in on a connection flight and was flying out to Toronto. I had a total transit time of 2 hrs for the next flight. Although there were numerous staff walking around none were able to assist me in finding my next checkin counter despite my frenzy to catch the next flight. They even had the nerve to tell me that they do not work for the airline and to try and find someone who does. Extremely rude. Finally when I found the checkin counter myself and after waiting 30 mins in line the guy behind the counter tells me I have to fill in some form. When I enquired where to find the form without even lifting his head up says it should be lying around on the counter somewhere. The moment the gate opens its like every man for himself and no order at all. What I don't understand is past the gate and on the walk to the flight there must have been at least 5 points where you are stopped again and asked for passports. I finally thanked my stars when my flight took off and promised myself to pay extra $$ in the future to fly through any other airport but Delhi. I have seen very small cities that have far more organized airports and courteous staff than Delhi.,1,0
delhi-airport,Tapani Utunen,Finland,Changed planes from domestic to international. The airport itself is impressive and a huge improvement compared to the old terminal but the security checks between domestic & international and international and international are badly planned and badly organised: a narrow area with typical chaos endless lines etc. You need 2-3 hrs between flights to get on your next flight even in the daytime when the airport is not busy. The shopping areas are large airy and comparable to many international airports. Moreover we liked the local touches in the interior design very much. If you just have time to enjoy these features due to the badly organised transit and security arrangements.,4,0
delhi-airport,R Krishnan,India,Domestic departure airport is huge and one has to be prepared for a long trek. The shopping area is pleasant prices comparable to a mall. Check in took 10 minutes and likewise for security.,4,0
delhi-airport,G Boothman,United Kingdom,Arrival smooth and unhindered. Immigration a breeze with plenty of desks open. Luggage arrived within 5 mins of getting to collection area. Departure at T3 also easy. Security prior to the terminal and at the entrance was high but courteous. Check in and information highly visible. Security checks inside quick but not very impressive. The waiting areas are new so look good and there are a good selection of shops and eating places. The place was also very clean which for India is something of a plus.,4,0
delhi-airport,S Datta,United Kingdom,"I used T3 on four occasions over the past two weeks domestic and international arrivals and departures. Immigration for me has never taken more than 10 minutes. The domestic side I found to be very well supplied with places to eat/drink/shop (felt much more ""complete"" and bustling than the International side). There were a number of good food options in the food court and some good book/magazine buying options. In addition at the domestic exit they now have postpaid Radio Cabs - ie. you pay by the meter for radio cabs Rs 25 per km + Rs 80 airport charge. Not sure if they've switched to post paid at the international side too - but for the previous comment who was complaining about the range of fares to Defence Colony I wonder if s/he was comparing air-con radio cab prices (about twice yellow-and-black cab fare) to old non-a/c-yellow-and-black cab fares - since the former would be around Rs 600 for Def Col and the latter Rs 300. International departures smooth. Check-in/security quick long walk to the gate but place to relax once there. The two things which remain an annoyance are the insistence on printouts at entry and the penchant for stamping tags on every piece of hand luggage both of which I hope someday disappear.",5,0
delhi-airport,A Lieder,United Kingdom,This airport is a zoo and best avoided. It looks impressive from the outside but that is all. Arrival was not too painful - 1 hour queue in immigration then another 30min for luggage. The Forex counters have poor rates. Prepaid taxi counters appear to charge what they want - from 600ruppes down to 300 rupees for a car to Defence Colony and are pretty unhelpful - not the most hearty welcome for the first-time India visitor so it is worth to shop around despite what they will tell you. The return was a nightmare. At first security personnel (police) man every possible point in the airport. They are rude and speak almost no English. If you can show no ticket they will not let you into the terminal building. My husband did not have a printout of his e-ticket and was refused entry. Luckily I had printed mine out and was able to go in and on to teh Air France counter to stomp my feet ( and Air France personnel was helpful to be fair - but security and ground staff appear to be completely separate). More hassle at the security check (again mannned by police) - as a woman I was only allowed to pass a metal detector about half a mile from where i had left my hand luggage (and the boarding pass). Security stamp your boarding card for a reason unknown to me. More police by the gate again checking boarding passes and on the walkway onto the airplane. At that point I was happy to see the back of them. Airside shops are pretty poor - don't wait to buy last minute souvenirs there. Duty free choice below average with prices higher than average (compared to small city European airports). Food choices abysmal - only spotted a branch of Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf the insipid Singaporean Coffee Shop Chain charging 150 rupees for a small cappuccino. Seating is hard plastic - at present you are better off lying on the hideously coloured carpet and staring at the cheap looking prefab ceiling.,2,0
delhi-airport,D Letch,United States,Do not transit via Delhi. Regardless of amount of time you have during transit you will end up spending 90% of the time at the transit area. I had heard about the problems at the old airport but I was hoping that they would have implemented new transit policies for the new airport - wrong. During inbound and outbound flights I was able to get out of the transit area mere 45 mins before my flight. And if you have a long layover you are stuck in this place with one small food stall where food is bad. No where else I have ever had to spend pretty much locked up like in a jail cell during transit. Even though they have build a nice looking airport the ones transiting via Delhi will never get to explore the airport taste some Indian food purchase gifts and so forth.,1,0
delhi-airport,David Leston,United Kingdom,IGI's new Terminal 3 is a massive improvement on Terminals 2 and 1D. It's really impressive and easy to use although the carpeting throughout is hideous. Why carpet? Why the vile 1970s design? My concern is that it will all deteriorate very quickly and will end up looking just as bad as other Indian airports - give it 10 years. Why don't the Indian airport authorities believe in on-going maintenance?,4,0
delhi-airport,D Cooper,United Kingdom,London to Bangkok via Delhi - big mistake. On outward journey did not get 2nd leg boarding card was told would get this in Delhi transit - this is chaos taking forever. Had a 4 hour transit stop so no big deal. Foodc ourt many restaurants used rupees that I had from a previous visit to India. On return same scenario confusion at transit gate. I wanted to eat but now only had euro or swiss currency - small curry stall would not take except rupees - McDonalds the same. Went to Thomas Cook foreign exchange but they only change for Indian passport holders!,1,0
delhi-airport,M Rahman,United Kingdom,"The new airport is aesthetically pleasing and impressive. However the airport is yet to be completely finished with shops still in the process of being built with incessant hammering and drilling. Duty free shops expensive and selection is not extensive. Ground airport staff need to be trained to be more professional and take responsibility to answer queries rather than just shrugging and answering in the negative more often than not. The airport boasts wi- fi access but this is only available to pax with Indian mobile connections and not available to those with international ones. On enquiring about this wi-fi issue a senior staff member answered ""Its your problem not mine"" - very customer friendly indeed. Overall a nice airport good for spending an hour or two but frankly I am bored of it already. It is one of South Asia's better airports - but dont compare it to Changi or HKIA Indira Gandhi Intl does not come close to either of the two.",4,0
delhi-airport,S Datta,United Kingdom,The arrivals experience was smooth - a long walk from the gate to the immigration area but there were many travelators made it quite painless. The height of the ceilings and general sense of space is wonderful. Immigration was smooth: took less than a couple of minutes between arriving and getting through. I had no checked luggage so cannot comment on the wait time for luggage - which I've heard can be very long. Once outside there was no wait for a radio cab which got me home in less than 25 minutes was prepaid and smooth. I ended up spending quite a bit of time in Departures on the way out because I got there a bit early and passport control/security was quick. Entry smooth; the outside area feels very open and spacious people seeing you off can hang out for some time if they like. Inside once past security there is a pretty good range of shops including a couple of boutiques stocking Indian designers a bookstore or two decent duty free a good restaurant (branch of the Smokehouse Grill in South Delhi I think) several coffee places and a very nice food court on the upper level. Again it all feels very spacious and unhurried and relaxing. The wifi access was one problem: it requires you to have an Indian cellphone number for an activation code to be sent to - not a great idea for international travellers! The gate area has these chaise longue to lie down on. Not much else to do at the gate areas though. I hope they add a few shops eating places and so on over time (Having said that it feels wonderfully uncluttered for an airport a rarity these days!),4,0
delhi-airport,Ian Jenkins,Germany,Recently transferred at New Delhi airport on flights to and from Kathmandu. Had plenty of time for transfer which is needed due to long corridors taking up to 15 minutes to get to the central area. All transfer passenger must go through security which was quite efficient and to the central area before going back down the corridors to the gate area. It is important to make sure checked bags are recorded so the get on the next flight. The main terminal area looked very impressive at first site however a closer look reveals poor workmanship like cracked tiles torn carpets etc. Ongoing construction is unfortunately destroying much of the floor space. Terminal catering quite good and we thought reasonably priced (but maybe high for India).,4,0
delhi-airport,S Srinivasan,United States,Used the new T3 international terminal during a recent trip. You no longer have to deal with the masses outside the entrance doors much more space to move around the check-in area and the security check has been moved to immediately after immigration meaning you no longer have to worry about missing your flight due to security if you go to the lounge. The main terminal area is much nicer than the old one though as another poster has noted the shops are overpriced lounges are nicer as are gate waiting areas. Queue control also seems to be better though I was leaving on a Saturday night when traffic seemed pretty light. Alas there are still some teething problems. My main complaint was the shuttle service from the domestic terminal (1D) to the international terminal. The bus itself is fine but you're dropped off at the very bottom level where there are no luggage carts to be found. This forces you to lug your heavy bags up a seemingly endless series of travelators to the 3rd level - no easy feat when you're tired. There is still insufficient place to sit if you arrive too early to check in for your flight. And although Wi-Fi is free you must have a working mobile phone to obtain a password by SMS - a big problem if you're a visitor without an international-enabled phone. They don't even offer a pay option anymore. And finally I don't care for the gate setup - similar to Bangkok or Singapore where you have a second (useless) security check then a waiting area to sit until your flight is ready to board but the waiting area itself doesn't open until about an hour before boarding. If you're too early there's really no place to sit in the main terminal unless you have lounge access or patronize one of the overpriced restaurants.,3,0
delhi-airport,Andy Tse,Canada,Terminal 3 departure area to fairly quiet. Immigration was very smooth at least a dozen counters open for tourists and I was through in about 10 minutes. The rest of the terminal was in excellent condition and at least half the shops were completed and open for business. Easy to get around from the gates and overall a huge upgrade over the old terminal.,5,0
delhi-airport,John Broome,Philippines,I used the new terminal a week or so after the opening. The landside / check-in area is large with room to move but if you are early for check-in then plan to sit on your suitcase. Anywhere remotely looking like seating was filled to capacity with locals sleeping. Once check-in opened then the lines quickly formed although in fairness I have been in slower lines. Landside shops? forget it! Lines of people waiting at passport control has transferred from the old terminal to the new one same people of course! It takes these guys ages to do anything. At one point the line next to mine (and they had been waiting a long time) were told to go to another line because the officer was due his tea break! Security checks are far too slow but faster than the old terminal maybe they are nervous but I think needing to remove a shaver electric lead from hand baggage and sending it through the scanner again is a bit too much! Airside immediate impression is 'wow India have entered the airport excellence challenge' after a while you remember where you are and can easily see where you are. Shops are there but overpriced (cheaper to buy your last minute present in Delhi) no available seats near anything like a coffee shop and the area around the main one was dirty. Further in towards departure gates the areas are very large pleasant and fully carpeted. I wonder if that was good idea since it looked dirty already and with kids spilling their coke (seen many times in the 2 hour airside wait) it wont last long! To give this airport any glowing report now would distract from what it will be like - if I said the waiting areas at the gates and the open areas at landside are the best things at the airport then its a good guide.,2,0
delhi-airport,P Baxter,Australia,Just spent 7 hours waiting in transit lounge at Delhi Airport whilst travelling London to Delhi with Air India and Delhi to KL with Air Asia in circumstances where my wife and I could have and should have spent no longer than 5 minutes in the area. The rule operating in practice is that you cannot transit until the airline which delivered you to Delhi signs you over and you are accepted by the airline taking you out again. This is so even where you are appropriately ticketed and have an internet boarding pass for the ongoing flight. So if there is no one available at your ongoing airline or no one processes your request from the arriving airline you simply sit and wait and are effectively left in limbo. The only way to get through is to constantly harass the staff to keep checking on where matters are for your particular case. You are invariably told each time you approach the desk by the person on the counter that they do not work for the particular airline that you are flying out on and the matter is not their responsibility. Air India appears to be the only company represented in the transit area. Many people are forced to spend long periods (in some cases more than 24 hours) confined in the transit room with no shops or other facilities. This is completely unnecessary where passengers hold ongoing ticketing. No one appears to be in charge or available to deal with passenger transit. You are just locked in a room and left to fend for yourself. I saw many very frustrated and distressed people unable to have their individual transit situations appropriately dealt with. The many individual staff members at the transit desk whilst personally pleasant were incompetent to handle the situation. The whole shambolic situation is a debacle. I was told by another passenger that on one occasion the security staff would not even allow travellers out of the room to go to the toilet for a period in excess of 3 hours.,1,0
delhi-airport,T Mozumder,Finland,The new terminal 3 at Delhi Airport is well laid out clean and seems to be up to international standards. Signage is very clear. Immigration and emigration process times are fast. Luggage delivered pretty fast. Toilets clean. Shopping is satisfactory though merchandise variety especially quality Indian products within a reasonable price range could be better. The retail space available in the international section is definitely not some 20K m2 as advertised by DIAL. Not even close. Landside is not yet fully ready.,5,0
delhi-airport,Jack Splowski,United States,International terminal 3 is finally a goer. It is an improvement on the previous effort T2 (that would not be difficult). It is new - Indian new (meaning not entirely finished). Where it is finished on close inspection it actually isn't. Departure is an improvement (but not much) as is Arrival (still have the really self important immigration officers but that is true everywhere). Everything is quicker slightly quicker which is better than it was. Luggage still takes a long time to arrive which is mysterious. Departure lounge is amazingly expensive - $6 for a small beer kind of expensive. They have a sports bar which as of now is not actually licensed but they do have a smoking room as a nod to Asian tolerance. Do not look too closely at the fine workmanship as that will only disappoint and whatever you do do not chuckle as chuckling tends to offend too. In all a very Indian effort but still better than the previous effort that was T2. The domestic terminal is actually an efficient (and dare I say it) pleasant experience and quite a surprise. Naturally that will be closing and relocating to terminal T2 in the very near future.,3,0
delhi-airport,A Maxton,Japan,Used the new T3 for an international departure shortly after it opened in July end. While the outlook of the terminal is greatly improved I still had to wait in a long queue outside to get in. They have at least 8 entrances to the terminal but only 2 were open to passengers after checking of tickets and passport. Why not open a few more to ease the flow of passengers getting in!! Once inside another long queue at the check-in counter of Jet Airways who seemed to be checking in all domestic and international passengers at same counters. Security check didn't take very long and I was just in time at the gate to board my flight. The washroom near the gate had no lights. Apparently was still in a state of construction. However being a new terminal it was clean. Advice: Give yourself enough time before departure to have a less stressful departure experience.,3,0
delhi-airport,O Schmidt,Germany,I used this airport four times in the past quarter of a year. The international terminal is dirty badly managed simply unsuitable to bear the amount of passengers. Adversely the domestic terminal is modern full of light clean and well organized.,3,0
delhi-airport,Ajay Puri,Singapore,Delhi's new Terminal 3 has finally opened. Lots of aerobridges travelators well laid out baggage hall clean toilets - a truly superior experience compared to the old terminal. I wish they could improve the calibre of people at Immigration and it isn't fully ready (lounges and outlets are still being put into place) but it is an international quality terminal. I noticed that there is now a proper transit area for connecting passengers.,4,0
delhi-airport,J Albrecht,United Kingdom,Quite similar experience as any one - food stalls are empty display vague westernized food. Nowhere to go. But still the unmissable Indian experience.,3,0
delhi-airport,A Sijapati,United States,Delhi Airport (International Terminal) was not as good as I thought it would be. I had to spend seven hours in transit area of the international terminal while going/coming back to/from Kathmandu. The international transit wait area has just hard bottom seats restrooms two little light snack stalls and two TVs - no duty free or lounges restaurants/cafes cyber stations sofas etc - all of these are available beyond security on the way to boarding flights which happens only 3 hours prior to the departure time. The transit wait area is a small area and authorities/airline land crew not very helpful - saw some airline crew make fun of a non-English speaking passenger which looks like is a frequent case here sadly. They just opened up a new terminal last week may be the conditions there has improved!,3,0
delhi-airport,J Shaka,United Kingdom,If you are a transit passenger who is going to have to wait for extended periods of time in the transit lounge do not do it. We flew to Bangkok stopping 15 hours in transit. We knew it would be a long wait but did not understand the ordeal we would face. The facilities are absolutely appalling and the staff do not want to know that you are freezing because the air- con is sub zero temperature all night. You are not allowed to use the clipper lounge unless you are business class. No cash machine no currency exchange. Filthy toilets. No information desk unless you have already passed through security check! After 15 hours of begging for help from airport staff customs office and airline staff we were near breaking point. Staff laughing at us. There are other issues for western women which I cannot speak of during this review but you are going to find it most uncomfortable. If you can avoid New Delhi in transit ove night please do. I do not wish our experience on anyone.,1,0
delhi-airport,S Dimms,United Kingdom,This must rank as one of worst capital city airports anywhere. Staff rude security whilst visible is largely ineffective the place is filthy! My advice is touch nothing - get on the plane ASAP and use the facilities on board.,1,0
denpasar-bali-airport,John Moore,Australia,"The new airport at Bali is a credit to the designer and the people who run it, sure there are some minor delays but if you have to wait there are plenty of places where you can get a good meal for around $6 to $8 AUD. We got there at 5.30 am and even then there was restaurants open, if you compare it to the disgrace that is Perth Airport, where the only food is wet sandwiches or microwaved Pizza at certain times then Denpasar airport is ten star, it also leaves the new airport at Kuala Lumpur in it's shadow, once you are through the gates at KL theres a 20 minute fast walk to the planes with only a muffin stand for food, so if you are delayed as we were, we had two hours with only a muffin and water.",9,1
denpasar-bali-airport,Michael Beer,Austria,"It is a new airport. But when you have passed the immigration, it is an endless walk till you come to the gates. Why? Because you have to pass numerous shops. There is no direct way. Shame on such kind of passenger ""forcing"" to walk by! ",1,0
denpasar-bali-airport,P Tracy,United States,"Surprisingly nice, new airport (domestic terminal) with ample shopping, coffee bars and restaurants. Nice open, modern feel.",8,1
denpasar-bali-airport,N Ramsay,Australia,"Arrived mid evening, visa on arrival purchase, immigration and baggage claim was very quick - although the crowd was building up behind us. Customs was a little slower but in the end was just a cursory inspection aided by X-ray. Walking thru a 'shopping mall' to arrivals landslide is a pain. The car park station was chaotic but that is Bali. International Departure was easy. Very pleasant waiting area with lots of food/ drink options. Of course it is another shopping mall. Gate lounge was comfortable enough and Singapore Airlines has the boarding by group well organised. One of the many good SE Asian airports.",8,1
denpasar-bali-airport,William Lay,Singapore,"Bit crowded in Arrivals. I was in the baggage hall within about 30 mins of landing in the afternoon which is very bad. No wait on baggage but had the usual confusion about which carousel it's on. The monitors showed the planes that had arrived but did not show the carousel numbers where to collect your baggage. After 45 minutes we finally found our bags. On my next flight departure, it's nicer than the arrival in terms of experience. The check in was smooth and not much problem. But, I think the airport need to improve on the boarding system as to make the queue shorter and make people more convenient. Overall, it's a nice airport experience.",7,1
denpasar-bali-airport,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,Bit crowded in Arrivals but I was in the baggage hall within about 20 mins of landing in late afternoon which is not too bad. I believe the $35 Visa Fee is about to be dropped. (The Departure Tax has already been dropped). No wait on baggage but had the usual confusion about which carousel it's on. No big deal I was pointed in the right direction and was out of the terminal a few minutes later. Taxi system is fine with no waiting involved. Departures were quick and slick with no queuing at all on Air Asia. The Duty Free Shopping area is extensive for a small airport but didn't appear especially good value. Signage isn't great so you have to check carefully to avoid gate screw ups. A better airport than I was expecting.,7,1
denpasar-bali-airport,G Kemp,Australia,"First visit to Bali for my Wife and I and first impressions of the airport left me fuming. For the millions and millions of dollars the Government makes through the arrival tax (USD $35) and departure tax ($200K Rupiah) surely they can get their systems right. Firstly the queue's on arrival to get your passport stamped and to pay the arrival tax were staggering. They did have almost all the booths open yet it took at least 35 minutes to get through. Then the fun starts - the monitors showed the planes that had arrived but did not show the carousel numbers where to collect your baggage. There were 4 carousels with hundreds of bags on them and people (including us) were going from carousel to carousel trying to locate their own baggage. Don't bother to ask a Airport employee as they have no idea or just don't answer your question. After 45 minutes (yes 45 minutes) we found our bags. Very frustrating. Yet more frustration on our flight home - we checked in and went through the various 4 or 5 steps even before you get through: check in - go to another counter to pay your departure tax - go to another counter to have the departure tax receipted - go to the next counter to have your passport stamped and then at least your through. But wait there's more - our flight we were advised would leave from gate 11 and we proceeded to gate 11 (which is downstairs). When we got to the stairs to go down 2 guards at tables were checking bags etc. for water bottles. When he asked what flight and where we were going we weren't allowed through as ""you have to wait for the current flight to leave before you can go to the gate"". I'm not sure why but there was no way we were getting through. Once they packed up and left (20 minutes) we then went downstairs to the gate and waited for our flight. But it doesn't end there! There was a monitor above the departure gate but no details - then 30 minutes before our flight was due to leave 2 employees rolled up and placed the various flags and placards of their airline next to the gate - and these were of a different airline to ours. Upon enquiry as to our flight they had no idea (which was understandable as they are a different airline). Result - upstairs again and in a hurry to find which gate we were supposed to be at. We ended up locating where we had to be (gate 9) but there was no announcement; no details on any of the monitors to inform us that the gate had changed. Overall a shambles to be honest which leaves me thinking twice about returning.",2,0
denpasar-bali-airport,O Dominic,Australia,"I've found a quiet time - 2pm on a Friday. Immigration was quick however on the second visit luggage took 45 minutes. Taxis are more organised but despite increasing the listed fares they still don't honour them (the board now says R70k to ""Kuta 2"" but they want R100k and even my Indonesian colleague couldn't get below R95k). And there's still a long walk from the booking booth (just before the gauntlet of shops at the exit - note that the only convenient ATM is opposite the booth) to where the taxis actually are.",5,0
denpasar-bali-airport,S Osborne,Thailand,Had a connecting flight in just two hours after landing and was a bit worried about the long immigration lines after reading some reviews here. All in all the whole experience with many queues i.e. visa on arrival - immigration - collecting luggage - check-in to the next flight - departure tax - immigration again took less than one hour. Most of the queues were short and fast. The only disappointment was that just transiting through the place cost me 56 USD - 35 USD for visa on arrival and 21 USD for departure tax (it is actually 200000 Rp but they use some crazy exchange rate if you want to pay in USD).,8,1
denpasar-bali-airport,Ian Humphreys,Australia,The airport is slowly growing with many more shops and gate lounges now in operation. The lounges need departure and arrival screens and PA systems. The departure gates are still constantly changing which needs to be rectified. The arrival situation is a disaster with a two hour period just standing waiting to get through immigration. We spent fifteen minutes total time in Melbourne airport upon our return. Denpasar is a disgrace as far as this goes. Departure from there is not that much better.,2,0
denpasar-bali-airport,R Coach,Australia,I went through this airport twice in the last two weeks both times I landed between 17.30 and 18.30 and left between 7.00 am and 11.00am. There was no waiting at visa on arrival or immigration and it took less then 10 mins to get to the baggage hall. The departure hall is a big improvement over the old terminals. All in all a good experience.,8,1
denpasar-bali-airport,P Barfield,Australia,For a brand new airport terminal I was staggered to find out there are absolutely no drinking water fountains and the water in the toilets is not potable. So when you empty your water bottles at the security check point there is no way to refill your bottles before boarding your flight. This is a very handy scam for the shop owners who make a lot of money by selling bottled water. Why they built a new airport terminal without one drinking water fountain beggars belief. Unfortunately like all airports they are monopoly businesses set up to extract as much money as possible from people that must be rich enough to travel therefore no sympathy for them.,,0
denpasar-bali-airport,R Entwistle,United Kingdom,Fantastic modern Airport. On arrival progressed swiftly through immigration visa control and baggage checks my baggage already on carousel from landing to sitting in a Taxi it was just 30 minutes. Very friendly officials. Departure baggage and boarding very efficient you enter through very well sited duty free shops before entering the main lounge. Plenty of good hospitality available especially Last wave where you can get your last Bintang. The quality of the food is excellent and although slightly higher priced its well worth the money. Everything is easily accessible plenty of seating areas. Departure was on time and very smoothly run.,10,1
denpasar-bali-airport,Jo Mitchell,Australia,Arrival into Bali was a shocker. Day time arrival no air conditoning massive line up times. Paid entry fee in Australian dollars received change in rupiah and the receipt had to be requested and was given to us in US dollars. Whilst being held up in queues our bags were going round and round the carousal for hours. On the way to wait for the car many locals physically tried to take our bags from us and get us to use their transport. Our transport officer did not assist us with this. Departing - Officials taking peoples bags from them and making the traveller wait in line for check in whilst they take bags out of sight to check for drugs. From there to pay departure tax to customs to multiple gate stuff ups including not even labelling gates to a carryon bag search and pat down before being allowed in the gate. Once in the gate you couldn't leave and there was no water or food available for sale. Entry to the gate saw all water confiscated. Not enough seating at the gate with most travellers sitting or lying on the floor. When boarding the tarmac shuttle bus Virgin officials collected our passenger departure cards once shuttled to the tarmac there were no escorts at all or paths to the rear entry point of the plane so passengers were free to wonder around the tarmac.,2,0
denpasar-bali-airport,J Soetandi,Australia,I was at the new Denpasar airport last year and was impressed with how it looks. Great modern design but that's where it stops. They disregard the general common sense to make the airport experience good. Here's a few that I want to point out: 1) No baby room - at least a nappy table in a toilet would be sufficient. In this modern day and age I can't comprehend why they did not put this in while building the airport. So in a desperate attempt we had to look for quiet corner in the waiting lounge. 2) Travelator at the entrance is a hazard risk. A lot of people are just lazy in walking. So they stacked up their heavy baggage on a trolley and use it on the Travelator. What happened then is the trolley couldn't not exit the travelator due to its weight and it topples over. The travelator did not stop. They obviously did not think this through. 3) Air Conditioning fail. Upon entering the temperature is soaring especially in the afternoon where the sun blazes in through the side. Very uncomfortable. The AC wasn't able to handle this so we waited for many hours in the heat inside the airport. I had a very uncomfortable experience in this supposedly new airport. I am visiting the airport again next month and I hope they have addressed the issues. The only good thing about the airport are the cleaners.,,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Tony Hall,Australia,Denpasar Airport. Compared to the situation when I passed through in July 2014 the new Denpasar Airport International terminal appeared to be at last nearly complete and functioning. The air bridges were now working. The business lounge was now open with computers wine and toilets available. It is small but very pleasant in design. The only drawback was they the played Balinese music quite loudly over the PA system which is not going to be to everyone's taste.,7,1
denpasar-bali-airport,J Stephen,Australia,This airport is the worst I have ever been too. On arrival it is common for immigration waits of 2-3 hours. These queues are deliberate so that you pay the 'express fee' i.e. a bribe to avoid the queue. This airport is a disgrace. It has just been built but already there are not enough seats for outgoing passengers. The baggage claim can take forever because they are not big enough to take the bags from one whole flight.,,0
denpasar-bali-airport,B Schmidt,United States,Got off the plane at 12.20 pm and was met at the gate by a hotel representative and proceeded to go through VOA passport baggage claim customs luggage x-ray and then duty free and to are waiting vehicle in 29 minutes - amazing. On Departure left my hotel at 1.30 pm for a 4.05 pm flight. Got to the airport went through check in Departure tax security check and passport control and got to my gate in 25 minutes. This airport was by far easier than going / coming from LAX.,10,1
denpasar-bali-airport,TN Ramaswamy,India,This was our first trip to Bali. Having read some awful reviews before our departure we went with a great deal of apprehension and limited expectations. I must say however that our experience - both arrival and departure - was excellent. When we arrived the total time taken from VOA through immigration baggage collection and customs to the waiting hotel car was just about 15-20 minutes. On our departure we left the hotel early (anticipating long queues and delays) to arrive at the airport some 3 hours before our scheduled departure. The time taken from the time we got out of the car until we reached the departure gates (baggage screening check-in airport tax immigration and security) took us all of 20 minutes or so. Throughout the process we encountered friendly and efficient staff. We thus had a lot of time to spend at the airport and we found the shops restaurants and facilities to be very good. On the whole we had an excellent experience.,10,1
denpasar-bali-airport,Justinus Sutedjo,Australia,We are on the way back From Jakarta to Sydney via Denpasar nearly got lost in the airport. No clear sign and no ground crew directing transit/connecting flight passenger from domestic to international airport. We have to find our way from domestic airport to international airport with very confusing direction/sign lucky we met with a group of touring driver on break which direct us to the more easy route instead of following the sign!,5,1
denpasar-bali-airport,L Flood,New Zealand,Just returned from our Bali family holiday. After having a good holiday our departure experience was beyond ridiculous. After boarding the shuttle bus to travel to our plane the bus stopped turned off the aircon leaving us waiting to get off. I guess that the flight staff were not ready. Eventually aircon turned back on only then for the driver to disembark us onto the tarmac to board our flight. Light rain was falling but okay given the temperature. What was not okay was a bus departing and the light rain turning to pouring down on us. We boarded our Virgin Australia flight soaked dripping wet and sitting in aircon for a five hour flight. We were offered paper towels to dry off. Nobody should have to board a flight in that condition.,4,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Gael Martin,France,I live in Bali part of the year and have to deal with this awful airport far too often. First the parking is small badly design the ramp access to upper floors is far too narrow making it too narrow to turn properly with a car. Inside the airport things are not much better. On departure Bali airport's has the most expensive taxes in all of Indonesia. Do you get a better service for that price? No. Arrival is a nightmare waiting times can be extremely long. After you eventually get out of the airport be prepared to face people who will follow and harass you to offer taxi services. If you want a taxi go to the official taxi counter there is an official price list with all major destinations on the island. Once you leave the airport you have to pay for the parking every time because DPS does not have a drop off area. If you want to drop off a friend with your car you have to take a ticket and to pay a one-hour parking fee. If you come with a motorbike be prepared to walk because the narrow and crowded motorbikes parking is located outside from the airport about 15mn walk from the terminals - very nice during the rainy season.,1,0
denpasar-bali-airport,L Obrien,Australia,Our flight was scheduled for 3pm so we left to arrive at the airport at 12pm as many different sites mention long delays leaving. This obviously depends on the day I'm not sure but from arrival at the airport to stepping into the temporary lounge it was 21 minutes including the checking in 6 pieces of luggage through priority check-in. The airport is air conditioned - still crazy but better than the old one. The temporary lounge was mediocre but the drinks were cold the seats comfy and there was constant turning over of food but choice is limited. If you want other stuff wait for your flight or just head to any of the shops offering food. My biggest advice - check your gate. Ours changed without warning.,7,1
denpasar-bali-airport,M Embry,Australia,Just visited Bali after vowing never to return 3 years ago. Had read all the reviews about the new airport so was very anxious. We arrived at quarter to midnight on AFL grand final Friday night. We had purchased visas from very friendly staff were there were ample staff. Hopped into the lines for immigration and went oh no as the lines were massive. We were out the front of the airport meeting our friends half an hour later after finding lots of immigration desks open and very friendly staff. Our return was even more pleasant straight through check in and immigration. Plenty of wonderful places to Buy food shop sit etc. we certainly found that it was not an unpleasant airport experience by a long shot. Well done Bali on your upgrade.,8,1
denpasar-bali-airport,M Bloniarz,United Kingdom,Poor service dirty windows floors horrible toilets. That airport is the worst in that part of the world. And one of the most expensive. Sadly it's impossible to avoid this place. Not the best gateway to beautiful Bali. We waited 3 hours in the Q for a passport control after arrived. They should try put customers on the first place.,1,0
denpasar-bali-airport,A Lorkin,Australia,Flew into Denpasar early afternoon on Virgin from Brisbane. Almost no queues to pay for VOA but was confronted with a very lengthy snaking queue for immigration. We had 2 small children in a party of 5. At first the line was moving and it appeared we would clear immigration in approx 1.5 hours but that was before the immigration booth numbers were reduced to half. Don't know why but the immigration officers just walked off with even more flights having arrived after ours. About 30 minutes later extra immigration staff arrived and opened up some more booths. We cleared immigration in 2.15 hours and then collected our luggage which had been loaded off the carousel. Very tiring and stressful - not a great welcome to Bali. I had heard all the horror stories which sadly became true on this occasion. Our subsequent 4pm departure was an absolute breeze. Am returning in Jan 2015 so hopefully will have a better arrival experience.,3,0
denpasar-bali-airport,R Brown,United States,Arrived midday on Thai from Bangkok and the airport was in utter chaos. The lines to immigration snaked around forever. Airport agents were offering to take people to the front of the line for 'only' $10! Otherwise we waited and waited while immigration officials came and went and waited and waited. It took 1.5 hours to get through immigration. A nightmare welcome to this otherwise dreamy island. Leaving the country was much more organized and much faster.,,0
denpasar-bali-airport,A McDermott,Australia,"Arrived on a Virgin flight Friday 5th September 2014 at around 3pm. Took 3 hours to get through the visa/customs debacle. Left on Monday 15th September 2014 and took 40 mins to check in go through all of the checks and find our departure gate which did change 3 times while we waited but thanks to these reviews we were prepared and just sat it out and listened to the announcements. Take plenty of rupiahs to the airport - food and coffee is very expensive. I bought two sandwiches and two mango smoothies and then did not have the $30.00! I don't know what the solution is to avoiding the busy periods on arrival - maybe travel agents have a heads up on ""good"" times to arrive and avoid the longest queue I have ever seen or been in in my life. Oh and my husband went off to see if he could ""pay"" for a faster entry and was told yes - $100 each to jump the queue which we declined more for fear of crowd rebellion than the exorbitant price.",1,0
denpasar-bali-airport,R Mahalm,New Zealand,"Read some of the other reports on the new airport in Bali and some of the reports are ridiculously inaccurate. We arrived 3.5 hours early and ready for battle only to find great signage impossible to get lost loads of food options at about 3-4 large cafe/restaurant/bars with ample seating sure they are at typical airport prices but comparable to any international airport in Aus/South Pacific pleasant temperature typically polite and friendly service staff. Yes they work at Balinese speed but don't forget you're on holiday! So get over it! So in terms of what to expect at the main entry there aren't really good food options other than snacks at a WH Smith you will go through one security screen (no queue for us) then check in. Pay your departure tax at 2 easily identified booths before customs/passport control. One more security screen (where now you do have to ditch your water) with your carry on and you're then into the main plaza where there are loads of shops (which are at eye watering prices after the kuta market!) and plenty of eating options. We are about to head to our gate now which is a 2 min walk) sure we may see another security screen but they're hardly an issue. Yes the arrival is a bit more tedious with massive room but only a handful of passport control people but with 3 flights arriving at once we still only had about an hour and we were through. Be mindful of the uniformed ""porters"" who will grab your bags in the baggage claim area unless you're ready to tip them and then we'd recommend head straight to the taxi booth where it took us about 5 mins to sort a cab at what is a reasonable price (or go and haggle with one of the multitude of freelance drivers who will try it on with the 1st 2nd and 3rd prices they offer you). Really can't see what the fuss is about.",9,1
denpasar-bali-airport,Peter Chan,Netherlands,Arrived at 3pm on 03-09 from Amsterdam via Hong Kong together with other flights from Australia. Queuing for a visa was quick but rather long for immigration- over an hour. The question is do we want all airports to be like Singapore-Changi? I definitely do not as this is what all travelling is about experiencing different cultures and circumstances. If you find this unacceptable than staying at home is an option as the queues are not going to move any faster.,6,1
denpasar-bali-airport,L Carter,Australia,After reading all the reviews I was expecting the absolute worse. Landed on a Saturday evening and overall took Due for a 2.45 arrival on a Thursday landing delayed as we had to sit in a holding pattern for over 30 mins. 1.5hr wait to get through immigration word is that you can't purchase the VIP pass anymore to get through quicker but you can go up to someone and pay then and there if they are in a good mood. I was already 4 lines into my wait when I found this out so didn't want to risk it. Flying business or having premium FF gets you nothing on arrival at this airport every foreigner queues together. On top of all of that took an hour to get to Seminyak. Departure was a completely different story. 20 min drive from same Seminyak location at 6pm on a Monday. Waited 5 mins at priority check in (here I was provided an entry card to the temporary lounge) around the same to pay the departure tax (yes it's annoying but most if not all other imports have this it's just built into the taxes when you book your flights!) then maybe 15 mins at immigration? In there there's also 2 security check points that had less than a 3 min wait. Decent sized duty free but pricey from what I saw (alcohol in Australian airports is cheaper). The temp lounge was packed could probably fit 100 or so people seated. Food selection consisted of sandwiches vegetables soups fried rice salads and some fruit. Refreshments include sodas water beer and wine as well as hot drinks. Severe lack of power points which seems to be a growing trend these days. I walked past 3 food outlets to get to the lounge but can't comment on the quality or selection. If is written this review based purely on arrival you'd see 1 star but I'll bump it up a bit because of my departure experience.,5,0
denpasar-bali-airport,B Rudd,Singapore,Just over the whole place I visit Bali at least 7 to 8 times a year and sometimes only for three days but having to spend so much wasted time at a dysfunctional airport both in and out that seems to be getting worse even through it cost more to enter and exit. Why is the departure tax cost not included in the ticket like most other airports? Then its up to the airline to hand over the fees instead of passengers waiting in yet another unnecessary line. Its amazing that this airport was officially opened in August 2013 yet its still under construction and still has no proper air line loungers only a poorly fitted out premier lounge with stale food and uncleaned seats with staff who mainly just stand around rather than looking after the lounge. So its seems that if you just clap your hands and smile all the problems will go way or at least this is how the airport management deal with things.,2,0
denpasar-bali-airport,S Tomlinson,United Kingdom,New airport is much worse than the old one. Much of it still seems unfinished with a confused and confusing layout. Few staff are apparent and the immigration staff are the rudest I have met. An officer with little grasp of English grilled my wife at the desk about wanting to work in Bali for no apparent reason at all. If this is the introduction to Bali it will put people off visiting. The exit is via duty free and on leaving you enter via duty free just to try to squeeze the last rupiah from your fingers. On departure the food is over priced garbage. All this and the increase to $35 in the arrival tax and 200000 rp departure tax - obviously not spent on the airport.,,0
denpasar-bali-airport,A Sutherland,Australia,After reading all the reviews I was expecting the absolute worse. Landed on a Saturday evening and overall took about an hour from landing till getting out of the airport. VOA arrival took about 15 minutes and was easier than I remember. Now the immigration lines themselves were long and slow. With staff talking amongst themselves. That was the bottleneck. The advantage was my bag came out about 2 minutes after getting through immigration and through the x-rays 5 minutes later. Leaving was a different story (shocked at how quick it was). Arrived early took 10 minutes to check in the Departure tax line was 5 minutes and through the security checks and immigration 10 minutes after that. It's like 2 different airports. Inbound dirty and feels grimy. Departures was clean! Needs more seating though. Warning: Australia bound Flights go through a final security check at the gate (looking for liquids). This is not their fault this is an Australian Government Request and ran into this at every airport in the last 12 months (including Dubai).,6,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Leo Brown,Australia,Terrible huge queues on arrival it took us two hours to get through the airport almost as long as it took to fly here from WA! New airport is slower than the old one and the increase in airport tax must be lining someone's pocket because it's not put towards staff at the arrivals desk! 4 people trying to check in thousands and they didn't seem to be any hurry. Terrible start to a holiday.,,0
denpasar-bali-airport,K van Dijk,Australia,We have travelled to Bali 4 times now as we love everything about this paradise - the culture the people the land and the lifestyle. However our recent trip was the first one through the new terminal. First impression was wow - this is huge and easy to navigate. Payment of the arrival visa of $35 US was quick and easy. Then we noticed the 'cattle grids' to get through immigration and the queue to get into the cattle grids this took us just under 2 hours. By the time we got to the luggage carousel many flights had landed after ours so our luggage was piled in a heap against the wall. Moving on another very lengthy queue of disillusioned passengers was waiting for us to scan everything on the way out. Fortunately our driver was patient enough to wait - 2.5 hours from plane to exit is beyond ridiculous. The way out was worse - Our flight departed at 12.20am. Our driver dropped us at the airport around 9.30pm we expected to check in find our gate and perhaps sit and read for an hour. Lengthy queues again - lost count of the security checks and how many times we had our luggage scrutinized paid the 200000 IRP exit visa negotiated our way through passport control to be affronted with what can only be described as a duty free shopping mall with the gates hidden behind more attempts to part you with what money you have left only to find our departure gate but no seating. After standing around for a while checked the departure screens to find that our flight had been moved to another gate at the opposite end of the (enormous) terminal. Arrived at the rescheduled gate to at least see a very welcome seating area queued up (again) to have our hand luggage checked (again) to find out that the departure gate was changed back to the original gate we were at with no seating! Apparently this gate is only a standing waiting area where you are crammed in like sardines to wait for your standing room only bus to take you out onto the tarmac to climb the steps to your plane. Ours was not the only flight leaving from this gate - 5 others were at the same time well when I say gate it was more like a bus terminal - without seating! So if you find that your flight is departing through gate 10 - prepare for a long wait on your feet! Needless to say we spent the 3 hours departing this terminal waiting in queues and walking from gate to gate when we were anticipating a lengthy relaxing read! Needless to say - we had a wonderful trip to only be tarnished by this airport - Initial thoughts from the front it looks absolutely amazing sky high vaulted ceilings beautifully decorated and planted but it just does not work.. With the exchange rate my partner and I spent almost $120.00 Au on getting in and out to experience what can only be described as a very poor one.,,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Patrick Briggs,Australia,I agree that the new airport is worse than the old. Are the carpets really new or temporary. They are so so dirty. There are no facilities and the lounges are a disgrace. I cannot believe how bad it is. With all the money available for this project the situation beggars belief.,,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Marvin Sing,Singapore,Terrible airport. Bali achieved quite a performance there. They have built a new airport which is even worse than the old one. Average waiting time to clear immigration and customs is between 1 to 1.5hr some unlucky passengers may even have to wait 2hrs. A complete disaster and a total shame.,,0
denpasar-bali-airport,D Kolen,Australia,Arrival was a disgraceful 2 hours to get through now having to pay $35 US for an entry visa per person and the queue for immigration was horrendous. Very bad start to holiday. Well to depart was 10 times worse new airport but where are the staff the scanning machines and down right customer service. You now pay 200000 rupiah for departure tax. The worst experience ever in Bali after 25 years of travel to Bali. People were missing their flights even though they arrived 3 hours before. The system here is shocking and we have now decided to never return to Bali. We pay a very high price to enter and leave this country so one would expect good efficient service. So chaotic be very prepared.,2,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Philippe Dupont,Luxembourg,Bali is a wonderful island. Unfortunately the airport the gateway to the island is a disaster. Many of those that land in Bali have spent long hours in a plane and truly look forward to relax on this beautiful island. It can't be that you then have to queue for more than 1.5 hours first to pay for a so-called visa then to pass customs and then to remit a form in which you declare not having imported certain goods. This airport is a threat to Bali's economy and it is hard to understand why after so many bad reviews nothing seems to happen. We will not come back until this issue is solved.,,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Dave Ho,Australia,A perfect introduction to all of the worst aspects of Bali. The new Bali airport is a shocker let's give credit where credit is due. It's clean has clean toilets and it's big and new that's it that's all that it currently has going for it. The worst things about the old Bali airport have moved across very comfortably to the new airport. Rude and arrogant immigration and customs officials. Deliberately lengthy immigration queues which always then have the option of paying extra to get through quickly. Ridiculously restrictive alcohol rules again so you can pay your way a round them. Endless hassling by porters. Then you end up in a beaten up taxi with a rude taxi driver charging you too much and taking too long. Basically an over priced rip off and a really ugly first impression of Indonesia and more sadly Bali. Whenever possible fly in through Jakarta.,,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Tapani Utunen,Finland,Was looking forward to the new airport so much after a number of visits to the old terminal. What a disgrace: arrived 3pm on a Tuesday in July queued 2-3 hours for visa fee booth and passport control was exhausted after this not-so-happy start for a holiday. Poorly designed and poorly manned. Departure was slightly better but long queues again. The architects should have read Bali Times or Jakarta Post more carefully over the years both have duly reported the rapidly increasing number of flights to this great island. What a shame they got the new airport so wrong!,1,0
denpasar-bali-airport,T Ekberg,Sweden,"100 countries visited and this is by far the worst airport if you take in what means they have available. Bali has a working tourist infrastructure people are friendly and they are able to build proper houses. Yet its airport experience shames the whole island when it comes to first and last impression. Arriving is hell. Departing is hell. On arrival there are queues to join the first queue. To pay for your arrival ""visa"". Its not a visa its just a fee. Then its the queue to the non-existent passport ""control"". But with thousands of people queuing for just a few open windows who can blame them for not checking anything but that you paid for your ""visa"". Even if you spent two hours queuing your luggage will not have arrived yet at the luggage hall. On leaving there will be more fees to pay and at least 7-8 checks before you are on the plane. Same things checked over and over again as if the other checks where manned by incompetent idiots. This Airport is best avoided. It you are coming from Asia/Europe it might be quicker to transfer to a domestic flight in Jakarta. At least you wont start and finish your vacation with resentment towards Bali.",,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Tony Hall,Australia,The airport is still undergoing reconstruction. None of the air bridges were working in either old or new terminals. Domestic departures was through the old domestic arrivals area. Business lounges for both domestic and international flights were fenced off parts of the main concourses with no computers available. No alcohol was on display but I discovered that in the international lounge a waitress would bring you a glass of wine if you asked for one. Arriving from Australia was a dreadful experience because many flights arrive at the same time. There is no fast track. Travellers should note that you have to pay the visa charge a desk before immigration which is not immediately obvious. It took 35 mins just to get through passport control with further long queues for the customs scanner and to exit the car park. (I subsequently noticed that there was not a car park wait at other times of the day.),4,0
denpasar-bali-airport,A Bracher,Australia,Arrived early afternoon with carry-on luggage. Through new Bali airport in twenty minutes! Helpful pleasant staff. Returned to Australia on 9pm flight Friday and experienced similar scenario!,8,1
denpasar-bali-airport,Janey George,New Zealand,Very poor communication here. Staff were friendly but incredibly slow we almost missed a departing flight in spite of being there early. The departure gate had been changed but no announcement was made the incorrect gate was on the boarding pass and electronic screens. A final call was made for our flight a few minutes before departure resulting in a huge cue of confused passengers required to use the same gate as another flight to another city at the same time. Sealed water bottles sold to us were confiscated yet other passengers were able to take theirs through as most bags but not all were searched. Food and beverages were very expensive and service slow. I have been to airports all over the world and although modern and clean this one was very disorganised. Our arrival was just as frustrating with 2-3 hr queues through customs luggage dumped on the floor and poor communication to passengers.,4,0
denpasar-bali-airport,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,Very different experiences arriving and departing. Arriving we encountered massive and slow moving immigration queues and the most unfriendly staff i can remember at any airport. Leaving the terminal you see how much of an effort they have made to make it look nice with thousands of plants cascading down the outside walls of the terminal which itself is quite contemporary and airy. On leaving Bali the experience was better with very friendly staff all the way through and pretty good facilities for an airport of its size.,7,1
denpasar-bali-airport,M DeRoche,Australia,I just wanted to give my review after leaving Denpasar this morning at 8.30. I was very nervous especially having read these reviews. Our arrival 3.5 weeks earlier was pretty much what everyone else has described. Sure there's lots of room for improvement. But it's always been that way. So this review and taking is really just in relation to our departure experience. This morning we had an 8.30 am flight. We were checked in paid our departure tax gone through immigration and were sitting down to a rather pricey coffee by about 6.45. So all very smooth sailing. The airport is clean no toilet queues all very nice. I realise this would be different at different times of the day. So we're sitting killing an hour and a half before we leave and at 8.10 we decide we should head to the departure gate. But on the way we hear them page my husband. We arrive at the gate and we're late! We're last on the plane. There was no announcement but this was probably our fault for not getting to the gate earlier. Anyway I just thought I'd give my POV as I know a lot of people (me included) rely on info from the www and we can get too caught up in all the bad stuff. But our experience this morning was a breeze.,10,1
denpasar-bali-airport,Nicholas Tan,Singapore,When we arrived at the airport still part of the building was under construction lots of declaration forms first second declare prohibited items then long queue at the scanning point. I wish the white card and declaration of the prohibited items was together to make things easier. When returning to Singapore drinks were expensive limited chairs and make sure you have at least 200000 rupiah per person when returning for airport tax which is a joke as countries like Taiwan Hong Kong Singapore Seoul Bangkok already include this in the airfares. Immigration - only 2 counter open in the morning at 7am with at least 60 people queuing despite lots of immigration counters.,5,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Mark Paulton,Australia,"Generally what can be expected from this sort of destination except for the overzealous security staff confiscating bottled water bought from within the departures area (duty free section) of the airport. I proceeded to drink the water and empty the bottle and was still refused to take the totally empty bottle on board! Pathetic. Ground staff and check-in persons are non-existent and nobody was around from Jetstar to talk to over the progress of our 3 hour delayed flight. The boards never updated and the first we knew we were leaving was an announcement of ""Last Call""! There was also one lady to happened to slip (badly) on the very polished marble floors when going out the transfer bus. There was a ground agent standing right next to her but she didn't even assist to get her up or even ask if she was ok. Again just totally bad service and surly people. Spoiled a great holiday.",1,0
denpasar-bali-airport,B English,Australia,Bali was my first overseas holiday people had warned me about the porters that try and grab your bags then want money for it and the guards that could apparently be bribed to get you through the queues quicker and so on. Well we landed in Bali at 10pm and had to walk onto the tarmac. The shuttle bus smelt and we were crammed like sardines all standing up. Three international flights landed at the same time so it was busy. Inside the queues moved quickly staff were rude. The woman that stamped my visa didn't even look at me. The man who x-rayed my luggage was too busy talking and didn't look at the screen at all. All in all it was okay not as bad as I expected. When we were departing from Bali: Late flight home again Jetstar like you to be at the airport a few hours early. There was nowhere for us to check in for a good 30 mins. None of the staff knew what was going on. Got through the rest quickly security were so rude! 20 mins before our flight was due to take off we still didn't have a boarding gate. The information screens were in Indonesian and not one staff member could speak English. Lucky we heard our flight call got to the gate where we were treated to a pat down and bag search before we finally got on our flight.,,0
denpasar-bali-airport,S Stevens,Australia,We landed in the New Denpasar Airport early afternoon. We were bus transported to the terminal we then proceeded through the Visa on arrival passports check etc... The process was absolutely hassle free fast efficient and friendly. Every counter was manned and the lines were only four-five deep so it took no time and we were out at the taxi booth paying a fixed price for a Taxi to our Villa in Seminyak (au $10.00). After reading many very disturbing reviews about the airport departure process we decided to get to the airport early. We went to the airport by taxi and arrived 3 hours before our 11.30pm flight. We have travelled extensively around the world and been to many international airports and Bali airport was one of our better experiences. The booking in immigration passport check luggage checks all worked well with very little delay. The food prices in the airport were more expensive than on the streets of Kuta but that is typical of any airport. The shopping section cannot be avoided the walkway winds through the shops this not unusual in airports. Once we got to the departure lounge I found a lot of congestion many people were sitting on the floor. We had not been allocated a departure gate and the flight details board did not have the departure gate numbers listed for many of the flights this caused congestion. We simply walked past all the congestion to another group of departure lounges (plenty of empty seats) and we waited for the announcement telling us which was our departure lounge. The announcements were loud and clear. There were many spotlessly clean toilet blocks throughout the departure lounges in the airport. I strongly recommend once you get to the departure lounge area walk to the left past the congestion and you will find many empty departure lounges and empty toilet blocks. We look forward to going back to Bali and seeing the airport when it is completely finished.,9,1
denpasar-bali-airport,Wendy Hill,Australia,I travel to Bali every year and have done so for the past 15 years. Last year I went through the old airport and as I left in a taxi I saw the lovely new one next door thinking 'gee that looks nice pity it wasn't finished for this year'. This year I got to experience the fancy new one - how could they have got it so wrong. To be honest it wasn't too bad arriving but with multiple planes arriving at the same time it is confusing which carousel to collect your luggage from. We were lucky our bags came out first so we were then able to move to the next point - having them x-rayed for clearance. This is confusing as you need to go need to double back to put your bags through the machine before moving forward to the declaration inspectors. There wasn't signs telling you to do this and many people who collected their bags moved forward through the gate to the inspectors as you would expect to do but were yelled at by a security guard to go back to the x- ray machines. If these machines were at least on the way to the declaration station this would cause less chaos. Everyone is told by the airlines to get to the airport at least 2 hours before departure which in all the years I have travelled overseas to a variety of countries has made good sense. When departing from the Bali Airport arrive at least 3 hours early with your fingers crossed and a good book. On arrival you will be asked if you want your bags wrapped in plastic if you do then allow more time again. Most people I noticed didn't take up this option me included. When you make your way to the check in counter ASK someone which one as they put the wrong signs up. We were leaving on a Virgin flight @ 22.10 to Melbourne on flight VA54. The 3 check in desks displayed Brisbane 21.20 pm VA 58. After some confusion and wasting time looking for our flight I eventually asked 3 people including other passengers and was told the signs are wrong it's the Brisbane desk where the Melbourne flight is. Getting into line @ 7.30 it took until 845 to be processed. Initially there was 3 desks open but shortly after standing in line one was closed leaving only 2 desks to process both the Brisbane and Melbourne passengers. Now having received our boarding passes it indicated plane boarding time is @ 9.25 Gate 10. Next is the need to pay the Rp200000 departure tax at another counter which was done efficiently and quickly IF you had the right money. Next was the immigration centre where about 600 or more people had lined up waiting to be processed. Having waited over an hour in the last queue my heart sank stressing I had less than an hour to board my plane. Amazingly this process was quite quick as fortunately they had about 8 desks all processing people quickly. After passing through Immigration you can not avoid the Duty Free and every other hugely overpriced shop as to get to the departure gates you must wander or run in my case through all of these. I wanted to do some Duty free shopping but unfortunately this was no longer an option as my plane was now boarding. If you want to go to the toilet before boarding good luck it if you are female. There is only one sign for toilets and the line up was enormous. As I wanted to change into warmer clothes for the flight back and unable to get into the toilets I managed to change behind a pot plant! We were then ushered down stairs and loaded and packed onto buses like sardines and driven out to the plane where you walk up stairs . Having taken our seats we had to wait for 2 more bus loads of passengers before finally leaving late. Like others are saying it does spoil an otherwise lovely holiday. Such a shame but I don't think I'll come to Bali again as there are other tropical places to visit that have happier endings!,2,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Ali Jacques,Australia,"Generally speaking my views are identical to Mr Powell's review below. There were no ""aero bridges"" available for both my arrival flight or my Departure flight. The arrivals hall wad enormous spacious. I had arranged the VIP service through Garuda Orient Holidays so it took around 5 minutes to have my visa in my Passport. When my flight arrived from Brisbane there were already 2-3 International flights that had arrived before mine so was a rather long queue ahead but all Immigration counters were open and fully manned so the queue moved at a steady pace. All luggage came out at the one carousel what a mess. I waited around 10 minutes for my suitcase I was then whisked away to yet another long queue to have all luggage X-rayed. This process over you exit the arrivals hall into the mass of people from Hotels/Tour companies and the like waiting for arriving passengers. The traffic is non stop out of the Airport. Now the Departure information: You are dropped off at a ramp where you can get a trolley for your bags it's a short walk up to the first Security check where your bags are X-rayed takes a couple of minutes. Then if you decide to have your luggage plastic wrapped there are around 4-5 stations where this can be done. The ""check in areas"" are spacious plenty of signage areas A-E and the entire area is spotlessly clean. There are no restaurants/Cafes in the Check in areas a huge mistake as there were many passengers in need of a cup of coffee. After check in there was ample seating in the Departure/Check in areas whilst waiting. After check in you walk the short distance where you pay the IDR 200000 Departure tax (A$20.00). The waiting tine at this point was only a couple of minutes. Then more Security screening separate lines for both men and women moved quickly. Then we have the shopping Duty Free and a lot of high end makes Designer and beautifully displayed very impressive. They are set out whereby all passengers must pass by every single shop. There are a few restaurants as you pass by the endless shopping a little expensive but convenient. The Gate areas are well laid out but the carpet is somewhat worn. The Boarding gates they cannot get it ""right"" too many passengers running all over the place with the constant changes. The worst gate being Gate 10 where the majority of Aussie bound flights depart from and as in my case my Garuda Indonesia flight to Brisbane was scheduled to also depart from this gate along with 4 other flights on Virgin Australia Jetstar bound for Perth Adelaide and Melbourne. It was total chaos. Headed down the escalator to yet another holding area where all passengers on the four flights were jammed in like sardines with airport staff screaming out the flights to a lot of confused people never seen anything like it in my 40 years of traveling. The airport may be lovely when first observed but the organization of the Departure/Gate areas require urgent attention. My holiday in Bali was just wonderful but with the airport debacle at the end put a sour taste to my Bali experience. Just for your information I arrived in Bali on Friday 7th March 2014 and departed on Friday 28th March 2014.",8,1
denpasar-bali-airport,Norm Powell,Australia,"They have spent a lot of money on ""upgrading"" Denpasar airport but IMO the overall effect has been to make it worse than the old airport. I have travelled to Bali many times and was quite familiar with the old airport so feel qualified to comment. Arrivals have gradually improved over the years. The VOA is much quicker than it used to be the immigration desk is generally quicker although bottlenecks and delays do occur from time to time. Sometimes the bags are off the carousel before you get to them but at other times there can be a short delay. Overall arrivals are OK. The Departures area looks impressive as you first enter. Signage is pretty good although the sign for our check-in desk was wrong. The Virgin check-in desk had only three people on duty and was handling flights to both Sydney and Melbourne at the same time causing delays. The departure tax desks are now very close to the check-in desks and are a huge improvement on the old desks upstairs. Security is segregated male/female causing some confusion as people queue in the wrong line. Then you come to the Immigration department and from this point onwards the new airport is a failure if not a disaster. Long queues at emigration control then down this channel of shops/duty free whose quality is poor yet whose prices are so much higher than the street prices in Bali. Food choice is very poor food and drink prices are over the top such as a can of soft drink being more than treble the price on the street. Then you come to the chaos of the waiting area. There are inadequate seats and passengers sit on the floor in great crowds blocking access to the gates etc. Even though its a new space it is grubby and shabby. Long queues for ladies toilets but not for mens toilets. Once the flight is called it is a mad rush to more queues at the departure gate and another security check which seems pointless since it is very cursory. I bought a bottle of water after passing the main security check and after checking with the vendor walked four paces to the second security check and had the water confiscated! Then its down the steps to a holding area and here it was crazy. A throng of people aiming for two different flights heading to the same door; staff members yelling/screaming trying to get some sense of order. Then on to the jam-packed little bus that takes you to the plane. Only after boarding the plane can you breathe easy once again. I absolutely love Bali but this departure mess is a sad way to end what otherwise was a great trip.",1,0
denpasar-bali-airport,J Pangini,United States,I arrived at DPS around noon last week. It literally took me 14 minutes from plane purchase of VOA immigration and customs. Granted we were the first flight that had arrived in about 45 minutes and I was in business class so I was the first one off the plane. However the entire system worked extremely well with friendly staff baggage waiting for me on the belt (10 minutes after landing) and a quick and easy customs. I had some friends that were forced to wait an hour or so because of arrival during a peak time but overall the new airport is beautiful and works very well for arrivals. I did not depart Bali from the airport so I cannot comment on departure.,10,1
denpasar-bali-airport,Robert Marsden,Singapore,"The New International Airport Arrivals - 4 star plus experience. Huge improvement on Old terminal. But International Departures dramatically worse than the old one. A very poor departing experience. Full of Low Cost Flyers having to wait hours lying all over the [dirty] carpets. Gate Management is chaos. Never like this in Old terminal [10x better]. Shopping ""snake alley"" - a bit too obvious forcing all departing pax to walk - and 95% nothing from Bali. Facilities - some toilets as good as any anywhere. Carpet - fine if it's going to be pulled and thrown out 31st March latest. Yes understand work is still in progress - but January [1 hour + to get in first checkpoint] and even late March 10 mins plus. Some real hard changes definitely needed and none difficult. The last view of Bali needs to be the lovely happy relaxed and lasting Balinese experience.",,0
denpasar-bali-airport,S Karla,Australia,After reading bad reviews we were dreading our trip to Bali but were pleasantly surprised! After leaving Perth airport (a disgraceful small airport with non existent facilities) we arrived in Bali at 4.25pm along with 2 other flights. The visa on arrival desks were plentiful with smiling attendants. Then onto customs/immigration which were a bit slow but once again friendly officers. Our baggage was already on the carousel so we were out of the airport and into a taxi within 10 minutes.,9,1
denpasar-bali-airport,D Olsson,Australia,My review will be less inflammatory than others because I have the good fortune to only ever use Bali airport at off-peak times. So I'll acknowledge that it's a massive improvement over the old terminal. There's more space and it's much more comfortable and attractive. There were still hints that despite spending a lot of money on a new terminal they still didn't cater to the existing demand (immigration took 20 minutes and there was a relative lack of seating airside otherwise things moved quickly). There are definitely still problems - hopefully some are temporary - that people should be aware of. Most flights are using buses at the moment and the terminal entrance where they drop you has 2 big steps and no wheelchair ramp - I saw 3 staff struggling to get a disabled guy up them. We didn't get arrival cards on the plane and there is very little in the immigration hall to tell you that you need one or where to get one (there were piles on some - but not all - of the VOA counters) plus there was one single desk in the entire cavernous hall where you could fill them out. Signage is not finished (or it's intended to be terrible) and it can be hard to see how to get from arrivals to departures (with a new terminal they really should have catered for airside connections) or where the taxi booth is. There are rigorous security checks before AND after check-in - the first one seems like an afterthought since there isn't enough room to do it smoothly. There are no ATMs in departures so if you forgot the R150000 departure tax (I had miscounted and I ended up R500 short!) it's back down to arrivals and then through security again. And what is the stupid serpentine gauntlet of shops that you have to run to get to the gates? I wonder where this horrible trend started - I know Sydney's done it for decades (but mainly in arrivals). All up a massive improvement over the old terminal in off-peak times.,6,1
denpasar-bali-airport,P Ensor,Australia,Just had my first experience with the new airport. Still a few bugs to be ironed out but I think it's not so bad. On arrival we had to get bussed to the terminal we had pre arranged express visa but there wasn't really a line at immigration anyway. It's well worth it at peak times though. As usual priority business tags on bags were not first out. It also meant there was a short wait to have the bags screened upon exit. We were then shown to our car by the express visa girl which wasn't far and were away. After reading all the negative reviews about departure I was prepared for long lines. It wasn't too bad. First line to get into terminal to pass baggage screening was about 10 minutes. There was a long line at Virgin check in but was no one in business class line so I was straight through. The next line stop was departure tax with pretty much no wait at all. The customs line was the longest probably about 15 minutes. They have free wifi at the terminal so wasn't so bad. Two extra staff would have made this a breeze. Seems to be a few complaints about the shopping strip you have to walk through. There's all you usual duty free here at exorbitant airport prices. Made my way to the temporary lounge. The furnishings are very nice and comfortable the food selection is basically the same as the old lounge. Very limited and not high quality but pretty much standard for most of Asia. It was pretty much at capacity when I arrived and was annoyed that they were letting in people paying to enter. A couple of flights were called and it soon cleared out. The lounge wifi didn't work at all but the free wifi provided by the airport was great. On departure bags were once again scanned and the plane was on a sky bridge so boarding was quick and easy. Things are certainly not as bad as previous reviews have encountered. I did love the outdoor terrace garden at the old airport lounge hope they have a similar setup once the new business lounge is complete.,6,1
denpasar-bali-airport,C Roth,Singapore,"I fly to Bali regularly. Wasn't a fan of the old airport inefficient gloomy shopping areas etc. I was hopeful seeing the new shiny airport. This cost a lot of money but is no improvement. Immigration queue ~2 hours with a ""VIP"" fast track for 25 USD. Gate shown barely 30 minutes before departure. Very little seating space. Poor cafe options with no appetizing food options and unappealing seating. Very long shopping mile which you have to walk through too few gates for number of departures. Very poor passenger management at gate. Two flights to Singapore were located at the same gate all passengers from both flights herded into the tiny gate area (no seating whatsoever) and staff tried to sort out by shouting. Staff were giving attitude to passengers who did not immediately understand the crazy sorting of passengers. Incompetent crazy passenger traffic management. Good points? The bookstore (Periplus) is fine and the toilets are reasonably clean.",2,0
denpasar-bali-airport,A Beasant,Australia,Arrival okay just slow. Departure horrible. Queues long and they must try to employ the rudest staff they can find. Cash only for departure tax and yet no one thought to provide an ATM. Once through had lunch at the closest sit down cafe only to be served an awful club sandwich. No decent food places and nowhere else to sit. Bags opened by security many times and queues for everything. Worst international Airport available. If the staff were at all friendly it would at least make the lack of facilities bearable. Indonesia should be ashamed of this effort on such a beautiful place.,,0
denpasar-bali-airport,B Vincent,Australia,"I passed through the new Bali airport in November without any problems so some of the reviews below got me a little anxious for my January trip. Arrival at about 5pm wasn't too bad VoA payment was quick Immigration not as quick but there was a fair queuing system in place and it only took 20 minutes to clear. My departing flight was at 1am so I made sure to reach the airport by 10pm. Check-in departure tax and Immigration were all quick - I sympathise with the reviewer that clocked check-in at 20 mins per person but maybe some airlines are better than others. The compulsory walk through the shopping area seems to have got longer funny although signs in the airport say it is ""smoking and tobacco free"" I distinctly remember seeing a tobacco section in the duty free shop. After the shopping area things start to show signs of stress; too few toilets with queues spilling out VIP lounges just fenced-off departure lounges; not enough seating people all over the floor. There are a few food stalls which look pretty temporary but prices are close to western airport prices. Surprisingly there is free drinking water to be had but only a couple of dispensers and supplies were running low. No information counters and no PA speakers in the toilet. Clearly the new terminal isn't really ready yet but all this said my experience could have been a lot worse.",6,1
denpasar-bali-airport,L Russell,Singapore,New airport looks similar to the old one just a bit bigger. Arrival was fine (after some past horrendous experiences we always opt for the express service). The real horror story was departure. Massive queues total chaos. I was timing how long it took them to check in each passenger and no joke the average time was 20 minutes! For each passenger! Flight departed 3 hours late. Flight crew were apologetic saying they were ready to go on time but the incompetents at check in couldn't do their job. Disgrace. Funny thing is departure was ok at the old terminal.,,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Lisa Verney,Australia,We are frequent visitors to Bali and the new terminal is a delight in comparison to the old for arrivals. The service is pretty much the same (slow) and the baggage collection is a worry (especially when 3 planes luggage all unloaded on to 1 carousel. After our first trip we learnt about VIP express - for me its worth the additional $25USD. Departing is a nightmare lined up like cattle to enter terminal once you get in the door there is limited seating. Our last trip had 4 planes leaving within 10 minutes of each other to Brisb Melb Perth all flights checked in a same time through 3 counters people everywhere - total chaos. The departure tax counter poorly signed. Once actually through the formalities things don't get any better minimal seating limited food and beverages available untidy PA garbled. All in all they have a way to go before it is world class.,5,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Jim Kelly,Australia,Worst check-in experience ever. 45 minutes standing sweating in a line leading into the terminal to get bags scanned. Finally into air conditioned terminal but total chaos at Jetstar counter. Four flights leaving no direction to queues and another 1.5 hour wait. Only one person checking in the Perth flight. About 40 mins before the flight is due to leave someone finally comes out and asks if anyone is traveling to Perth. Yes says I us and the other 100 people standing in the line behind me. At last through to the next queue and a 20 minute wait in another line to pay departure tax before joining the next line to get through customs. My wife would have gone to the toilet but the flight was already being called and there was yes you guessed it another long queue to the ladies extending out into the waiting lounge. But there was time for one last pointless bag check and body check before we went through the boarding gate. The person in front of us was complaining that the experience was so bad he would never visit Bali again. This airport is a national embarrassment. After sitting on the plane for 20 minutes the pilot announced that the ground crew had disappeared he couldn't raise anyone and we weren't going anywhere. Turned out the baggage conveyer belt had broken down and the bags were being moved manually. Total fiasco.,1,0
denpasar-bali-airport,W Bates,Australia,We departed Denpasar on first day of new facility. The hotel transport delivered us to the wrong area. When we got to the departure gate the staff directed us to the right area. We were uncertain how to get there and enquired at the Garuda desk. They were very friendly and arranged for us to be taken to the correct gate by buggy for which we were very grateful. The new departure area was large cool clean and I loved the clock. The staff were being abused especially as there was no duty free shopping by some of the travellers and I found it very embarrassing as it was their first day in the facility. All the staff were doing their best.,10,1
denpasar-bali-airport,R O'Brien,Australia,Bali tourism is bound to suffer as a result of the operational fiasco in the new airport. It took my family over 1.5 hours to get through security customs etc and to the departure gate. There are separate security screening points for males and females so I was separated from my sons - is this a religious thing? The queues were ridiculous with less than half the staff required at the checkpoints making the waiting endless. When we got to the departure gate there were people sitting on the floor and around 100 seats cordoned off - the staff had no reason for this. If travel time to and from Bali is going to continue taking hours longer than necessary tourists will start to go elsewhere.,3,0
denpasar-bali-airport,K Green,Australia,"We flew into Bali on 26 December. We didn't have any real problems with VOA Immigration and Baggage collection. No doubt we were the only flight in at that time. On the way out of Bali - 2nd January it was another story. The first security screening was grossly inadequate. The queues were massive and as there appeared to be only 2 x-ray points it took forever. I pity the poor tourists in front of us who waited for approx. 45 minutes in the queue to be told they were in the international departures area not domestic. No signage of course. Once through the first security screening it was another long wait to check in. Purchase of the departure tax was quick but the next queue through immigration was very long and slow. There were more people collecting the departure tax than there were checking at immigration! The fact that we are now forced to walk through an enormous duty free ""hall"" is annoying. Whilst it appears most airports are doing this it would be nice to bypass them. There are no restaurants just a couple of cafes with a couple of tables each and a couple of ""hot dog stands"". There is little seating and plenty of people were sitting on the floor. You can't go to your departure gate to sit down because you don't know which one you are allocated to until it is announced. Once at the departure gate the duty free purchases were wheeled in on a flat bed trolley!!! We had to get on buses to board the plane. The first two buses delivered passengers and then didn't reappear with new passengers for an hour. The airport is not finished is not staffed sufficiently or correctly and the services are non existent. The whole airport experience was horrific. Next time I go to Bali I will pay someone to express us in and out.",1,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Rose de Graaf,Australia,We arrived in the New Airport in September and it was chaos. Not enough staff and it took 2 hrs to get through immigration. Just back from another trip in Dec/Jan 2014 and this time in the Arrival and Departure Lounge chaos. Arriving a worker was haggling for money and he would get you straight through. We didn't accept but 2 hrs later wished I had slipped him a few dollars to take me through. Saw about 10 people being escorted through by this guy. Will be looking for him next time. No staff again. Departing we got there 3.5 hrs earlier because we wanted to look around the new airport and have a relaxing meal/drink if possible but no. We got to the gate 35 mins before boarding and no meal yet. My husband is diabetic so that was a problem but got some snacks quickly before we boarded. To book in there was a huge throng of people all en masse and as you got closer to the booking in of baggage the masses parted and tried to choose the correct lane for their particular flight. People were arriving and just going to the front of the queue and we witnessed a couple of fierce arguments from frazzled travellers. Then even if they were in the right queue they were crossing over to the first vacant line. Bedlam. Again only one staff for each planeload. The plane was delayed 45 mins due to travellers still trying to get processed. Very poor organisation.,,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Anthony Tickle,Qatar,Waited 1.5 hours to get into the airport through security screening. Moving walkway had no emergency stop and passengers were injured as there was no room at the top to step off. No staff managing people. Food outlets very poor. No seating available and not enough seating throughout the airport. Hundreds of passenger sitting on the floor. Business lounge disgusting. Dirty floor and chairs. Little food. No utensils. No glasses. Few drinks in the fridges yet few people in the lounge. Not possible to get luggage from car-park to departures as ditches and high kerbs prevent you get luggage across the roads. Poor signage and no staff managing the queues. Quality of finishes in a new airport the worst I have seen in a long time. No wonder tourist numbers are dropping off in Bali. Unacceptable airport and its new.,,0
denpasar-bali-airport,C Finn,Singapore,I travel a lot for business and pleasure and have got used to the peculiarities of airports in countries with little experience of how to run one. However Bali seems to have gone into reverse. The old airport was cramped and a bit lacking in facilities but at least it wasn't hard to navigate. The new airport has clearly been opened long before it was ready but even that cannot make up for the staggering and embarrassing disaster that they now have in place. The other posts have covered most of the points (no food no seats nothing working etc) so I won't labour them again but just to say that I have been though airports in third world African countries that were better. The only bright spot was the Balinese themselves who are unfailing polite and smiley. However this was such a bad experience it would be a factor in deciding whether I visit Bali or one of the many other destinations in the region next time.,,0
denpasar-bali-airport,S Majid,Malaysia,Airport upgrading still ongoing. If you arrive during mid-day the chances are you will have eight back-to-back flights with 2000 passengers arriving between 11.30 to 1.00 pm in DPS. We paid for VIP Arrival Service which means we were whisked away passed the extremely long queue at immigration to the luggage collection point. Yes the luggage took some time to arrive but the immigration queue was much worse. The airport lacks seating facilities the Premium Lounge was a make-shift sitting area bordered by temporary partitions and there was no facility for kids. Truly an airport that tests your patience.,3,0
denpasar-bali-airport,D Johnson,United Kingdom,Avoid this airport at all costs if you can. Transit through this airport should also be avoided unless you want to stand around for hours with very limited seating and very limited facilities. You have been warned!,,0
denpasar-bali-airport,R Arzah,Canada,What a disgrace. We arrived at the new terminal and it has none of the charm and grace of the island. The VOA process is fast but the immigration queue was the worst of any airport I have ever seen (and I have visited some bad airports) it took us about 2 hours to get through. Over half the immigration counters were not staffed and there appeared to be no supervision. There is apparently an express service that allows people to jump the queue I have never seen such a thing.,,0
denpasar-bali-airport,S Gautan,United Kingdom,We touched down at 1530 and there was another international flight that had just landed. Visa on Arrival process is very quick there are 12 agents serving and so it doesn't take long at all. However it does mean that anybody on the plane who doesn't need a VOA gets to join the immigration queue ahead. We arrived at the queue and were faced with around 400 people ahead of us. I estimated the waiting time to be around 60 mins minimum. There were 8 immigration agents working but a little slowly. I asked a separate agent who was directing passengers for 'Express Service' and bargained him down to USD 45 for the three of us. Took 5 mins to clear immigration (he took us to a separate queue counter) and pick up our bags. No hassle out of the airport in 15 minutes. Just remember if you don't want a particular service be polite and firm. They all respect that - no umms uhs buts etc. Get straight to the point and don't waiver. Otherwise in Bali as they say everything can be 'arranged'. PS - This was my first trip with our young son who was a bit hungry and ill and I needed to exit the airport quickly.,8,1
denpasar-bali-airport,Andrew Muir,Australia,The newly constructed airport terminal at Bali is a disgrace. There is minimal seating so persons are forced to resort to the floor. The disembarkation arrangements are pure farce. I arrive on Garuda ex Tokyo in the evening. It was raining heavily as the movable walkways do not seem to be operational passengers had to walk across the tarmac there were 8 umbrellas available for a full A330-300. Designers have used polished stone in outside areas not a good idea in the tropics. Travelators are not installed at floor level but rather require a ramp up and down. The queues to get into the airport are just as bad as with the old airport.,,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Ian Liversidge,Singapore,Arrived from Singapore with Qatar Airways and into the new terminal. Seemed to be the only flight around so was quickly through the VOA and immigration but despite the lack of other flights baggage took an eternity to arrive. Departure was an absolute joke. Huge queues to even get into the terminal and the first security check. Then check in. Then another queue for a further security check then departure tax and a final queue for immigration. Limited staff on departure tax and immigration. Then the biggest frustration is that there's almost nothing in the way of facilities or restaurants available. The so called business class lounge was very poor. Quite clearly the airport just isn't finished yet. Why they didn't wait I just don't know. Overall a poor experience and worse than the old airport if I'm honest.,2,0
denpasar-bali-airport,D Smith,Australia,"With the opening of the new terminal I was interested too see if there was an improvement on the old terminal. Sad to say no brand new building but the with no improvement in customer service. On departure we where herded through to the old terminal which looked like it had been stripped of anything useful. Stifling hot with 3 flights crowded into the same area. When I arrived back I was disheartened to see approx 400 people in front of me waiting for a visa. There seemed to be more people asking you for express service (fee) than manning the immigration desks. Along with the hundreds of others spent a few hours queuing to get in. Then there was the question ""where's my luggage"" so of course you walk from belt to belt to find your luggage. Welcome to the land of smiles.",2,0
denpasar-bali-airport,S Douglas,Australia,Arrived and departed from new International Airport. We arrived on 7 October during APEC and were required to catch a bus to walk 10 metres as we didn't exit via air-bridge which was surprising as we flew Garuda. Quick transition through immigration but it took over 40 minutes for the bags to arrive. We were the only flight arriving during this period. Another scan was required and took another 30 minutes. Very disorganised. For departure from Bali the Airport is in utter chaos! If the airport isn't finished don't open it as the old terminal worked just fine. Confusing setup currently with security before check in departure tax counter another security check and then finally immigration. This is where the buck stops! Nothing completed! No food options and my guess is the airport is only 50% completed. Absolute disgrace to call this place a airport. Hang your head in shame! Keep the old terminal open until the new one is finished. Probably the worst airport in the world at present.,,0
denpasar-bali-airport,M Henry,Australia,Flew from Brisbane AU. It was still organized chaos. Arrived in Bali at 2.30pm which was one of their busiest times and were delayed in the air for an hour. Transferred to the terminal by bus. Buying the Visa on Arrival (US25 each) went fairly quickly but the wait to get through Immigration took much longer. Airport is quite humid and hot with no air-conditioning. There was a delay in getting our luggage took an hour and no signage so confusion as to which conveyer belt was ours. Immigration staff were ok and friendly to our son. Lots of touts trying to take your bags etc but just watch your bags and give a firm no. The pick up area was crazy but we found our pre-paid taxi fairly quickly. Leaving Bali there is a quite a long walk from drop off to the entrance and luggage touts are everywhere. We couldn't find any carts nearby so I gave in and paid a tout 30000 Rph ($3) to carry our bags (for 5 people) to the entrance. Had to wait a while to get past the first security checkpoint which was a pain and a bit stressful. Arrived a little early for check-in (9pm) and had to wait 15 minutes. We then paid our exit fee (150000 Rph / $15) and got through Immigration after about an hour. warm. Airside I had thought we could enter the best of 3 lounges (Premier Lounge) but was told by as we were not affiliated with their partner airlines. So we went to the cheaper one on the other side (Marigold Lounge) but it was only 150000 Rph ($15). Facilities were ok seats reasonably comfortable food choice was a bit limited (rice noodles sandwiches cakes and pastries and coffee free beer but what do you expect - its only $15). Lighting was a bit dark for me. Large flat screen TV to keep you entertained. Free WIFI. Toilets / showers are located at the back outside the lounge and were basic. We spent about 1-2 hours there. Staff were friendly. We had to go through a final security check just before the gates. Limited seating at the boarding gate so we stood around for about 30-40 mins before getting onto our flight. So our experience at Bali Airport wasn't too bad overall just need to be aware of the chaotic environment.,5,0
denpasar-bali-airport,C Tung,United Kingdom,Arrived at Bali late afternoon with Malaysia Airlines. Had arranged VIP service so arrival experience was great. Walk straight through the immigration. However if you are not arriving at the peak hours save your money. The queue wasn't too bad at all. I was also surprised how fast they deliver luggage to the belt. The meeting points for pick up was chaotic. I have never seen an airport so busy. Even if you stay at a 5* hotel you might have difficulty in locating your driver. Traffic leaving the airport was bad but that was part of the Bali experience – chaotic order. Leaving the airport was a bit easier. Took a midday flight and it wasn't the peak period at DPS. Before proceed to the check in area we were asked to show our ticket. I was bit amused since nowadays who would have a paper ticket? Luckily they just wanted to confirm that I was actually a passenger so my iphone calendar with flight number confirmed that. Luggage drop was easy no queue and was handled by a very friendly lady. The departure hall was larger than I expected with a lot of shops. Most of them overpriced but that’s the same in all airports in the world. Terminal building is very dark and not interesting so I went straight to the lounge.,5,0
denpasar-bali-airport,T Maddern,Australia,The check-in area for international on the ground level is fine but when you get to the departure area through immigration that's where things go bad. Seating is very poor and rather than create areas with windows the airport management have given priority to making it a giant shopping mall full of overpriced goods and people in the walkways continually hassling you for massage services. There are very few seats in the airport despite many empty seats in the numerous eating outlets. If you want to watch the aircraft coming and going you have to go to the gate lounge but you're not allowed into this area until shortly before your flight departs. The cleanliness of the airport is satisfactory and staff are friendly. One other negative thing about the airport is that it is about a 300-500m walk once out of the terminal to the start of the car park. Unfortunately for those of you travelling to Bali - this is the only airport option. On the positive side - there is the selection of a new airport building and a couple of cranes so hopefully in the next 3 - 10 years this will be completed with adequate windows and runway viewing areas.,2,0
denpasar-bali-airport,G van Glabbeek,Netherlands,I really like this airport it really is Bali in a nutshell. I read people complaining about porters and immigration officers who let you walk past the line for $25 extra. Those people have to understand that that is just how Bali and frankly Indonesia in general is. Westerners don't usually understand the approach of these porters they can seem intimidating. In the end it's of course money that makes the world go round but a part of them is genuinely trying to be helpful.,7,1
denpasar-bali-airport,R Tan,United States,The domestic terminal of this airport is in desperate need of serious upgrades. The waiting areas are overcrowded with seats that are not well maintained. The check in area looks very unappealing. Also the check in staff need to tell passengers to ensure that they pay airport tax as there is no clear signage about it. I had to go back to pay the airport tax before I could proceed airside.,4,0
denpasar-bali-airport,C Kear,Australia,"What a badly designed badly run and expensive place to travel through! US$25 per traveller coming into Bali and $15 in Rupiah going out. The drop off/pick up points are a couple of hundred yards from the international terminal. This means you have to run the gauntlet of greedy porters and it also means trouble for anyone with less than perfect physical fitness. Strangely there seem to be pick up lanes just outside the terminal which have been closed off and disguised with large pot plants. Coming into Bali airside you are presented with a line of men in casual clothes who will short cut the immigration line (and also allow you to bypass the mandatory fingerprinting of visitors) if you pay them an extra fee. Then it's a case of fighting through the porters and the mystery of locating the pick up point to leave the campus. Leaving Bali there is the security check as you enter the terminal (not sure why) followed by heaps of expensive shops and several so-called business class lounges which in fact are just lounges which bargain against each other to try and get you to pay enter and use their services. You'll be generally badgered by retailers and lounge staff as you move through. However where staff are genuinely needed at the second set of security checks before the gates you'll find a paucity with the predictable enormously long lines. I arrived 3 hours before my flight and despite doing no shopping or ""lounging"" I only just boarded my plane in time. The second security check had 3 staff checking hand baggage and passengers for 3 flights. Then another ""open your bag"" security check at the gate itself. Denpasar is a horrible airport set out to extract the maximum amount of cash from unwary travellers and it can at times feel threatening. I've never been through such a bad experience when travelling. I couldn't come up with a similarly bad airport.",1,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Karl Parkes,Australia,Arrived by Garuda who have really lifted their game. However organised chaos would be a good description. Earlier comments re porters is true airport authorities need to take a more proactive attitude and not be complacent. Departures information boards are sketchy there is practically no public seating so I stood and walked around for 2 hours. Went out to a plane in a bus during pouring rain.,2,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Dominic Olsson,,Clearly not designed for the numbers of people it handles. However I was there in low season and I think staff at least make a good attempt at moving people through efficiently. The biggest problem is the huge distance from the terminal to drop-off points with touts all along the way. Also the prices in the airport are the same as western airports (despite Bali being otherwise very cheap).,4,0
denpasar-bali-airport,N Watson,Australia,A total circus at the airport immigration wait was not too bad although very unfriendly at the Visa Section. The Porters are a total joke! We ended up with 5 Porters holding onto our two bags and all demanding copious amounts of US dollars for handling them. We found the Porters intimidating to say the least! Completing the checking in process took an age so my advice would be to leave sufficient time prior to boarding.,1,1
denpasar-bali-airport,C Effe,Australia,Make sure to use the toilets on the plane the next toilets will be before immigration but that could leave you even further towards the end of the queue. It will be hot in the immigration hall and there are no seats. The entry visa of US$25 can be paid in rupiah. Would always recommend to get transfers organized by the hotel not an external company. Departing from Denpasar get there in time as immigration can again take quite a while. Sitting in the final waiting area before departure can get confusing as there are only printed paper signs with your flight number stuck up. Wait outside the boarding gate until the flight has been called a few times.,6,1
denpasar-bali-airport,S Hedden,United States,I got to experience both transfer and local arrival and departure. Arrival was fine. I had read horror stories about Visa on Arrival procedure especially with several flights arriving around midnight but process was smooth and fast. Everything is clearly marked pay for Visa process immigration then exit through customs. All desks were open and took 10 minutes. Transferring to domestic flight had to walk outside to domestic terminal. Domestic terminal is a bit haggard and worn with struggling aircon but well labelled and efficient. Must have Rupiah to pay departure tax. Lots of Taxi touts on exit but just refuse and proceed to taxi desk where rates are preset. Departing from international terminal was smooth but all the shops burning incense inside makes the air quite acrid and there is no place to sit until about a half hour prior to departure when you are finally allowed inside your gate area.,7,1
denpasar-bali-airport,J Vandenberg,Australia,Flew into Bali December 2011 with Virgin arriving on time at 2.30pm. As I expected this to be a busy time in customs and immigration and being a senior lady I'd prepaid $25 to be met by concierge services at the entrance to the arrival hall. Transfer from the plane to the hall was by bus. I was in the second bus and on arrival no Bali Concierge representative to be found and no one holding up my name. I walked around enquiring about the company and looking for assistance but no one knew this company and no help was in sight. I bought my own visa continued through immigration on my own collected my own luggage and passed through customs. This probably took only 30 minutes so wasn't particularly busy and I was very lucky. The following day I SMS'd the Bali Concierge services who requested what my arrival flight details were assured me they were at the airport from 11am to 11pm and if I'd like to use them for departure it would cost me another IRP125000. Needless to say I did not use the company again and have put this down to another of the Bali scams. So be warned obviously hoping to make the entry to Bali easy doesn't always work.,6,0
denpasar-bali-airport,A Aigner-Muehler,Australia,Arrived Sunday lunchtime. Very humid. Lines are ridiculously long at immigration on arrival it took us 45 minutes to clear. Once through the baggage carousal is not clear you need to ask what carousal your luggage is coming off. Once you walk out of the airport there are no signs for shuttle buses to hotels nor is there a taxi bay. Trying to get information from the information desk is like talking to a brick wall. Unpleasant experience.,1,0
denpasar-bali-airport,J Mackay,Australia,As a frequent traveller to Bali I have got to know it reasonably well and the key to the experience is when you arrive and depart. If you are fortunate enough to arrive from Kuala Lumpur at lunchtime you will have a much better experience than if you arrive in the afternoon when there is a rush of large planes. Same as when you depart. The midnight flights back to Australia are usually packed so expect long delays when you are departing. The queuing for visas and then the queuing for immigration make this one of the worst airports in South East Asia. There is the corrupt VIP service which allows you to skip the lines if you pay an extra $25 each and families often fork out this to avoid hour long delays in non air-conditioned space. There is no duty free on arrival either and as other reviewers have mentioned beware of the porters. The shops when you are leaving though are excellent.,2,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Peter Vincent,Australia,An openly hostile attitude greets travellers at both immigration and customs but my gripe is that the transit lounge has been closed which means that travellers are forced to purchase a temporary visa (US$25) irrespective as to whether their connecting flight departs in five minutes or five days.,2,0
denpasar-bali-airport,G Forrester,Australia,Arrived about 18.30 for our flight to Darwin and had a meal in the main lounge area. The meal was good both my wife and I remained at the cafe for 2 hrs and then moved to the boarding lounge had no problems passing through immigration or any of the security posts. When the boarding call was made for this flight we moved through the check-in down the passage way to the last security post this is where it started to go wrong. A young man on the security check told us we were on the wrong flight during this time he became quite animated using a loud voice. It had now been announced final call and we were still having trouble he maintained that this was wrong and would not listen to us to resolve this I waived an older officer over to sort things out and all was cleared in a matter of minutes.,3,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Brian E Smith,Japan,Depending on arrival time the place can be smooth to get through or backed up for a good hour. Porters are pushy and always around to carry your bag for a fee. Be careful to book your taxi at the counter just outside the greeter area. The airport is sorely in need of renovations. Only two toilets at either end of the terminal shops full of junk smoking allowed in cafes and no wifi. Better hope you have lounge access.,1,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Adrian Adkins,Australia,Arrived late after midnight. Visa on arrival + Immigration took at least 1 hour. Bags had been removed from the carousel by relentless porters. They'll grab your bag before you have a chance to get to it. They shouldn't be allowed inside the customs area- we weren't sure if they were legit airport staff. Had one follow us through customs and direct us to money changer (not great rates). We ditched him without tip because we didn't really want him following us anyway. Taxi queue outside was very long and slow moving. Suggest you arrange a transfer in advance.,1,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Dave Williams,Australia,Pleasantly surprised - both incoming and outgoing - no real hassles crowds or delays - just follow the signs. Arrival to pick up approx 30mins drop off to duty free shopping approx 25 mins. That was in March 2011. Can't say the same about Melbourne arrivals - 1hr 30mins!,4,0
denpasar-bali-airport,M Elizabeth,United Kingdom,Didn't really like the atmosphere around the airport. It was way to crowded and unorganised. There was a very long queue when I had to pay the airport tax and could hardly find anywhere to sit.,3,0
denpasar-bali-airport,N Werner,Switzerland,I was prepared for the worst when I arrived at Bali airport after reading all those terrible reviews. I was arriving on Malaysia Airlines from KL and our flight was delayed for 1 hour. Maybe that was the reason that there was nobody queuing at immigration and we were outside within 20 minutes after arriving. Immigration and customs took no more than 5 minutes as my passport allows for a visa free entrance to Indonesia. Once you leave customs there is a long row of money changers but don't be a fool and change money there. The rates in town are much better. Our arrival was very efficient and I could not fault it except the long walk from our gate to immigration which took about 5-10 minutes as gate 2 is at the far end. Departure was not as good as you already have to pass through security just to enter the building. Check-in was ok and took a while even though we were already checked in online. Paying the exit tax was pretty straight forward and involved no queuing. Once pass immigration there are a few shops but the prices are not competitive if you compare it to other Asian airports in the region. The airport is old but I have seen worse. You pass through security again at your gate and once inside there is nothing much so do not bother going to early. Boarding was civilized but the infrastructure is really outdated. The gate agents set up a microphone and stereo set to announce the boarding calls as the gate did not have a speaker system. I found I was probably very lucky to have this smooth experience in Bali.,4,0
denpasar-bali-airport,J Baker,United States,While expensive I recommend using an arrival concierge service. The mid-afternoon is particularly brutal as multiple widebodies arrive within a few minutes of each other. We arrived took our time walking then met by our agent. He took passports and visa fee then escorted us past immigration to where we waited for luggage. Around the time it came off he appeared with our passports. So we're talking 15 minutes top which we killed hitting the ATM and bathrooms. He then helped us to the front of the final xray queue then past the hawkers and helped us locate our driver. $30 per person but worth it.,4,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Andreas Dubiella,Germany,Horrible experience waited 1 hour at immigration. On top of that they take 25USD visa fee from you to come into the country and 15USD tax to leave the country. Therefore you get an old ugly airport and chaotic surroundings. For me such kind of handling is unacceptable in a popular tourist destination and we will never go there again and spend our money somewhere else like in Thailand or Malaysia.,1,0
denpasar-bali-airport,G Shepherd,United States,Arrived 17th July absolute chaos. We waited 3 hours in the stuffy immigration hall. At one point an immigration officer waved goodbye to us and left his post - he was not replaced. It appears the whole system is totally overwhelmed - what a welcome to Bali.,1,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Paul Meerman,Netherlands,On arrival horrifying lines at immigration. More than one hour we stood in line and hall was totally overloaded. Baggage was already taken off the carousel and you have to search very good to find your baggage. Outside the airport some money-hunters take your luggage to carry out for a lot of money. Beware! On departure again paying tax. No lines at customs. Inside a lot of shops but expensive if you compare it with Bali itself. This airport needs a huge facelift and some new ways to manage the incoming passengers.,1,0
denpasar-bali-airport,J Bodine,Australia,The Airport in peak season is a shocker. We had a 2 hour wait to get through immigration and only half of the counters were manned. Being pinged USD$25 on arrival and with two small children who were tired and extremely hot - it was an appalling start to the holiday. Due to the massive delay our bags were left unattended on the floor - lucky they were locked. Departure was even worse with some people being charged USD$20 departure tax and one family got ripped for USD$25 per person. For such an established tourism destination I give it a score of 1 out of 10 for the airport. I recommend Phuket anyday - far cheaper on all accounts. Bali Airport Management need to stop lining their pockets.,1,0
denpasar-bali-airport,S Hayes,New Zealand,Not very impressed at all. Expensive entry visa USD25 then a 45 minute queue to move 10 metres. Non airconditioned immigration hall so everyone standing there in queues sweating. Fingerprint machine not going nor was the screening camera so no security scanning of incoming passengers. Hassled by porters trying to grab my case from me to wheel it all of 30 metres to the exit. On leaving exit tax of 150000 rupiah would be better if it were included in the ticket price. Another 45 minute queue this time to pass immigration. Only saving grace is the lounge upstairs which has nice friendly staff and a good range of refreshments. Overall not a great welcoming image for a tourist Island.,1,0
denpasar-bali-airport,L Wotherspoon,Australia,Arriving at 1:15pm it took us 2 hours and 5 minutes to move about 25 metres in the Immigration queue. Each person was being photographed and fingerprinted and it was taking 3-5 minutes per person so if there were 30 people in front of you. By the time we got to the baggage it was all there and had been sitting around waiting for us! At customs we tried to declare some dog food we were bringing in (for donation to BAWA) but he wasn't interested and waved us through. We spoke later with some other people who said the fingerprinting had only just been introduced. Not sure if this is correct or not but they clearly didn't have the hang of it. On departure go through security and give up your water bottle. Checkin was quick as there was no queue (Jetstar to Perth). Then another security check. Then we thought we'd buy a bottle of water for the flight (USD1) - figured as we had already given up our water and been through 2 security checks this would be OK. Another security check to get to the gate and they made us give up our newly purchased water. Lots of people in the queue had the same problem. What a waste of money and plastic bottles!,2,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Margaret Hickey,Australia,The Prada Lounge was the best way to enjoy the horrible waiting time at the airport. The staff were friendly courteous and the food and drinks were very enjoyable. I would recommend this lounge as an alternative to sitting in the main area although you will pay for it. Depending on how much you eat and drink as to whether you get your money's worth.,5,0
denpasar-bali-airport,J Leech,Australia,Arrival very frustrating long queues very slow through immigration. Over 3 hours just waiting and wasting valuable holiday time. Hope they can improve service soon. Cannot see why they are understaffed and so slow. Departure from this airport slow so many people at the top of the escalator no room to go. Not as bad as the arrivals though.,1,0
denpasar-bali-airport,John Lynn,,Denpasar - seemed like a brand new terminal (international) - sailed through check in - no longer than 5 mins straight to passport control - no queue paid my 15000 departure tax then into a superbly clean departure area. Many shops and eateries (bit pricey though) - although all outlets charged different amounts for same things. Went to one outlet that wanted 40000 rupiah for a bintang beer another on same aisle with better seating only charged 25000 - it pays to compare). Amusing to see in the gents toilets above urinals a fish tank with tropical fish - novel idea !,5,0
denpasar-bali-airport,S Golledge,,Checking in at Denpasar was chaotic. There seem to be all sorts of so called security checks without sufficient staff and proper facilities. We were travelling Business Class and had access to the Prada Lounge - a joke. The seats are falling apart and dirty there was very little food which was cold and unappetising. There were no clean cups and saucers for about 20 minutes. Outside on the lead up causeway was a man carrying a sign advertising access to the lounge for 100000 Rupiah. Where is the advantage in paying extra for so called business class comfort. If we didn't like Bali so much it would be off my travel agenda just because of Denpasar Airport.,2,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Ian Johnson,,"Arrivals are a nightmare with long lines and the requirement to purchase a visapresent passport and have visa checked. Once through this are pick up baggage (slow) and then walk into a sea of signs and drivers. Not the best experience but through in around an hour at 10.30 on a Sunday night. Departure was much smoother although multiple security checks and searches were interesting. Check in (star class jetstar) was quick as was customs. JAS Business lounge was excellent but boarding aircraft required another two security checks (one x-ray and one by ""Qantas"" security doing bag searches and pat downs. Overall the airport has improved considerably (5 years since my last visit) and in comparison to some other airports I would rate it fair. Note: duty free and shops remain expensive.",3,0
denpasar-bali-airport,Brian Smith,,This airport is dreadful. Security is chaotic immigration takes forever to get through and is understaffed the meeting area for hotel car drivers is too small and crowded and the business class lounge is similarly awful. And what is really infuriating is that they charge 150000 Rupiah to depart. I make annual trips to Bali and I ask myself where does the money go?. A necessary evil I guess.,1,0
denpasar-bali-airport,G Tudor,,Dreadfully long wait on arrival at Denpasar airport. It was pandemonium with many flights arriving on a Friday afternoon and only 4 immigration counters open. Waited in the queues for over two and a half hours - hot and uncomfortable with young children and the elderly particularly suffering. Needs crowd control to organise the traffic of the public as people forgot their manners and queue etiquette went out the window in the stifling conditions. Not good enough considering the enormous amount of tourists providing Bali with an economy. However departure was a much smoother process.,1,0
denver-airport,Marilyn Badolato,United States,"This is addressing the passenger pickup. I have flown in and out of DIA hundreds of times and yet on Sunday, 7/13/15 at 6.30 pm the ""traffic cop"" was clearly out of line and making it impossible for passengers to actually be picked up. She would not allow the cars to stop. This was so absurd I nearly laughed but became furious when she made my daughter drive around once and then again almost a second time because I wasn't actually in the lane of traffic. I know there is not waiting and now parking but there is absolutely no excuse why a car can't actually stop to load the passengers and their luggage. These rules need to be re-addressed.",3,0
denver-airport,Michael Mitchell,United States,The United area for smaller planes was Third world concrete block with swarms of people. We taxied for what seemed like 5 miles. Why is everything so far apart? Why is the Denver airport nowhere near Denver. Even the main terminal was a small bump on the horizon from the area we were in. I will avoid DIA at all costs in the future.,,0
denver-airport,S Francis,United States,I have essentially 2 complaints about this airport. First I can't find an electrical outlet that is not being used. The place is packed with people huddled around electrical outlets. When this place was built people didn't generally walk around with cell phones and laptops - but now they do! This place needs far more charging stations. Finding a socket shouldn't be like going on a treasure hunt. NY JFK has them attached to the waiting chairs at the gates. Now we know Denver is no JFK but all they have to do is add more sockets to the wiring that's already in place. Second the food choices here are worse than those in the GA State Fair. I took two bites of my chicken burrito how can you mess up a chicken burrito? I totally disagree with those complaints about signage - this place is easy to manoeuvre around.,1,0
denver-airport,R Koehler,United States,"Our experience at this airport was very poor. Incredibly slow TSA screening line caused my entire family to miss our flight wait five hours and pay $375 to reschedule. Despite there being maybe 200 people in front of us (two wraps of line) the process took half an hour! Multiple TSA employees appeared to be standing around while only a single screening line operated. Nobody from TSA seemed to have the slightest concern that they were taking far too long and people were at risk of missing their flights. Is there any motivation or reward for TSA employee efficiency? We made the mistake of flying with Frontier airlines. These guys closed the boarding doors 10 minutes prior to departure (we checked our luggage at their counter nearly an hour before departure and that got on the plane just fine). And then happily got $375 to reschedule. As with the TSA what motivation do these people have to actually help passengers? Zero! There are very few power outlets in the terminal (A gates) to plug in phones / laptops. With so many people sitting around (stranded?) it would be nice to have more power outlets! To be fair if you do not have to go through TSA screening and avoid Frontier airlines Denver maybe isn't ""too"" bad.",1,0
denver-airport,Hansi Hartmann,Germany,This is an unprofessional airport. With severe delays on August 9 the airport was an absolute disaster. I have never seen the likes. I will not fly here again.,2,0
denver-airport,F Martin,United States,My biggest complaint with this airport is that the layout was confusing for me on my first arrival in terms of figuring out how to leave the airport and get to the exit I needed to be at. There weren't many maps available to help me navigate so I essentially followed the herd and ended up at the wrong exit even though my pick up was able to find me later on. Amenities are OK. Bathrooms are pretty crowded all the time but it's also a busy airport. Waiting areas were pretty standard.,6,1
denver-airport,A Morrison,United States,Denver airport has flights departing all through the night but amazingly there are no facilities open for their numerous red-eye travellers. Lounges shut at 2100 hours leaving you nowhere to rest or work after that time - apart from the airport floor. Surely extended hours would bring in business and provide more local employment? The airport is vast. It took about 3 hours to get from the gate wait for the train wait for bags wait for bus to the car hire lot travel to the distant lot and pick up our car. Combined with the airports location (on the wrong side of Denver) and the huge traffic jams on I-70 it's impossible to spend much of a weekend break skiing in Colorado.,3,0
denver-airport,B Mallow,United States,I came to Denver on a visit from Philadelphia and expected the same disaster as I did getting here. I would have been dead wrong. Check-in was at about 8.30am finished getting through security at about 9.05. I was shocked. There were easily 300 people in the waiting line and we never stopped moving once. 4 machines working to process people the TSA staff seemed to enjoy their work and were very courteous with their clients. The gates seemed a bit far away but that's to be expected with an airport this big. The restaurants and bars in the terminal were modern and looked clean and well taken care of. The bathrooms were pristine and well stocked. Overall the only thing I found bad about this airport was that one of the electrical outlets didn't work. I'll gladly use it again.,10,1
denver-airport,J Stevenson,United States,I would rate their handicap accessibility as the worst in the USA. I fly fairly often from Midway in Chicago and there is no comparison. Chicago Midway transports wheelchair customers directly to their terminal. Transporting wheelchair people to a cart then waiting on a cement seat for sometimes half an hour is very uncomfortable. I was given a seat on the cart placed on very end without any handle and was trying to hold on to the side of cart as it sped along. To make this trip worse I was driven and left about a block from my terminal and had to walk the rest of the way. Wheelchair staff were rude. I will soon be forced to make this trip to DIA and am dreading it.,,0
denver-airport,Janey Buckley,Australia,We flew from Denver to Indianapolis then La Guardia back to Denver during our motorcycling holiday in America. We found Denver Airport very easy to find our way around spacious and sparking clean and modern. I like the concept of catching a train to our gate rather than those walking escalators most airports seem to have. Plenty of eateries as we had a 5 hour wait. I forgot that I had two mini keyring/penknives in my cabin bag that I had bought at Yellowstone NP which of course showed up at security but security staff were very nice about it and showed me how to post them back to Australia.,10,1
denver-airport,Bob Busch,United States,I want to commend DIA Lost and Found department for getting my bag back to me after I stupidly left it at a hotel shuttle bus pickup island. Within hours they had called the number on my bag to let me know that they had it and after a few emails were able to FedEx the bag back to me. Everyone was so kind and helpful.,10,1
denver-airport,B McCarty,United States,"I've been flying out of here for 14 years. Anyone saying this airport is hard to navigate is sorely mistaken. How hard is it to follow signs and move between 1 terminal and 3 linear concourses? Even gates on one side odd on the other. There is a healthy amount of people but not too many. Look at website to find restaurants. Security can sometimes be a hassle but look at the website and follow the signs to the less crowded checkpoint. Tip: there is a checkpoint at the end of the bridge to Concourse A. If you don't mind a little walk it is often much faster. To the person who took a wheelchair to gate ""E15"": while I have complete sympathy for your plight with the attendant I must point out that there is in fact no gate E15 at DEN. There has in fact never been a single E gate. US Airways does use gates B15/17 in the Star Alliance B concourse and they are quite far from the train stop. However other gates are farther and the moving walkways significantly reduce this travel for most.",9,1
denver-airport,L Smith,United States,It's 9.45pm on a Friday evening I just landed with a 2 hour layover and every restaurant and bar in the place is closed. There was McDonalds which is what I did - and it just closed. The place is crawling with passengers people everywhere and the airport has allowed all food vendors to close. It's absurd.,2,0
denver-airport,Sirey Zhang,United States,Denver is one of the most well organized airports I've ever been to. Extremely clean and organized. Even though there is heavy construction the airport is still smooth to pass through. Check in areas are easy to navigate and security is better run that any other airport in the US. The train is frequent but one good thing is the pedestrian bridge to Concourse A. You can fly to anywhere in the US from Denver but you're limited to mainly United Airlines because UA has a large hub there. Being one of the busiest airports in the US it feels emptier than it is and it's well run with all the chaos that major airports have. Having flown into Denver from both London on British Airways and Frankfurt on Lufthansa customs and immigration are very easy and quick to pass.,10,1
denver-airport,P Armani,United States,Easy Airport to get around very clean and the security line was only about 6 mins. D.I.A. Always seems to have their act together.,10,1
denver-airport,Neill Bell,United States,The airport is continuing to go down hill. Same long TSA queues lack of shops and bars and now the mayor has decided to phase out smoking bars hence many smokers have to stand outside and the smoking bar on concourse A is normally full to capacity. Yet another short sighted move. I think it shows why airports need to be in the private sector as they are elsewhere.,,0
denver-airport,S Weldon,United States,My flights in and out of DIA were later at night (10.30 and 12.20am) so the airport wasn't busy. Pickup and drop off by a family member was quick and easy. It was clean people were friendly and some shops and restaurants were open although it was late. In concourse A the security area is open but I didn't mind. I can imagine the lines get quite long as it is a small area. There could have been a larger seating area at the gate. The intercoms for the other gates can be heard throughout the adjoining gates which led to some confusion. Overall it was comfortable and pleasant.,8,1
denver-airport,D Alley,United States,Do not like traveling through Denver Airport. First time and had to rent a car. Pickup was no problem but drop off we almost froze to death waiting to get on the shuttle to take us to the terminal area the driver stopped at the rental stop which meant we had to cross 4 lanes of traffic/buses to actually access the terminal. Fortunately we did not have any check in baggage only carry on. Thank goodness there was not a snow storm while we waited for the shuttle. The rentals need to build a waiting area for customers. Security was dreadful. It felt like an open air arena for spectators to watch us all disrobe not to mention watch us all put our wallets and purses and technology on open display for anyone on the overhead walk way to make note off. The security area was in the middle of the airport lobby taped off so the wandering spectators did not walk through! In all my travels security areas are completely separated from public view and access unless one is flying. Come on Denver you can do better than this.,4,0
denver-airport,J Paul,United States,The TSA lines are absolutely ridiculous here. Flew Delta twice in past month both times it took 1.5 hours in early am from Homewood Suites to drop off Hertz Car suffer through the Delta Sky Priority ticketing desk and make it through security. Be advised that the Premium lane at TSA moves at 1/3 the speed of the general lanes.,3,0
denver-airport,D Smith,United States,Every time I fly into to DEN the gate of my connecting flight has been changed at the last minute. That would be workable but the flight status monitors do not reflect the change never! I am curious to why DEN needs to make more gate changes than other airports. The issue of the monitors not being up to date has been a long-standing issue with many many airport. Wonder why that is the case.,5,1
denver-airport,K Murphy,United States,I fly through DEN every other week. I know this airport very well. My main complaint with DEN is that it has the worst Internet and phone coverage of any major airport I know of. It is hard to get a phone connection and then hold it for more than a few minutes. The free Internet provided by Boingo is so slow that it is pretty much useless. If you are a business traveler and have any scheduled layover where you will need connectivity plan ahead.,3,0
denver-airport,C Roberts,United Kingdom,DIA continues to slide. I've flown out of this airport for 15+ years and it doesn't get any better. Queues are longer waits for baggage are longer it's crowded and it seems like an unusually large number of flights are delayed. Getting through security can be a nightmare. I'd rather fly through Charles de Gaulle and that's saying something. I'm also shocked at how rude the officials are at passport control. Overall this used to be a very good airport and now it's one of the worst in the US.,2,0
denver-airport,R Rossin,United States,"First time flying out of Denver yesterday. So much airport construction added confusion and roundabout delays to a long drive from town. Flying US Airways printed boarding pass at kiosk and requested wheelchair was soon there (I'm 81 a lifelong flyer but that altitude got me). I had 55 minutes to make it thru security and to the gate. You'd think that was enough time. The man assigned to take me via wheelchair was the most casual person I've ever seen. He strolled so slowly from one end of the enormous terminal past all the shops and eateries to the gate via terminals corridors elevators trains and my gate E15 was the last one naturally. Actually feared missing my plane while my aide sleepwalked along. At E terminal gates are numbered down from 37 to 15. Finally at the gate and the gate agent said ""You just made it."" I was a wreck from trying to get the w/c attendant to speed it up to normal walking speed at least! Gave him a $5 tip anyway but they closed the door after me! Hope I never have to fly in or out of Denver again. There's too much sprawl with no geographical features to hem it in. Never had time to note those murals or to get any food before takeoff though we left Denver at 8 am for a 10.20 domestic flight. Wish I'd had an idea of the vastness of the terminal from check-in to gate. Would have left two hours earlier to enjoy the amenities. A wheelchair is a definite requirement there for an older person though I'm in very good health except for a recently-torn ACL.",2,0
denver-airport,B Scott,United States,Once you are actually in the airport it's lovely. Getting to the airport however is not nearly as pleasant. Flew in and out of Denver in June 2012. On the return from the time we arrived at the rental car return lot it took 45 minutes to get to the gate and the security line was just a couple of minutes. The car rental lots are a long bus ride from the terminal and if you are returning to Terminal West there's now a detour. If you don't need to check in take a bus to Terminal East if you can. Car rental prices at DIA are much higher than in Denver and the taxes are fees are very high - about 25%. If you can pick up your rental car downtown - admittedly not very practical with the transit options to downtown you can save a lot of money. I'm sure the airport works well for connections - but watch out for thunderstorm delays in summer - but for actually visiting Denver it's not very convenient.,5,0
denver-airport,B McCarty,United States,I fly in and out of Denver a few times per year. Security times aren't the fastest but much faster than many other Airports. Check in is very fast and the terminal is easy to navigate. Many restaurants have lots of people but the service is fast so you don't have to wait long. Shops in the concourses aren't very crowded. The airport is built for a higher capacity than it serves so waiting for other planes doesn't take very long. Travel Tip: There are TWO security lines in the main terminal plus an extra in concourse A. The concourse A security can be used no matter which concourse you are flying out of. So just pick the shortest line.,9,1
denver-airport,J Foran,United States,I fly through DEN 3-5 times a year always though B Concourse. While there is a sense of spaciousness because of the high ceilings it is crowded always crowded - thronged would be a better word. The airport sits on a windswept mesa miles from any real services. Woe betide you if you face a spate of cancelled flights in the winter! The place is pleasant enough with a variety of middle of the road food choices but the new smoking lounge in the centre of Concourse B and the DEN Boingo implementation are two real black marks. No smoking lounge can never be made not to smell and when patrons come out the door they carry a powerful cigarette/cigar odour down the corridor with them. As for Boingo when you open a browser on a smartphone Boingo comes up as your only option and though it isn't free it's not obvious how to get past it to search through your cellular device alone. The only way I could find to deal with it was to turn off wireless services. DEN has a much better physical plant than PHX for instance but is nowhere near as traveller- friendly.,6,0
denver-airport,Brett Plueger,United States,I use DIA at least once a month and for a major airport it is a disappointment. For those who travel often you will understand that this an airport that does not cater to you. The so called free wi-fi is unable to perform the simplest tasks and most of the restaurant/bars are so over crowded that you better not be in a hurry. Some are worse than others but I won't mention any names. Fix the wi-fi or at least give me an alternative.,3,0
denver-airport,R Maccuswell,United States,Nice big well laid out airport. Flew in this past week and deplaning was easy no trouble getting into terminal friendly folks to point the way. Return arrived early security took maybe 15-20 minutes tops. TSA were actually pretty friendly. Plenty of shops tram is quick and efficient folks at gate friendly. Only complain is the rental cars are not at the terminal. You have to take a bus about a 10 minute ride out to the car agencies which means you have to account for this upon returning. Better than the other major gateways of NYC and LAX for sure.,7,1
denver-airport,D Ross,United States,The choice of restaurants and shops and the overall cleanliness of the airport was pretty impressive. Even the airport transportation from Pikes Peak parking area to the airport was well co-ordinated with reasonable waiting times. The only drawback is the security line however security staff are pleasant and respectful unlike many other airports.,8,1
denver-airport,N Tyler,United States,After checking my bags at the curb I was unable to obtain a boarding pass. I had to wait to check-in at the gate. I have an artificial hip which usually causes me to set off the old style scanners. After an inefficient wait to have my items scanned I requested to go through the new x-ray machines. I was told no. I was told that it was because I didn't have someone to watch my belongings. I was forced to set off the detector alarms and submit myself to a pat-down in front of hundreds of people. It is a shame that Denver airport leaves such a bad impression in what would have been a pleasant journey. To top it all off since I was detained for so long at security and didn't get my boarding pass at the curb I had to sit at the back of the plane in the middle.,1,0
denver-airport,G Frampto,United States,There is one huge problem with this airport. It is very easy to walk out of the security area without meaning to. I used to live in Denver so when I was scheduled to transit through DIA enroute from Atlanta to Sacramento I decided that I would have dinner at a restaurant in the main terminal that I used to eat at. When I lived there the upper level in the main terminal was part of the secure area - now it isn't. I came out in the main terminal and realized that I was outside the security area. It took me 45 mins to get back inside the security area. Fortunately I made my connecting flight. Needless to say I didn't have dinner. I bet this happens all the time - airport management should put up some signs - lots of other airports do.,1,0
denver-airport,Paul Townsend,United States,I have used DEN 3 times and every time it has been a pleasant experience. Signage has been no problem throughout the terminal and I have always been able to find my way without any problems. The terminal has spacious concourses and it seems to be able to handle the considerable passenger load better than most airports of its size and traffic volume. Some of the carpeting in the terminal is getting a bit faded but the upkeep is very good overall. The security personnel had serious but professional manners and the lines were reasonably short. The distance to downtown Denver is a bit long but not unreasonable (many cities have longer distances).,5,0
denver-airport,M McManus,United Kingdom,Arrived from Dulles. Has three terminals (A B C) and they are connected by a train which is very quick. You could probably get from A to C in 5 minutes on this train although I don't know how often they arrive. TSA security line was very long and slow moving although you can sign up to an express security scheme there for an annual fee so this may be worthwhile for people who frequently go through DEN. After arriving you need to take the train to baggage claim which can be a tedious journey to go to the other side of the airport just to collect your bags. Sign posting for this is not immediately apparent to someone new to the airport. Ground transportation to downtown is plentiful but taxis are expensive ($65). Best to get the $20 airport shuttle bus which your hotel can arrange and which you can pay in cash. ATMs everywhere but they appear not to take Maestro cards so be warned. Distance from downtown is quite far and a car or taxi takes just under 40 minutes early in the morning and possibly longer later in day with traffic. Huge selection of excellent cafes restaurants and souvenir stores. Also has small number of internet PC stations so you wont need a wi-fi enabled laptop to get online here. Helpful friendly staff.,4,0
denver-airport,Tori Wallace,United States,I fly in and out of Denver and it is one of the airports that you can figure your way around and also allows you to be able to find things you might have not expected. With the allowance to walk to terminal A and go through security there if you dont want to deal with the bigger security lines to keeping everything in check and also clean as can be it makes it such a nice place to travel through just wish the luggage would have been a little faster.,5,0
denver-airport,James Glass,United States,There are no hotels you can walk to from the terminal. Everything is located at maximum distance from everything else - rental cars accommodations and shopping. High speed rail to Union Station doesn't exist. If forced to stay overnight while changing planes vast amounts of time are involved getting to/from your hotel. I cannot conceive what the planners had in mind to create such an isolated ill-suited and tedious facility. Denver is a beautiful city but it is a distant glow from the terminal windows.,1,0
denver-airport,Ron Kuhlmann,United States,Transited twice in a week and found it to be a pleasant experience. Lots of folks but also lots of facilities for handling them. The space is comfortable and the layout is well able to deal with the volume. Nice place for a wait.,5,0
denver-airport,Matt Heinrich,,"I've flown into and out of Denver several times. Since we live overseas we always arrive at Denver after at least 30 hours of traveling and late at night. However Denver is one of a few airports that I land at after a long trip and do not feel like I'm cramped stressed or outdated. The terminals are very large and spacious and allow a large amount of natural light to illuminate the area. Even during the height of the holiday season when there are hoards of people flocking to Denver the airport gives the sense that it is never really crowded. Even the train system is rarely jammed with people. Despite that the problem that always seems to hit me is that my bag is always delayed or lost. After traveling for 30+ hours the last thing you want to do is wait for your bag or even worse be told that it will be delivered the following day. My suggestion is that Denver needs to find a real solution to their baggage problems. The ""new"" system has been a complete failure and United will no longer be using it because of maintenance costs.",4,0
denver-airport,D Hastings,,As a long term resident of the Denver metro area I appreciated the location of the previous Stapleton International Airport for passenger convenience (excellent bus connections for example) and layout (you could walk to any gate relatively quickly) but recognized the value of relocating and improving the runway situation for operations. DIA's downsides are its location vulnerability of passenger and crew access during snow or ice storms (which sometimes close the access road and regularly make it hazardous) security (Hint: there is a generally less used security post to Concourse A that I use even when flying from a different concourse - access over the direct access bridge past the changing art exhibit is very pleasant - then transfer to another concourse if needed) and lack of a walking or people- mover alternative to the trains in accessing Concourses B and C as is available in ATL for example. Somewhat better direct international connectivity would be nice. DIA's upsides are its architecture relative spaciousness airport art the very pleasant bridge and changing art exhibition space between the terminal and Concourse A (leading to that third less- utilized though smaller security checkpoint) runway design passenger-handling capacity (except for extreme travelling periods) and a couple of food and beverage outlets. The personal greeting by Denver's mayor as you arrive in the train at the terminal is a nice touch.,4,0
denver-airport,Brian Kahin,,A very nice airport in many respects. Internet access is poor. Abysmal free Internet service is erratic and won't permit sending SMTP email. They should allow pay services in addition. This is a big problem for business users and I haven't been able to find where to complain to. (Quest and then Skyport used to provide free LAN connections for business users but the space has been abandoned [Terminal B upstairs]. Nearest motels are 15 minutes away. The airport is supposedly the second largest (52 sq miles) but the amount of wasted space is truly extraordinary.,3,0
denver-airport,D Gardenier,,We had some time on a stopover and thought it might be nice to show our sin the terminal building which is a great and impressive building. To our surprise we had left the secure area simply by staying on the train to the terminal -- there is no indication that you have done so. We also felt that the scrutiny was severe. Liquids that were allowed through at our airport of origin were confiscated at Denver. We were lucky that the lines were not too long.,4,0
denver-airport,P McCorkle,,I've been through DIA many times and it's a pretty good airport. One of the best for the US. There are a lot of shops in and outside the secure area. Baggage is fast. Customs is fast. Security isn't always fast but it's never ungodly slow. Moving around the airport is pretty painless too. Personnel at ticket counters are professional and curteous. All the staff around the airport are generally pretty helpful. The only bad thing about DIA is that it's a hub for United. So if you go through DIA on an international flight or connecting to international you're probably stuck with United and that's no fun.,4,0
denver-airport,A Knuken,,I fly in and out of DIA regularly. For the most part it is quite a pleasant airport not terribly crowded pretty efficient. Long security lines are possible especially coming from places like Mexico City. Hold onto your bags! I put my baggage 10 feet in front of me and a porter took it from in front of my eyes. He thought they were someone else's bags. By the time I caught up with him he had loaded the bags into a limo which then drove away. I tried for weeks to get the baggage back (it contained my passport wallet $1000 in photo equipment warm jacket house keys laptop cell phone - everything you never want stolen) but nobody was able to help me get it back. There are some dishonest people milling about. Please be aware of that no matter how tired or safe you feel at DIA.,3,0
denver-airport,Ronald DePass,,Security goes fast and so does baggage claim. Excellent terminal for connections. I would use them again shame they dont have connections with Tocumen PTY Airport. The architecture looks beautiful.,5,0
denver-airport,Neil Ramsay,,Spent a total of 6 hours in UA's terminal during two separate transit stops. plenty to keep you occupied. shops are varied as are the food outlets. seating is plentiful rest rooms are clean gates are large enough to cope with full flights and departure info readily available throughout. staff are obliging. My airport of choice for transfers.,4,0
denver-airport,Emmet Ferwerda,,Been through this airport a few times over the last 5-10 years; it is an excellent facility in terms of architecture and service. I have had some problems with the security but I have not visited for 2-3 years so things may have changed. In all a very nice facility which I will gladly use again.,4,0
denver-airport,K Kapoor,,Check-in is generally quick and efficient. Security wait times can build up especially at the two main security check-points. Overall TSA staff courteous. The inter-terminal tram comes every three minutes. DIA has a huge variety of gift shops book stores restaurants and coffee houses though the restaurants do tend to be kind of generic. If you are planning on connecting from an international flight to a domestic flight I would recommend keeping at least a two-hour gap as customs in Denver can be a little slow but you should be able to get out in about an hour. Domestic arrival into Denver is easy as baggage generally comes quickly RTD skyride buses get you into the city for about $10. Thankfully due to the recent surge by Southwest DIA isn't dominated by United Airlines but flying out of Denver is still a little more expensive than other US airports. The architecture is stunning and the airport looks new despite being nearly 13 years old! The only negatives at this airport are the location the security lines and the alluring loneliness of the airport due to its large size.,4,0
denver-airport,S Srinivasan,,Main problems at DEN are security waits at peak hours (often 30 minutes or more since they funnel everybody through two checkpoints which are often understaffed) the large distances between terminals and the distance from the city itself. The positives are the relatively friendly staff good express bus service to the city center available right outside the terminal doors free WiFi in the terminals and ability to withstand winter weather (I've flown through three times during light/moderate snow and no problems with delays). I wouldn't want to try and make a connecting flight here especially if there's less than 90 minutes between flights but it's an OK airport if you're starting and ending your trip there.,3,0
denver-airport,Ronald DePass,,People are friendly and real. That's customer service! The facilities are great and customs is an easy thing to do. There's a lot of walk involved but that I can say it's not a negative point. I'd add closer places to eat at Terminal A. Other than that loved the experience and would enjoy visiting this airport again.,4,0
denver-airport,K Sexton,,This airport was clearly designed and built right before the security changes after 9/11. All the good restaurants are on the wrong side of security and therefore deserted while the small food stands in the concourses are over crowded. The wait/line at security is monumental and there needs to be an alternative to using the train to get to your concourse such as the pedestrian tunnel at Hartsfield. Forcing everyone onto the sardine can train is not fair. I realize airports are not something one would want to live next to but the location is crazy. Easily any hour's commute from south Denver combined with the rigors of the over-inflated airport itself can add hours to a trip that once in the air may be shorter than your wait at security.,1,0
denver-airport,D Brock,,"For its size a very good airport especially if transiting. A bit less if starting or ending there as security lines and baggage are a bit problematic. Security lines variable often quick sometimes maddeningly long and understaffed. They are making some progress: for example having people who will guide you across to the ""other"" screening if one is less crowded (DEN has two main screening lines with their entrances at the far ends of the very large main building so it is difficult to quickly decide which one to use. There is a third smaller screening across the bridge to Concourse A). Baggage claim can be a wait and seems to be getting worse. Baggage claim also seems needlessly cramped: for example all Frontier baggage is on three carousels (Frontier is Denver's 2nd largest carrier) so they are perpetually crowded (the signage often showing more than one page worth of flights coming on each carousel) when other carousels are empty.",3,0
denver-airport,Rohan Kapoor,,A functional airport. Check-in efficient and security waits generally less than 10 minutes. Concourse A is the closest and the walk across the bridge provides a stunning view of the airport. Most of the staff friendly. Customs/immigration process has been improved and I was out in less than 45 minutes after my flight from London Heathrow. Be prepared to walk a lot at Denver because the airport is so spread out - my guess is that you'll probably walked at least a mile by the time you reach your gate.,5,0
denver-airport,Charles Roberts,,I've been through Denver dozens of times and find it on the whole to be one of the best airports in the US. Despite its size it's easy to get around and I've found airport staff to always be helpful. As the airport grows in passenger volume I wish that they had more-frequent trains between terminals and that shuttle services could drop passengers off at check-in level but those are my only complaints about what is otherwise a good airport to use.,4,0
denver-airport,Pat Bates,,I use it fairly frequently and find it simple and spacious with stunning architecture to boot. Never have had a problem with long security wait lines - generally shorter than other major US airports. If you have to go to concourse B or C it is annoying to have to use the train and customs is sometimes woefully understaffed but aside from that I think Denver is one of the best airports in the US.,,0
denver-airport,Guy Senior,,Flew in and out a few days ago. International arrivals/immigration has been expanded since I last flew in but still took at least 40 minutes to get through. What was frustrating was that it then took about half an hour for bags to arrive so all in all well over an hour to get out and this from Concourse A which is the nearest and smallest. Flying out a different story. No queues at all at the BA check in and no more than 10 minutes delay at security and less than 5 minutes for the fingerprint test. Generally this is a clean and spacious airport - easy to get around and with splendid architecture.,,0
denver-airport,James Faulkner,,Flew into Denver during the second blizzard managed to land ok but waited 1hr 30 mins for luggage to arrive and had to catch a train to the luggage belts. Not a great first impression for an Australian and luckily an Indian man who lived in Denver showed me where to go otherwise I was lost. Used the airport 3 more times in the next 12 days and found it ok. Probably the best in the US but very average by world standards still. Some of the homeland security people were very nice and some very very rude. United check in staff uneducated and impossible to deal with and the police out the front were shocking! Then the car hire people didn't know the difference between a 4wd and a front wheel assist.,,0
denver-airport,Neil Ramsay,,Transited through Denver concourse B twice in 3 weeks. Always a pleasure to use this airport. Procedures ran smoothly and staff are always helpful. Plenty of places to pick up a quick snack a reasonable meal or a coffee. Gate change announcements are clear and departure/arrival info is readily available. Gate lounges are comfortable and spacious. Luckily I missed out on the blizzard induced 3 day shutdown.,,0
denver-airport,Rohan Kapoor,,I fly through DIA every few month and find the airport to be one the best in the country. No matter which airline you fly on the check-in is always fast and efficient. Security can be a bit of a pain as it takes a long time but everything else is ok. The automated train reaches the concourses quickly and all concourses have a nice selection of restaurants and book stores. Even the immigration process goes by quickly. Upon arrival from Frankfurt I was greeted by a friendly customs agent and retrived my baggage with in an hour of my arrival. The only problem with the airport is the long taxi times and the bumpy departures and arrivals. Overall DIA is a very modern and pleasant airport.,,0
denver-airport,Katherine Allen,,I fly frequently through DIA for work and to visit family. Arrivals and connections are painless (other than the 30 minute drive back to the city for arrivals) but Departures are awful. Security is combined for all three terminals and the lines are badly managed - expect to spend up to an extra two hours on very busy travel days or an hour on normal days waiting for security. Other than the security lines everything is fast efficient and friendly - even the food leaves nothing to complain about.,,0
denver-airport,Neil Ramsay,,Transited thru Denver three times in a few weeks. Always a pleasure to do so at this airport. Staff are friendly and efficient navigation and terminal transfer are easy flight info is readily available gate lounges are comfortable food concessions are acceptable and there is plenty to keep one occupied on a longer layover.,,0
derry-airport,Paul Devine,United Kingdom,Great Airport - used it for a Ryanair flight to Stansted. Small highly efficient - great bar restaurant and shops. A breeze to get through - am going to use again. Wish they were all like this.,10,1
derry-airport,Macrory Riley,United Kingdom,Fantastic airport brilliant staff took great care of my family when they were returning home and the baby travelling with them took ill. They couldn't of done enough getting medical help ringing emergency services getting flights rearranged with Ryanair free if charge. They also rang to see how the baby was on several occasions and when they were finally travelling home again the staff were yet again brilliant. You wouldn't get it in other airports.,10,1
derry-airport,Stuart Ward,United Kingdom,Small airport which has about 3 flights a day in and out. But it has everything you need bar coffee/snacks bar and 2 small shops selling snacks and another selling perfumes tourist items. Given the only flights are Ryanair the staff are lovely trying to help passengers on their journey. Check in was painless and quick. Security checks again quick but thorough. So if travelling to Londonderry/Derry I would recommend.,8,1
destin-ft-walton-beach-airport,E Slick,United States,This airport is very unprofessional. At 6 am I got in line to check my baggage in. There were 5 people in front of me and an inept crew behind the counter not helping anyone. There were two kiosks and one was out of order. The woman trying to use the only working kiosk took forever. After about 20 minutes one of the slack-jawed employees finally asked if he could help anyone. Well of course he could! 20 minutes ago. The impersonal level of the employees here was shocking and the airport was hot and stuffy.,,0
detroit-airport,Matt Temple,United States,For international departure DTW is ideal. For international arrivals DTW is to be avoided at all cost. The gross incompetence of TSA and US Customs at DTW amazes me. It took me almost two hours to slug through security and customs at DTW after arriving on time on a scheduled flight. DTW personnel (of which there are many but poorly trained) seemed taken by surprise by the arrival of my flight. TSA lines were needlessly long due to severe understaffing. DTW and TSA seem to have conspired to hire many employees to shout instructions to arriving passengers to cram into inadequate screening lines rather than to provide more screening lines. Avoid arriving at DTW from an international airport at all costs: TSA + DTW = totally inadequate to the point of utter incompetence. Delta and KLM: this is a major hub for your international operations. Why do you routinely subject your unfortunate customers to such mistreatment at DTW?,,0
detroit-airport,N Reddy,United States,This is a very convenient clean and well-designed airport. It works well both for international as well as domestic travel. There are numerous transportation options to and from the airport and the tram in the McNamara terminal is very convenient. Security is always very efficient yet thorough. I have been running late a number of times for flights our of Detroit Metro but the ease of parking the efficiency of security and the tram have always got me to the gate on time. Additionally there are numerous dining and shopping options for those who have time prior to take-off or those connecting to another city.,10,1
detroit-airport,S Koenig,Brazil,We arrived at and connected at the MacNamara terminal used by Delta etc. rather than the older north terminal used by Southwest American etc. which we had used on a previous trip. This terminal is relatively small clean and easy to use. We had a very short walk between gates. Almost disappointed we made our connection as I was secretly hoping we'd have to overnight and be put in the lovely Westin hotel that's in the terminal.,9,1
detroit-airport,C Hepworth,United Kingdom,I flew AMS-DWT and then on to MKE at the end of May it was a fair walk from the arrival gate to immigration passing the US citizen entry area which was quite full I only had 1 hour left of my transfer time left so was a little apprehensive as to how long the queue for non US persons what a surprise around ten booths open and around twenty people yes 20 people queuing! I was chatting to the CBP guy for 5 minutes since there was no one behind me it seems that immigration had been full at 2pm with flights from 'Asia' but is slow at 3pm for a while. I continued on past baggage claim (I only had hand luggage) and on to security screening again no queues. The staff were very friendly and we chatted about the difference between DTW and the madness at ORD and I was on to my next flight around 20 minutes from leaving the plane and half of that was chatting to officials. The elevators bring you out in departures at the central train stop so on to the train to the north station and the gate was around 2 minutes walk as usual I checked the gate and time I had time to freshen up and bought a Philly Steak which was very nice and around $5.00 soon after they were calling the flight. I have used the airport before without problems I have to give DTW 10 out of 10. A quick note you can take food and drink you buy in the terminal on to planes in the US most people seem to since they don't serve more then pretzels on board it is called buy and fly.,10,1
detroit-airport,C Barlow,United States,The Customs procedure leaves something to be desired. We will not book another flight that goes through Detroit for international flights again. We were on a flight that originated in Barcelona then onto Amsterdam (where we did a complete security scan) onto Detroit. We passed through customs just fine with the declarations paper completed and verified by an officer before we collected our luggage. Then our luggage was late coming off the plane and by then other flights arrived making the customs line exceedingly long. We told 3 customs officers patrolling the area (there were another 4 just standing around doing nothing) that we had a flight leaving in 30 minutes. Each one said we would make it. Then we had to go through another security check (we just had one at the gate in Amsterdam). Well we missed the flight. The next one we were put on was leaving 6 hours later and did not have the option of an extra 4 inches of leg room previously purchased for our original flight. In Amsterdam by the way there was an express line through customs for those travelers that had a flight leaving in 30 minutes or less. Why US airports don't do this should be explored. Probably because it makes sense.,2,0
detroit-airport,M Rosener,United Kingdom,Passed through on the way to Japan and was pleasantly surprised. I like this airport very much. Very clean excellent signage excellent dining options (pricey but good) video boards with the playoffs on the walls everything seems to run smoothly. Also had comfortable chairs which is nice.,10,1
detroit-airport,G Bradley,United Kingdom,Travelled here from Schiphol in transit to Orlando arriving at 4.20 pm on 10 October 2013. Shortest TSA lines we have experienced ever and the agent was both polite and welcoming which is unusual in our past experience. He apologised as the computer system froze and he had to reboot - as did his colleagues. Took around 10 minutes to get back on line and thereafter very efficient. Baggage recheck very quick and security well staffed and again very polite particularly when dealing with children and one passenger in a wheelchair. Overall Detroit is now our favourite transit airport.,9,1
detroit-airport,C Charlie,United States,What should have been a simple flight turned into a nightmare. Gate C24 boarded plane was told plane there was a problem had to de-plane and walk all the way over to Gate B18 and get on a second plane. Then told there was another fault had to wait 20 minutes for them to fix it after 20 minutes we had to again de-plane and walk back to the C24 Terminal. Now on third plane - waiting. To compensate they offered me a complimentary can of pop and pretzels. A lousy airline!,,0
detroit-airport,J Ludewig,Germany,Great stopover-airport to use for immigration. Immigration is always empty and within few minutes you are through the process. The airport itself is large but they have a train going thru the terminal which avoid long walks. Shops are ok. It is certainly a lot better than what you heard and read about the actual city of Detroit.,10,1
detroit-airport,S Miller,United States,This airport is very large and long. It is just one tunnel. There are 3 train stops throughout the McNamara Terminal. However there are constant announcements telling people the time in Japanese Spanish and English. I can't however rate the restrooms due to my non-entering. This airport is very large and spacious. There is never a contest for seats.,7,1
detroit-airport,M Shilkrut,United States,McNamara (Delta's) terminal. Very fast security (<5 min) very clean aesthetic and airy. Very helpful staff good places to get a snack or a good meal that range from common and affordable chains to exclusive restaurants. Love their VINO bar. There is a hotel inside the terminal and free internet for 30 min. Very rare delays. Very fast luggage delivery. Probably the best airport in the country and the best place for transit. Very limited public transportation. Plenty of parking - the closest one (2-10 min walk to the terminal) is expensive - 20$/day.,10,1
detroit-airport,M Mejia,Philippines,Probably the best US airport. Customs and immigration very efficient. Out of the customs queue in 30 minutes (including re checking bags for connecting flight from an international arrival). TSA not surly as in other US airports. Good facilities and eating options. Free wifi but limited to only 30 minutes. Would make this my transit point when visiting Eastern US.,9,1
detroit-airport,J Ludewig,Germany,Delta uses Detroit for international flights. Good for return flights to Germany when you do not need to go through customs. Stopover time was little less than one hour and no problem. Walking distances are fair and they have a train to make it faster to get from one side to the other. OK duty free and other retail options. A convenient hub to go through.,8,1
detroit-airport,R Marshall,United Kingdom,Choose Detroit as a gateway airport on my journey from the UK via Amsterdam to Phoenix. Reviews promised reasonable TSA and a comfortable terminal with a train inside it. These promises were kept! The a/c docked at 2.23pm. At 3.23 I took a seat by the gate for my connecting flight. I'd allowed 2.5 hours for transfer and I did it 1 hour. Immigration were helpful - there were few US nationals and lots of internationals so they processed the US nationals in the US only area and then opened it up to non USA passport holders. Sensible. Flexible. Customs were fine. Next help was on hand to ensure transferring passengers sent their checked baggage to the right place. TSA processed us fairly and efficiently and before we knew it we were out in the terminal. There are 2 trains which shuttle back and forth incessantly so it's a quick way to the far end gates. Terminal staff seemed happy and helpful - even ground crew were getting merrily on with the work. The place had a very relaxed atmosphere though it was early afternoon with few flights. All in all it was a very good experience. I'd recommend Detroit as an easy entry to the US.,10,1
detroit-airport,E Biafore,United States,DTW is my home airport so I may be a little bias. Flew out of Delta terminal and it is still a world class terminal compared to other airports. Great restaurants and a lot of shopping to pass the time.,10,1
detroit-airport,R Maccuswell,United States,Flew in here for a transfer for the first time. It is probably one of the nicest major airports in the US. Well laid out lots of restaurant options tram to get from one end to the other of a very long terminal. All gate staff very nice. Cannot speak of terminal side stuff as only there for a transfer but for my next international trip would not hesitate to fly in and out of here.,9,1
detroit-airport,Martin Reynolds,United Kingdom,Using this airport has always been our preference for entry into the US. Recently the care and support we received from so many employees at the airport along with officials has been outstanding. My in-laws traveled there recently with our son who has learning difficulties and they made every effort to make his passage through the facility as stress free as possible. At other airports help has been offered grudgingly and resentfully - here at Detroit Wayne it was offered professionally and effectively.,10,1
detroit-airport,S Hedden,United States,Nice clean efficient airport. I arrived during a snowstorm with active blowing snow and 5 degree weather. The airport didn't miss a beat with a fleet of ploughs keeping the runways clear and no apparent delays due to the weather. Nice tall ceilings and lots of windows give the airport a nice open feel. Moving sidewalks and transit train make quick time of getting from gate to gate.,9,1
detroit-airport,Paul Townsend,United States,It has been vastly improved since 2002 with its complete rebuild featuring the two new terminals. The McNamara terminal used by Delta and its SkyTeam partners continues to impress me since I wrote my previous review in 2006 (below). The distances in the overlong A concourse are covered effortlessly by the tram system and even the long walk to the end of the B and C concourses feature moving walkways along their entire distance. The best architectural feature is the light show tunnel connecting the B and C concourses with the main complex. The new North Terminal extends this welcoming atmosphere to the non-SkyTeam airlines that use the airport. With the exception of one overly rude person the employees have all treated me well here too and the amenities at both terminals are exemplary. Gone are the days of the old terminal system with their horrible congestion and decrepit upkeep. With Detroit's urban decay they might look to the airport for ideas on how to improve things elsewhere in the metropolitan area.,9,1
detroit-airport,D Wright,United States,A great place to change planes as food and other services are noticeably better than most US airports. The corridors are very long but moving sidewalks and a tram make this manageable. Sky Clubs in the Delta terminal are noticeably better than those in ATL and most other airports - less crowded with very comfortable furnishings and sense of space and quiet.,8,1
detroit-airport,E Edmonds,United Kingdom,DTW remains perhaps my favourite airport. I have used Terminal 3 times and encountered courtesy and friendliness from check in and security staff. Shopping facilities are fine Huge concourses but easy to find your way around and lots of seating. I have never had to change flights here so cannot comment on that and my only note of dissent would be the amount of time that it takes to get through incoming security. There never seems to be enough people on the gates.,7,0
detroit-airport,S Koenig,Brazil,The McNamara (South) terminal looked clean and modern and easy to traverse for passengers. However we arrived at and a few days later departed from the North Terminal. The terminal itself is clean and un-crowded but once we got our bags we had to take them up one level then cross a pedestrian bridge over the airport road then down to a lower level go outside and find the appropriate shuttle bus. Rental car facilities are some distance from either terminal. You have to go to the lower parking structure level of either terminal and then take a rather long convoluted trip to the facility. On the plus side I have no fault with the cleanliness of either terminal. Eating facilities were decent. TSA personnel at the North Terminal seemed brusque but that can obviously vary from shift to shift.,4,0
detroit-airport,E Mabley,United States,DTW's south terminals (Delta and affiliates) are well-designed and functional with better than average food and beverage options. Ideal for connections but not so much for O&D traffic as there are long walks/rides to the bag claim and rental car facilities.,4,0
detroit-airport,Michael Davies,United Kingdom,Arrived from Dulles on Delta. A reasonable walk under the tunnel to the reclaim area. Bags arrived in good time and a short walk to the car park. I was out of the airport 30 mins after landing. Departure to Baltimore from McNamara Terminal. Checked in using self service machines easy to use. Bag drop quick and efficient many desks open so no queue. Security efficient. Walked to our gate but you could take the fast train a good food court and bar near gates A70.,5,0
detroit-airport,S DePenning,United States,DTW is a very nice clean and modern airport with a straightforward layout that is easy to navigate. For all of the bad economic news coming out of Detroit you would never think it from seeing the beautiful airport the city has.,5,0
detroit-airport,M Lane,Hong Kong,Clean bright tall ceilings lots of windows. The ratio of seats to passengers is good. Same goes for bathrooms which are also clean. The McNamara terminal is one long line with repetitive stations where you can find flight monitors bathrooms ATMs and restaurants. It has even numbered gates on one side odd on the other. The bad : customs agents are not the nicest regional ground employees are stretched too thin.,5,0
detroit-airport,Christian Johnson,Hong Kong,This has become my favorite transfer point if I'm headed anywhere in the eastern US other than New York. DTW is just about the only US airport that strikes me as first world. It's intelligently designed with an internal metro system running the length of the main McNamara terminal and moving underground walkways to connect to the parallel B/C terminal. It's long and big but that's the nature of airports and the transit systems are easy to use and obvious. Food options are pretty decent too with a few choices that rise above the usual food court fare. Immigration and customs are about as painless as is reasonable to hope for given asinine TSA practices that reflect absurdly unrealistic US passenger expectations for security.,5,0
detroit-airport,G McGowan,United States,Delta terminal is excellent for making connections. Yes it is long--1 mile long to be exact-- but it's great for exercising when you have a long layover. There are also moving walkways and an indoor monorail that run the length of the A concourse. The A concourse and the B and C concourses are connected by a psychedelic light & sound tunnel. Don't rush if you don't have to-take it all in! Facilities terminal-wide are excellent with the best dining options in the A concourse although if you like burgers there is a Fuddrucker's in the C concourse.,5,0
detroit-airport,J Ludewig,Germany,My first connection flight thru Detroit. I sat business from Frankfurt so I was early off the plane to immigration. That part was handled virtually in 5 minutes. Very empty friendly staff - have seen that different in other US hubs. We had a delay ex Frankfurt I still managed my connection within less than 30 minutes between both flights. The facilities seemed to be ok. I had hardly any time to look around. Looks like an airport you can stand a layover.,5,0
detroit-airport,M Setiramm,,Nice and clean but whoever came up with the stupid parallel and long terminal design clearly lacked imagination and must have been a runner. I don't know why they thought having only 1 connecting tunnel between terminals was a good idea and then made the main terminal super long but I think it could have been better designed. Never had a chance to check out the retail since I am too busy trying to make the connection. All I can say is that if you are connecting from a large jet to a regional flight have at least 45-60 mins between connections.,4,0
detroit-airport,Cristiano Miro,,I connected for the first time in DTW with NWA. As previously mentioned the McNamara terminal is indeed VERY long. However it does have moving-steps and alas: its own metro system (with red trams like NWA's planes) - with tram stops along the way. Also the terminal is immaculately kept with a clean decor and floor to ceiling windows throughout. Add a wide array of dining and shopping options and you've got an award-winning product. Definitely better than ATL and even better than the pleasant Delta terminal in CVG.,4,0
detroit-airport,Nathanael Lim,,Detroit Airport is one of the most interesting airports. Uniquely long stretch from one end to the other very clean facilities good dining and interesting duty-free shops. I loved the fact that the airport has a tram that travels very quickly from one end to the other at the top corner of the building. However security staff are not friendly especially the immigration sector when travelling in and out of Detroit to Tokyo.,4,0
detroit-airport,L Hirschel,,Detroit Metro Airport (DTW) has good bus connection via Michigan Flyer serving East Lansing Ann Arbor and Jackson MI were it not for the fact that Metro Airport management refuses to allow signing of the bus stop location at the terminal The Landside Director insists that signage must be restricted to concessionaires (taxi companies). The Michigan Flyer was forced to remove a diagram showing the bus stop location from its own website. Also the airport authority removed all written material regarding the Michigan Flyer service and bus stops from the traveler's aid desk. As a senior arriving after a 24 hour international journey I was unable to find any airport personnel who could direct me to the bus stop. Exhausted and loaded with my luggage I took a bad fall in my hurried attempt to find the bus stop. Finally a police officer directing parking traffic gave me directions. Although I should have had ample time had I known where to go I barely made the lengthy distance to the unmarked bus stop in time. This lack of proper signage is totally unacceptable and contrary to public interest and safety.,2,0
detroit-airport,K Shu,,DTW is the best airport I have visited. Have not experienced much delay in all the years that I have used it. Baggage claim was good. McNamara Terminal interior (I have used NW much) was excellent. Though the terminal is freakishly long (one mile) the walkways help ease walking. Customs was excellent (perhaps due to the fact that I am a US citizen). Oddly enough I have never used Dulles for international. My only complaint is that the security areas are compact and check-in can sometimes be inefficient.,5,0
detroit-airport,D King,,I have travelled through Detroit on several occasions. McNamara terminal is very neat courteous security and check in airline staff. Lots of shops and things to do before your flight. The new North terminal is a big improvement from the old terminals! The security isn't as precise as I imagined but they were very friendly and cracking jokes. The only complaint I have is I purchased a new expensive set of luggage only for it to come out with several tar footprints on it! My luggage has been destroyed in a sense I flew through Detroit just a couple weeks ago and it has more footprints on it! Well at least it got there! I will fly through Detroit again in the future!,4,0
detroit-airport,Nupur Chaddha,,The immigration officials were a bit incompetent. Mostly due to lack of familiarity with computers. Airport facilities are fine and I had flown before through the airport. But immigration and customs are not like other US airports. I would avoid it if this is your port of entry because of this. Otherwise domestically it is fine.,2,0
detroit-airport,Greg White,,Arrival at McNamara Terminal from London on NWA was smooth and efficient. Uncharacteristically Immigration Officers were polite! Baggage was delivered promptly and transfer to onward NWA domestic flight was painless. A sports bar at the airport provides a haven for smokers! All in all an excellent experience.,5,0
detroit-airport,P Keyser,,Nice airport easy directions. I arrived and departed at the Edward H. McNamara Terminal. Terminal was very clean and you found everything to eat or a quite area to read. Nice is the as well the Tram that you brings you easily from one end to the other. At Security you was asked in a very friendly why you are leaving and it was a smooth way from check in to the gate.,4,0
detroit-airport,Brian Wilson,,I found Detroit airport to be an easy airport to get around in. I arrived at the Smith Terminal and found the check in at American Airlines very quick and easy. I saw the line for security and thought it would take forever but moved along quite quickly and left me with about two hours to go before my flight. There were limited amount of places to eat Quiznos was every where and not much else. You could get a beer for an inflated price.,4,0
detroit-airport,R Gray,,I have transited the DTW airport numerous times and found that it is a great facility. I arrived at gate 78 and my departure gate was gate 6 with 15 minutes to make the flight. Jumping on the tram made this easy and doable. Once you understand (it is easy) how to use the tram you can be in any part of Terminal A within minutes. If you have time there are a variety of place to eat that can fit any budget and many places to shop. There is an intriguing water/fountain feature in the middle of terminal where its fun just to people watch. The facility is clean with lots of bathrooms and really easy to get around.,4,0
detroit-airport,R Heelas,,For BA passengers the new terminal is a vast improvement from the old terminal BA used (1 food outlet /1 shop (always closed). On arriving the immigration/customs queues were quite long and slow must have waited 30-40 minutes. Checkin and security flying out was painless. The terminal design is not for everyone a narrow mile long structure with gates on each side. Plus Points; Lots of space and seating plenty of eating places easy to navigate and very clean. Negative points: The choice of eating places depends on where you are. If you want to see whats on offer at each place you need to spend time and walk a lot. Shopping is quite limited. All in all a very good airport,4,0
detroit-airport,Paul Townsend,,Having used both the McNamara and Smith terminals I find it safe to say that Detroit Metro is almost two different airports in terms of quality. The new McNamara terminal used by Northwest and its SkyTeam partners is a monumental improvement in terms of quality over that awful old Davey Terminal. Some distances can be long but unlike many airports of this size there are moving walkways (and the A concourse tram) the entire distance to your gate. The architecture though not entirely cutting-edge is very light and welcoming and the center mall area contains a wealth of dining and shopping. The Smith terminal (which serves all non-SkyTeam domestic airlines) on the north side of the airport is uncrowded but astonishingly dilapidated and depressing as some reviewers mention below. The new north terminal that is now being built will be a welcome relief from this antiquated and obsolete relic.,,0
detroit-airport,L Thiry,,A great airport - clean modern well organized. The dining and shopping choices are excellent and I really don't mind having to spend a few hours in this airport. It's quite comfortable. Clearing customs is always fairly quick and efficient and the people who work at this airport tend to be very friendly and helpful. Even though I am not from Detroit when arriving at this airport from abroad I already feel home.,,0
detroit-airport,Andrew Strodtman,,As a resident of the Detroit Metro area I have to say that the new terminal is definitely an improvement over the old one. Definitely get to this airport early - traffic can be horrible in the area and you'll want the extra time to clear the security. But once you get through the checkpoints the MacNamara terminal offers many opportunities to relax and enjoy yourself before your flight. You can catch a beer and a game (and a smoke if you so desire) in one of the bars peruse the various shops around the terminal or simply read a book or magazine that you can purchase from many different kiosks if you didn't bring one with you already. Generally very clean spacious-feeling and easy on the eye.,,0
detroit-airport,Viktorie Kafka,,I was pleasantly surprised by DTW. The terminal is modern design is attractive food and shopping provide great selection and the staff no matter if airport or other is usually very friendly (not common at US airports according to my experience) - plus good news for smokers there is legal spot for smoking Fox Sport Bar right across the Sky lounge. Even the immigration process and customs are smooth and quick without pointless hassling and abusing the power of uniform. I admit the terminal is very long and narrow and can get crowded easily and the inside terminal tram can be confusing for first time visitors but the atmosphere and facilities are good and definitely beats majority of the US airports.,,0
detroit-airport,A Krishnan,,"I booked a ticket from Atlanta to Amsterdam via DTW on Northwest Airlines. After hearing the rave reviews about the new WorldGateway I had high expectations for it. However as soon as I stepped out of the gate I realized I had been let down. There are only three tram stations in the entire mile-long terminal so some walking is needed. It is easy to walk such distance in a normal scenario but toting a carryon bag does not help. Also senior citizens who have some difficulty walking will find the airport to be miserable for the same reason. The terminal is actually quite narrow so crowds cannot disperse too easily. If a family of eight or nine stops to look at an airport map a bottleneck will ensue as two or three people at a time try to make their way around the family. Besides the walking and crowds the choice of dining is minimal- besides the normal fast food chains and two or three restaurants there isn't too much more to expect. I found that my packed peanut butter sandwich was better than what most stores offered. After returning from Amsterdam I was faced with perhaps the rudest customs agents I have encountered. The agents barked orders to people who hardly knew English and made no efforts to explain things to them. In every other city I have cleared customs I've been greeted with a pleasant ""welcome home!"". Not this time. The man behind the counter grumpily stamped my passport and bade me farewell. Detroit's new terminal isn't all it's made out to be and I will make a point to avoid it in the future.",,0
detroit-airport,Wendy Tien,,I've flown (international flights only) in and out of DTW several times since the new NW terminal opened and I can't believe what a massive improvement it's been. The food and shopping are great and the NW Worldclubs are really really nice. But coming in from London once our NW flight was prohibited from deplaning until all the passengers from a previous flight had cleared passport control. We had to stay on the plane at the gate an additional 50 minutes after landing and most of us missed our connections. The explanation the airport provided was that there was some rule permitting only one flight to clear passport control at a time - something I have never heard of at any other airport - and we were encouraged to write to the local legislators to complain. It was an utterly bizarre experience and one I still don't understand.,,0
detroit-airport,Nick Pierce,,I've flown home several times from Montreal to my hometown Chicago on NW for the holidays good connections at the McNamara Terminal and impressive duty-free on the way back to Montreal. Just a tip for smokers as of January 2005 smokers could still enjoy a cigarette in the Fox Skybox Lounge located in the middle of the terminal near the duty-free shop. Used to airports like O'Hare and Montreal's Dorval which relegate smokers to the curb (more complicated in Montreal because you have to exit through US customs again to get back out!) this was a welcome surprise.,,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Robert Walbeek,China,"Everything is slow in this airport with lots of mosquito's. Toilets filthy and the attendant is not shy to ask for a tip. Security on departure is non-existent. Broken down x-rays machines, not working displays with gate information. Luggage on arrival takes ages, so does immigration. Everything with pen and paper, no computers? All the duty free shops sell the same things at the same prices. ",5,0
dhaka-zia-airport,M Bertram,Australia,"It is like a tale of two airports - departure was a breeze (though there was some confusion about whether we needed to pay the new departure tax) with a quick check in and quick immigration, while arriving was the usual chaotic scrum. Immigration took about 30 minutes though there wasn't really a queue to speak of. Upon leaving we did find a desk offering reasonably priced transfers (with a little bargaining of course). I was surprised to see some nice new toilets in the departure area though the airport still lacks a good array of eateries (and the shops all sell basically the same things). There is also a lack of places to sit once are in the departure area (except at the gates after the security check).",5,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Robert Walbeek,China,Was in Dhaka again a few days ago. Arrival procedures slow again very slow it takes ages to get your luggage. Immigration is from the 50's paper and paper work as others say here: mosquitos are the real hassle in the airport this time the toilets at immigration were available. Departure: there was a cricket match going on on TV meaning all staff in shops restaurants and security were more interested in the game then serving you.,5,1
dhaka-zia-airport,Robert Walbeek,China,"Bangladesh is chaos so is the airport. Upon arrival had to wait more than 1 hour before I saw my bag on the belt. Immigration reasonably fast but be aware no toilets there. Upon departure a few days later security had to be bribed as they saw a bottle of wine in my bag which ""was not allowed"". At the gate security non-existent x-ray machine broken down people scanner broken down and then there is a guy in plain clothes padding your jacket that is what you call security? Duty free shops there are at least 6 of them all selling the same stuff. Toilets adequate and yes there are 2 smoking rooms.",,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Shane Walker,Bangladesh,Having lived in Dhaka for almost 3 years during which time I have travelled through both the Dhaka domestic and international terminals more times than I can remember. During my time in Dhaka there have been some very minor improvements although none that I have seen in the domestic terminal. E.g. there is now a decent barista coffee shop and a few new duty free shops (although a number of them sell nothing except chocolate and cosmetics - no alcohol) in the departure lounge. However overall the Dhaka airport still ranks as one of the worst anywhere in the world. It is extremely dirty bathroom facilities are disgusting staff are rude and generally unhelpful immigration is a joke (locals are allowed to queue anywhere including in the lanes marked Foreign Passport and VIP only) check-in is terrible again people can que anywhere (business or economy). The place is full of dengue carrying mosquito. The only minor saving grace is the AMEX business lounge which is relatively clean but the food is pretty bad and you get 1 only complimentary drink after which they are expensive.,,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Z Adam,United Kingdom,I think Dhaka international airport lounge is quite decent clean and has been improving. Ok its not Dubai standard but better than many international airports in the region like India. The free wifi is the best I have seen so far in comparison to other airports I have used. The coffee in the small cafe is quite good and not over priced. If you are buying chocolate the prices are reasonable. The seats could be improved.,7,1
dhaka-zia-airport,D Stanley,United Kingdom,I have travelled through Dhaka international airport quite a few times in the last five years. I am not sure why people say it is improving as it is not. It stays exactly the same just like anything else government run in the country. All government institutions have an absolute aversion to any sort of change. There are a few less mosquitoes in the baggage claim area that is the only positive thing I can say. Immigration on arrival means long and slow moving queues. The Ruposhi Bangla business lounge is poor with limited seating and similarly limited range of snacks and drinks. The wifi did not work on my way out. The City Bank Amex lounge looks better so getting a card if you are a regular visitor could be worthwhile. They also have the only lounge in the domestic terminal. The domestic terminal has improved a bit over the last few years. The departure lounge is clean and the air conditioning working.,3,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Khalilur Rahman,South Africa,I often visit Bangladesh every time I go I see improvements. Airport staff are friendly immigration services are just cool duty free shop's are also okay. The whole airport is quite clean. Custom services are also good if you have declared correctly then it's smooth. One thing they need to have are public phones on site.,9,1
dhaka-zia-airport,R Jones,Bangladesh,"I have been through DAC a few times the past months and it has much improved. Immigration especially on departure is efficient and waiting times down to minutes in the foreigners lines. Visas on arrival now issued for many nationalities and becoming popular. When leaving it is worthwhile entering the departures from door 6 at the far end given its much quieter and ""reserved"" for visiting businessmen etc. Not much to do in the departures lounge and food and drink facilities limited. But it certainly works well these days and with a few cosmetic changes and improved airside refreshment then DAC will be well on its way.",5,1
dhaka-zia-airport,M Sadek,United States,They have separate immigration counters for foreign passport holders but no one cares. Anticipate a long wait. Over all - chaos. Be careful with your luggage.,4,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Indranil Chakrabarty,Australia,Thousands of money changers and touts and assorted hanger ons. Can be a confronting sight. BA flight was smooth. Immigration queues long. As soon as you are out of the arrivals area a bunch of touts will pounce upon you with offers of cheap taxis good exchange rates hotels the works. Do not transit through this airport. If you are travelling to Bangladesh then of course you don't have much of a choice. Give yourself plenty of time when departing. Take a print out of your e-ticket.,5,0
dhaka-zia-airport,M Bertram,Australia,Well our arrival into DAC was terrible with long queues at the immigration desks and baggage that seemed to take forever to appear. However our departure from DAC was so smooth. Check in was straightforward and there was no line at the foreigners immigration desk. There isn't much to do at the airport aside from a few shops but when we were there (mid morning) it was fairly quiet so we walked up and down the length of the airport past all of the gates and watched the cargo planes being loaded up. The toilets there are ok.,6,1
dhaka-zia-airport,G Chew,United Kingdom,On my last trip through DAC things went fairly well. No queue to check in for Jet Airways and no one else in the foreigners immigration queue. Airside is fairly boring but there is a reasonable restaurant as well as two duty free shops. Baggage reclaim on arrival took a long time (arriving on Malaysia Airlines) but getting a Visa on Arrival was very quick and easy. The domestic terminal is small and fairly efficient. There is very little to do in the terminal but check in only opens 1 hours before departure so this shouldn't be a problem. Staff in both terminals seemed friendly and toilet facilities were bearable.,7,1
dhaka-zia-airport,M Maleque,Bangladesh,Every time I visit the airport I have to face really long queues both before departure and after landing. The airport is not at all clean and there isn't much to do at the airport. The airport staff aren't very friendly or helpful. The worst part is collecting your luggage. I had to wait for over an hour at times around the luggage belts to collect my bags (I usually travel with 1 or 2 bags). But the Wi-Fi connection is quite good actually.,4,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Rob Brook,United Kingdom,Update to my review dated June 2009. Used the airport again in January 2012. Immigration was fine not excessive waiting. But avoid arrival on a large aircraft (in our case an Emirates B777). On Emirates everyone is given a 30 kg baggage allowance and uses it to maximum effect to import consumer items from the Middle East (e.g. giant TV screens). That combined with a totally inadequate baggage handling system led to a two hour wait for our bags - not an ideal welcome after long flights from UK. Basically everything ceased up because not enough people were removing what bags had arrived to clear spaces for more to be loaded on to the single belt in use. Departure was thankfully less fraught due to early arrival so queues were avoided. But the free computer terminals for the Internet have been removed and there is no wi-fi. Be warned if you haven't spent all your Taka changing money back to US$ (no other currency apparently available despite having tills full of a whole range of currencies) is not easy. The kiosk in the departure area beyond Immigration is rarely staffed but there is another downstairs back through Immigration which they cheerfully waved us through and back again(!) where they grudgingly allowed to exchange back to hard currency. They insist on seeing the initial exchange receipt from when we changed money upon arrival so hang on to it and plan your spending to avoid the hassle!,5,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Ashraf Hoque,Bangladesh,Dhaka airport is quite busy not that clean but okay. Duty free is expensive while not up to the mark. Toilet facilities should be much improved. Immigration on departure - queuing time is high in rush hours. They couldn't even recognize my e-Boarding pass and I had to wait until a supervisor came over. On the announcement of boarding native people were running to board as if someone else would take away their seats! On arrival immigration service is faster luggage takes some times to arrive taxi service is poor and not trustworthy. Despite lot of issues food in the duty free area restaurants is quite good also the food in the business class lounge is nice.,5,1
dhaka-zia-airport,R Ali,Bangladesh,Small and peaceful airport. The queues can be long at times but from starting my journey from my home to immigration was completed in 30 minutes! Adequate seating airside. Washrooms okay (except near the luggage belt - horrible). Duty free and restaurants - expensive and best to avoid.,7,1
dhaka-zia-airport,Michael Barry,United Kingdom,I frequently travel to Dhaka from the UK. I find that from leaving the plane and going for my luggage is absolutely professional. The immigration at Dhaka are very good and pleasant. Customs do their job the only issue is that the luggage does take a while. The Bangladeshis will go out their way to help you. All staff at the airport are helpful. On the outward journey the only issue is if you need to contact anyone lack of phone booths at a reasonable price. All in all I would give it 4 out of 5. Very good I've been to worse. Turkey Spain Ireland and Greece to name but a few are a lot worse than Dhaka.,4,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Henrik Gustafsson,Bangladesh,"Not customer friendly airport at all although some improvements made lately i e new shops and cleaner toilets. Departure is mostly fine go to the Sheraton lounge at the third floor and enjoy a cold beer while waiting for departure. Arriving though is horrible expect long queues to passport control and anywhere between 2-3 hours for the luggage to arrive. Arrange someone to pick you up since ""taxis"" are unreliable.",2,0
dhaka-zia-airport,I Chowdhury,,This is by a long way the worst airport I have been in. On entering it is utter chaos with touts sprinting behind your car so as to grab your luggage when you stop. It takes a raised voice to get them to go away usually. Some even pretend to be from your airline and say it is part of the service. They will then demand money when they have taken your bags in. The security is pretty woeful. The very old scanning machine is manned by totally disinterested looking staff who to be frank do not look like they know what they are looking for. It is also quite easy to walk around the metal detector when staff are not looking. Check in is ok. But there is a complete lack of information if your flight is delayed. Immigration is quite a slow process as often there machines break down and details have to be hand written. The shops and restaurant facilities are absolutely miserable. The duty free guys will try to rip you off especially if you try to pay Taka and not USD. The Sheraton bar upstairs is a bit more peaceful but hardly fantastic. Boarding the flight is chaos. As soon as there is a hint that boarding may begin there is a stampede to get to the front of the queue. I feel like reminding people that seats are allocated by ticket this is not a Dhaka bus! Arriving I feel is even worse. The immigration officers are slow. There is no machine readable passport system so everything is written down at a glacial speed. Friends who have asked for visa on arrival have been taken away to interview rooms and a bribe has been directly demanded. The luggage wait can be beyond belief. I have waited for well over an hour on occasions with no explanation of where the cases have been. Cases are also routinely tampered with. And as for exiting the airport and looking for a taxi- scary!,1,0
dhaka-zia-airport,S Bashar,,"Just traveled in and out of Zia International Airport on international trip. It has improved since my last visit 4+ years ago. There's a ""health desk"" at the arrivals hall manned by health professionals but does not seem to serve any purpose; no one at the immigration desks that follow ask about the form. Although there are separate immigration counters for Bangladesh Passport Holders Non-Resident Bangladeshis nationals of other South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and Foreigners in effect there are only two gateways: foreign passport holders and Bangladesh passport holders. The arrivals hall is all very civilized but the time it takes for the luggage carousels to start delivering checked luggage varies: it's quicker for day-time arrivals and dreadfully slow during the post mid- night hours. Departure check-in varies airline to airline; it's a lot quicker if you checked in online via the web. Departure immigration is no non-sense friendly and professional. There are two smoking rooms at either ends of the terminal on the air-side on the departure level. There are a few duty free shops selling both Bangladeshi export quality products such as leather bags cases shoes etc. as well as stores selling run of the mill duty free stuff (cigarettes perfumes). There are not many public phone booths that are working as most people use cellphones. Not the most interesting place on the face of the earth but there are worse places to be stuck in that part of the world.",3,0
dhaka-zia-airport,R Brook,,Arrival - immigration reasonably efficient with average queuing time (10 - 15 minutes for an Airbus 330 load). Baggage return slow - about 30 minutes. Taxi area outside the terminal is chaotic; lots of taxi touts. They need to sort that out. Thankfully we were being met. Departure is good. Drop off is no problem. X-ray screening of all bags is done upon entry to the terminal and hand baggage again at the gate. I can imagine huge queues at peak time but we avoided that. We were early for our Qatar Airways check in so did not experience any queues. Once through Immigration (very quick no waiting) there is free internet (4 terminals 30 minutes limit) and up the stairs there's a small cafe with reasonably priced (by airport standards) food (limited range Bangladeshi food only) if you don't mind the sales pitch to buy local confections! We paid in Taka so no idea if they take foreign currency. Duty free shops are cheap & OK and accept foreign currency. Seating is adequate. There isn't much else to do so bring a good book. The terminal including the toilets is clean. We were there on what looked like quiet days so can't advise on what it's like at peak times. Overall rather better than I expected,3,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Dave Stanley,,No problems with immigration or baggage delivery now. There is quite a good selection of shops/cafes in the departures area. If you are leaving on a large aircraft (Emirates) there are not enough seats in the gate area. So it is best to go to the gate early or late. There are some problems with mosquitoes in the airport so it is best to wear long sleeved shirts.,4,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Akther Miah,,I have recently returned from Bangladesh to the UK and I think that overall Zia International has improved over the years but the actual facilities are still very limited in regard's to meeting the modern air travel standards. I think there should be more impetus on staff training and both in the smooth handling of the passengers and the overall customer service element. The shops and restaurants in the airport itself does not reflect the current trends in the modern Dhaka Metropolis as this is a shame as Zia International is used by many tourist on route to other destinations where the impact of the Airport can be used to market Bangladesh effectively.,2,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Mark Bickerton,,A few tips for Dhaka ZIA. If departing there is a nice cafe on the first floor that few people know about. Alternatively sit away from the gates near to passport control- there are lots of seats there and its quiet. On arriving if you need transport walk away from the terminal and jump into an auto rickshaw/baby taxi or get a taxi from the roundabout just outside the airport. I like this airport- people are friendly many other passengers are curious about foreigners and things seem to work well here,3,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Shafqat Akanda,,ZIA has improved - much bigger and cleaner now including the restrooms. The effective space of the airport has doubled. Immigration customs check-in lobby everything is much more spacious. Immigration officers are still learning their software but they are courteous. The main trouble point is still the arrival curb and the taxi area. That place is still chaos and needs to be straightened out. Those who have cars waiting should not have any problem - but others will be at the mercy of the swindlers. Overall the airport has come a long way - luggage unloading was really quick took us less than 20 minutes to get out of the airport. The airport could use some restaurants and shops though.,4,0
dhaka-zia-airport,A Haque,,Dhaka s getting better. Passport control is a bit slow. Only a few shops and at arrival the duty free is very low stocks and doesn't take any credit cards. Baggage claim need to be improve and faster. A Taxi cab booth needs to be opened inside the terminal building so people don't get hassled by the cab drivers and middle men. Custom checks should be quicker and liberal for the long journey passengers. All other things are nice - friendly staff clean secured and quiet.,4,0
dhaka-zia-airport,M Rashid,,Departure from Dhaka airport is much better than the arrival. However the arrival also on the side of OK. The main problem in arrival is to get a transport after exiting the terminal. Full of taxi agents and chaos. After renovation it is nice clean modern and most importantly very spacious. Although the airside facilities are limited only into a small duty free shops and couple of restaurants its ok these days as you dont have to wait a long time as there is almost no transit passenger.,3,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Mark Bickerton,,Check-in is usually a bit busy but everyone is polite and it works OK. Immigration queues are longer for Bangladeshis than foreigners as there are generally many more Bangladeshis. Once through there is a lovely Sheraton cafe on the first floor which everyone can access but its always very quiet and relaxing compared to the pretty tacky cafe on the ground floor. No real shops to speak of but to be honest thats a refreshing change these days. Arrivals - if you are at the back of the plane the queue at immigration will be long by the time you get there. If flying to Dhaka try to get a seat near the front of economy so you can get to the immigration before the crowds. Everyone is very friendly and the hall is spacious. Baggage is sometimes slow and exiting the airport can be a bit daunting.,3,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Dave Stanley,,I found the airport to be reasonable. Immigration was a bit slow on the way in. No other problems though. On the way out there are a limited number of shops/restaurants. The airport is quite modern and clean. Even the toilets are OK. The domestic terminal is quite small but again not too bad.,3,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Riaz Osmani,,Departure facilities are excellent. Ground staff of the airline you are flying will largely determine your experience. They are usually quite good in Dhaka. Arrival facilities are a mixed bag. Immigration signs are large and clear upon disembarking your aircraft. Passport Control slow but functioning. Nothing to worry about. Baggage handling a bit messy. Conveyor belts are on two sides of passport control. I went back and forth between the two since they kept changing their minds about where to dump our luggage. Eventually they settled on one belt. Note: Bags can arrive on a belt adjacent to the one they mentioned on the board. Also the new conveyor belts are a little narrow meaning your suitcases have a hard time staying on them. Look around a bit if you cannot find your bags. If you are arriving from Europe or North America you may be asked to jump the queue and exit the terminal ahead of those arriving from the Middle East who are subject to rigorous customs checking. Arriving in Dhaka would be a more pleasant experience if baggage handling was more disciplined. It must be mentioned that people who have travelled to Dhaka over the last few years will definitely appreciate that things are however much better that they used to be.,,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Mazharul Bhuiyan,,More qualified & smart people should work at the immigration. Most of them do not know about transit visas tourist visas and rules followed by other major countries. I always find them asking to their so called seniors for advise. The parking area has become a taxi stand for the unmarked microbuses. There should be specific number of airport taxis and no authorized help person at the arrival hall otherwise the re-entry is horrible. This country will take long time to rise if the airport is not found friendly and comfortable by the foreign visitors/investors.,,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Wasim Choudhury,,Zia Airport - though improved still needs a lot of help. While the airport has new boarding gates and the arrivals now boast new luggage belts the appearance of the airport is still cute unclean and the layout leaves a lot to desire for. On arrival why do passengers have to go through such long series of stairs to the immigration area? I noticed some elderly folks with large carry on pieces struggling to walk down those stairs. In the arrivals hall immigration processing is way too slow. Under a new directive all information is keyed in computers to a database while a passenger enters and exits the country. Unfortunately this takes an incredible amount of time to enter all the info. I don't know why the process cannot be streamlined by scanning the passport info into a database and the keying in done at some other location at a later time. The customs area is working in better condition and I am very glad for it. The area where passengers take cars from the arrivals area is still chaotic although blocking general public access is a good idea. They still need to filter out taxi/porter and agents from this area. The departure immigration procedure is equally painful. I nearly missed my flight waiting for the line to move. It took 40 minutes for the 6 passengers in front of me to clear immigration. Boarding gates are ok but can they not put news on the tv in waiting areas rather than music tv? I guess that is partly due to the taste of the passengers so I can't complain much. As for the domestic terminal it runs a lot better than the international one. Check is for the two airlines is neat and easy. The terminal lounge is clean. The arrivals area is now graced with a luggage belt so it is definitely more efficient.,,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Riaz Osmani,,Improvement within a span of a couple of years. Hopefully more to come. It's no Singapore or Dubai but it's no Mumbai or Calcutta either. Small efficient and tidy for the most part. Transit passengers may be bored during long breaks. Not a lot to do. Next improvement must involve changing of several security personnel who ruin the day by their misguided pride in their work. First time foreigners with no one to meet may still be perplexed at the chaos once outside the neat terminal.,,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Asif Chaudhury,,ZIA has gone through extensive renovations and has become an excellent airport. The new departure terminal is very comfortable. The new VIP Lounge for business and first class passengers is excellent. Impressive!,,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Mamun Mahmud,,I have flown 8 outbound and 7 inbound international flights through ZIA in last seven years. The airport checking-in and immigration layouts have been remarkably improved during last two years. The departure portion is now comparable to most other international airports. The new parking structure attached to the main terminal is a great job done. The arrival portion is still messy specially outside the airport. Placing transparent glass between the baggage unloading people and the baggage claiming passengers has also reduced the baggage cutting (stealing) disasters. Thanks ZIA. We would like to see more continuous improvements.,,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Rezwar Harron,,Luggage handling for arriving passengers takes a very long time. One can also see the handlers tossing luggage on the conveyor belts not a pretty site. A yellow cab booth should be opened somewhere inside the terminal building so people don't get hassled by the cab drivers and middle men.,,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Shadman Salem,,Zia Intl Airport have gone through some renovations lately to make it in to a functional clean and comfortable airport for travelers. However one area where there's a lot of scope for improvement is the duty free shop. Going in to the duty shop at the Dhaka airport foreigners would definitely want to find stuff to take back home that represent Bangladesh. Currently there's very little in that shop that gives an essence of Bangladesh.,,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Nazrul Islam,,Why don't we see and real-time arrival/departures for ZIA international airport at Dhaka ? Does this airport consider itself a major airport ? It must link it's real-time flight arrival/departures to internet sites which would be very valuable contribution towards passenger satisfaction.,,0
dhaka-zia-airport,Asif Chaudhury,,Dhaka's Zia International Airport has improved a lot in the past few years. Even though it is not comparable to other major airports Zia Intl. is in very good condition compared to airports in India & Pakistan and the rest of the region. The departure and arrival terminals are comfortable and well maintained.,,0
dinard-airport,J Mathews,United Kingdom,Had the misfortune to travel through this cow shed last week. The small quantity of multitasking staff there are more than happy to do as little as possible and ensure that everyone has an unpleasant experience. The customs and security staff especially behave as if they are secret police in charge of the White House rather than some backwater airfield. You have to queue too long for everything if you have to check a bag in you will have to show your passport and boarding pass to 4 separate people at different stages who are all within 20 meters of each other. What is the point of this - just jobs for the boys no doubt. When you have reached the departure lounge you find not enough seats 3 small air conditioners which are all useless. You will only find a couple of vending machines which don't accept notes only coins. I had to go back out through security to get some change for the vending machines. The 2 security staff members I tried talking to refused to speak English to me when only 5 minutes earlier I had heard them talking decent English with another passenger. Finally I found someone who would talk English and explained to them why I needed to return land side. All in all a very unpleasant experience I recommend anyone not to use this pathetic excuse of an airport.,,0
dinard-airport,Blaeke Downie,United Kingdom,Though they only have 2 or 3 flights a day mainly budget airlines the queues are never ending and final calls for outbound flights are broadcast before the inbound aircraft has even landed. The stress levels that you will experience travelling through DNR are comparable to no other airport I have experienced. The unfriendly staff go out of their way to make your journey unpleasant. Services and facilities at this airport are non-existent which is understandable due to the very low number of flights it is basically just a shed in a field with a runway. I would suggest avoiding DNR at all costs and using BA or AirFrance to fly to NTE (Nantes) or ANE (Angers) or UIP (Quimper) as an alternative.,2,0
djibouti-ambouli-airport,D Hananel,United States,Small airport that you would not want to spend too much time in but that manages to get you on your way reasonably quickly. Inbound immigration and visa on arrival facilities are slightly chaotic though not too bad. Outbound once you clear passport control facilities are limited to not-so-clean toilets a sad looking duty free shop a bar that did not have any change when we visited and a seating area that seemed to be full of mosquitos. If you've stayed in the Kempinski you can use their lounge which is probably the best part of this airport.,3,0
djibouti-ambouli-airport,W Rollason,,Chaos from the time we checked in to the time we got aboard the plane. On arrival we were herded into a small arrivals area with people wandering around trying to find out whether we get our visas first or our passports stamped first. No organisation whatsoever. Departure was delayed by 4+hrs and this airport is not the one you would choose to be delayed in. Toilets were available but were in a disgusting state. The Duty free shop was nearly empty and the range offered very small that is unless you wanted perfume,,0
djibouti-ambouli-airport,Karen Glynn,,Departure Tax - reported to be $30 or EUR25. We didn't have to pay it. There was a passport check prior to getting our visas stamped where 'tax' was mentioned. We just looked blank at this and the guy who actually stamped the passport didn't ask us again. Facilities: well not really up to an international airports. There are toilets and a bar and two or three little shops but that's about it.,,0
doha-airport,Jay Toronto,Canada,I flew from YYZ to AMD via Doha (old airport). Overall experience is not so bad except transporting to plane by coach. Embarking from and boarding to plane is by coach but overall management of coaches are good. Security check is quite fast and not so much hold up. Security personal are not checking for liquid in your hand baggage and line moves really nicely. This is for transfer and not sure about passenger boarding from Doha. Airport terminal is quite clean and roomy. Good part is there is a nice play area for young kids and reasonably good quality free WiFi. Washroom are no so clean mainly due to culture of people using them and mostly wet. In rush hours it is crawded and also sometime close one in middle due to close off that area (US bond flights). Not so much food option but overall food is not so costly compare to European airports. Ground staff are not that helpful but Qatar Airways staff are excellent. I missed new terminal by only 4-5 days.,7,1
doha-airport,D Hutchinson,United States,I was here on a stopover on the way to Bangkok. I didn't have too many problems and the terminal wasn't that crowded (it was early morning). Also free internet worked well which was helpful. Staff seemed friendly though not really helpful. The toilets were overcrowded and not clean. Not many shops or restaurants that I saw. Overall this airport is nothing to right home about but my experience wasn't that bad. Qatar airways is a good airline and hopefully the new airport in Doha is better than Doha international.,6,1
doha-airport,G James,United Kingdom,Passed through Doha on both 25th March and 15th April. Very disappointed with business class lounge which was very crowded and hectic. Couldn't find a cup to pour coffee in! Not anywhere close to buffet. Differing advice about our time and gate of departure meant we only had ten minutes to spare. The gates were in chaos Didn't appreciate having to climb stairs to board. Doha really wants to shake itself and look to the super business class lounge they have at Heathrow.,5,0
doha-airport,F Mustafa,Singapore,Arrived with our baby myself and my husband were forced to get on the fully packed bus that brought us to the arrival terminal as my request to wait for the next bus was denied. As such I had to struggle while carrying my baby in my arms through the dreadful bus ride standing and trying not to fall on anyone while the bus made sharp turns during the 20 minute ride. No one offered me a seat as expected because no one sitting or standing near any seats could see me carrying a baby in that super crowded bus. No assistance or clear information regarding a fast lane at the immigration hall. Immigration officer was very rude and made us go to another counter at the other end of the immigration hall. Our passports were handed over to three different officers and when asked why and what was happening all questions were ignored and we were treated as though we were invisible as they spoke to each other in Arabic. Horrible experience and airport is a far cry from any other airports I have passed through. And very stressful for someone like us travelling with a baby.,1,0
doha-airport,Chris Hall,Australia,Very sad airport. There seems to be plenty of toilet cleaners but the toilets are crowded not so clean and far too few in numbers. The business class lounge is the worst I have seen. The options for eating are severely limited Costas and one other similar place. Not very exciting for a delay of several hours. The single runway means every plane is going to be late. The runway just cannot handle the number of flights and then the terminal cannot handle the number of passengers. We waited one hour to land circled at 15000 feet and then later for the next flight sat on the tarmac all ready to go for 70 minutes before actually taking off. The staff are amiable but unhelpful. The transfer desk was overwhelmed trying to arrange the hordes of passengers who missed flights. The new airport or new terminal has been rumoured to be coming soon for the last couple of years. Alas too late they have lost me.,1,0
doha-airport,J Powles,United Kingdom,"Disabled assistance at Doha airport is incredibly chaotic and inefficient. I have vowed never to fly Qatar Airways again after this. Upon arrival my disabled husband and I were herded into a ""special area"". Our passports were taken off us. About 15 mins before our flight was to depart I began to panic and make a fuss (otherwise we weren't going anywhere). They finally loaded us and another disabled passenger onto a special bus to take us to the plane. About 5 mins on the other passengers noticed that they had left her bag with her passport/boarding pass behind so we had to go back. Finally with all bags we get to the plane and the flight has been closed they had to radio for permission from the pilot to reopen the door to let us on. This was granted thankfully and has now delayed the flight. And also no surprise the seat needed by my husband due to his disability had been commandeered by a passenger thinking we hadn't turned up. Don't travel via Doha Airport if you need special/disabled assistance.",,0
doha-airport,D Gerrish,United Kingdom,Whilst I agree about the time taken to get to the plane by bus I felt that I should add my recent experience of Doha International Airport to redress the balance somewhat. I found it to be a smooth trouble free experience. It took approx 25 minutes from the time that we left our hotel in Doha to the time we were sitting at the gate waiting for our plane to be called (admittedly this was at midnight). There were lots of people about but minimal queues everywhere and the staff that we had cause to speak to were friendly and helpful (including the security man). Perhaps it's a different experience when you're not a transit passenger?,8,1
doha-airport,Nick Turner,Australia,After flying from LHR I had a 1 hour transfer before flying on to Western Australia. This was my first experience of Doha and it wasn't great a 20 minute bus journey took us from the plane to the quick transfer building where I wandered about trying to find the gate the usual queues for security etc. followed by another 20 minute bus journey back to the next aircraft. No time for the toilet food or shopping. Airport was incredibly busy narrow walkways make movement difficult. Hopefully my return (June) will be better but can't imagine I'll be back after that.,,0
doha-airport,I Newton,United Kingdom,Will avoid in future. We were in transit and after a long bus ride in (nearly 20 mins) from the plane there was a long queue to clear security where despite being on the colour coded short transfer queue we found the world and his wife going through the supposedly quick short transfer queue to avoid the long queue in ordinary transfer queue. None of the airport staff seemed to care so what's the point ? As a result we only just made our transfer time and then had another 19 minute bus ride out to the next plane (I timed it). The toilet in the terminal was so crowded and smelly we didn't bother use them. Forty minutes in a bus and queues for thirty minutes just to get onto a plane parked 200 metres from the one we landed in! Never again.,1,0
doha-airport,M Pemberton,France,It has all been said by other reviewers but I am so angry with this airport that I will add to the comments. Long bus ride long queues for everything (passport control duty free toilets - I tried three and gave up) then another long bus ride. In and out of the planes up outside steps in the heat or rain. Truly horrible experience at 1am after an already long flight surreal really. Would not fly Qatar again whilst they are using this airport (and I may not bother even when they move to the new airport).,2,0
doha-airport,Simon E Greenwood,Thailand,Flew through again on the 19th of December and the new terminal really is needed. Forty minutes of bus journeys and over crowded business lounge again. In addition Qatar airways do not let platinum/emerald card holders use the 1st class lounge!,2,0
doha-airport,V Loras,United Kingdom,Flew into Doha Airport from London. We had a 6 hour transit before heading to Bangkok. Arrived at 2am and it felt like a ghost town. We were traveling in Business on Qatar and the Business lounge wasn't very good compared to other countries. It's very over rated and as a seasoned traveler I was very disappointed with the lack of 24 hour service I have had in Asian airports. The lounge already feels very worn and tattered and they only served tea and coffee and soggy sandwiches. If they are trying to compete with Dubai they have no chance in winning. Even compared to old European lounges it didn't strike me as anything too exciting. We even took the shuttle bus to the main airport and the lounge there was tiny and packed so we came back to the Qatar business lounge.,4,0
doha-airport,Paul Roberts,Switzerland,Stopped at Doha airport for a two hour transit en route ZUR-MEL. Even with a young baby it wasn't as bad as I had expected. The bus ride was long but thankfully my wife and child had a seat. Going through security when arriving at the departure terminal took no more than 5 mins. Security at the gate also took no more than 10 mins. Even though we were there during the midnight rush it was busy but not uncomfortable.,7,0
doha-airport,Farouk Mogheth,Thailand,Connected from Bangkok to Cairo and back. First experience in Doha. The colour system they have for various passengers is great (yellow tags and cards for transfers Orange for quick transfers etc.). The terminal itself is just a glass box (I expected a larger venue) but functioned well. Clean with a couple of shops here and there but I believe the new airport is to open soon and would reflect Qatar's ambition to offer a world class airport. This one works but lets say it lacks any lustre for me its a non issue as long as all worked fine. The internet is free and appreciated even though works only on one side of the terminal and closer to gate 20 21 22 the signal is barely there and connection almost impossible. Staff are polite especially in the x-ray checks (which is a big issue for me especially in other Middle eastern airports). The only negative point is the people jammed downstairs when boarding the bus. For 2 flights the passengers were lead down but the bus wasn't there yet and it was very uncomfortable having a small room packed with people kids and screaming toddlers. But all in all it went rather well. Toilets need a bit of a face lift!,7,1
doha-airport,Martin Mitchell,United Kingdom,Transited here twice during November 2013. As others have pointed out the bus transfers from the plan are the longest I have ever come across - and there is the inevitable confusion for some passengers between the Doha arrival and transit/departures stop which can cause some chaos. Overall the airport terminal for transit was not as bad as I feared - plenty of seats in the downstairs area and a nice coffee shop close to the toilets. However buying anything from duty free is a slow process - I tried to buy a bottle of water and had to wait nearly 10 minutes while the cashier filled out volumes of paperwork for another customer who was just buying one bottle of whisky. And after all the drama the passenger left his boarding card behind! Its bearable as a transit stop - but the sooner the new Doha airport opens the better. I was there in November - so maybe that is why it seemed quieter!,5,1
doha-airport,Alasdair Brooks,United Arab Emirates,Perhaps I've been lucky with the immigration queues but I've found immigration in and out of Doha to be fairly quick and straightforward - though make sure you have a credit card to cover the visa fee; they don't take cash. But I wouldn't want to be a transit passenger here; there aren't enough seats the air side food options are dismal there's hardly anywhere to plug in electronic equipment and the shopping is surprisingly poor; if I was in transit for more than a couple of hours I'd seriously consider paying for Oryx Lounge access (and maybe that's the intention). That every flight I've taken to and from Doha seems to involve a long bus drive from the gate to and from the actual plane is also a minus - and often confusing to people who haven't used the airport before. While hardly awful Doha is too small and too dated an airport to properly serve as the major regional transit hub its primary airline and its government both want; in that sense the sooner the new airport opens the better.,5,0
doha-airport,Thomas Johnston,United Kingdom,As I had only 1 hour 20 minutes between landing from Manchester and catching the next flight to Bangkok I'd booked the Al Maha fast track service which I can really recommend I was rushed through the usual crowds and chaos of Doha and escorted direct to the departure gate so I can't really comment about delays etc although the terminal seemed to be a crowded as usual. On my return flight I'd used Q-miles to upgrade to business from Doha to Manchester as I was in transit for 8 hours the premier terminal is the place to be if you have 8 hours with nothing to be expect sit and wait for the next flight a fine choice of foods and top class staff there seem to be more of them since my last visit I just hope the HAMAD finally opens they'll have done something about the crowds and queues. Most of the below marks are based on premier terminal.,10,1
doha-airport,M J Mathew,Qatar,Every time I am at the airport I see at least half the passengers disembark on the wrong section (transit) and I find them coming back. This takes too much time just because the busses we travel do not have voice over instructions. This could save ground staff so much hassle. The crowd in immigration is usually quite large but the egate card works for us.,3,0
doha-airport,B Josef,United Arab Emirates,This airport is a joke for all the tall claims Qatar Airways or their ads make. The Airport is a disaster starting with the longest bus ride from the plane to the Terminal (at time waiting at the door of the plane as the Bus has not yet found its way to us). Once you get to the terminal things get worse. There are two or three outlets where you can buy food. The selection is rubbish service is shabby. The prices are over the top. The available lounges are small and most of the time they refuse to honour the complimentary access assured by our Credit Cards (Platinum and above). I would hate to be stranded there more than an hour or so.,1,0
doha-airport,Federico Muscogiuri,Spain,To the previous reviewer: are you sure you are talking about Doha airport? The airport of 2-3 wide-body jets arriving at the same time at 1 am and turning the security area into mayhem. Small and cramped departure areas where people are herded one hour before the boarding and are forced to sit on the floor due to lack of seating? Dingy and smelly toilets. Long bus rides around the runway where often the driver is himself unsure at which aircraft he has to stop. Surly and brusque customer service? Bad ventilation and simply not enough space to contain QR expansion. My last experience was all of the above and worse. Much as I like flying QR I hate this airport and will avoid it until the new terminal opens.,1,0
doha-airport,S Smith,United Kingdom,I cannot understand the very bad reviews of this airport. My husband and I are in our 60's. We had a stop over in Doha visa everything went smoothly. Check in back at the airport fine. The departure lounge is fine eating and shopping. Toilets no problem. We found a seat again without a problem. The bus ride to and from the plane does not take long buses are used in lots of airports. (Our flight arrived in Doha at 01.15am and our departure was 08.45am). We shall have no hesitation when next we travel to Malaysia to use Qatar airways with a stopover in Doha.,9,1
doha-airport,Faustino Asprilla,Netherlands,I found arrival with Qatar Airways excellent customs was fast and for the region ok in friendliness. Visa upon arrival possible by credit card and directly at customs check though depending on nationality I guess. Taxis wait outside just around the corner. I found especially departure in the main terminal disturbing for Qatar-standards. I must again admit that check-in customs and security-checks went smooth and fast however that is it. There are few shops that basically all sell the same tax-free items if not coffee. Most disappointing was the food court and choice it was probably amongst some of the poorest I ever seen after travelling to quite some airports in different parts of the world. There are hardly tables available and half of them is reserved for airport and airline staff of which some noisy as well. Ordering service was chaotic and food quality was below average. Also the fact bus transport is used for every flight where you would have expected air-conditioned walking bridges in Qatar instead is a very annoying thing and may indeed take a while to reach the airplane. Toilets not clean and smelly as well. Too bad for Qatar Airways.,5,0
doha-airport,H S Kaplaner,Turkey,Qatar is a great airline however Doha is the worst airport for a transits. No airbridges long bus rides from aircraft to terminals (very confusing system) crowded toilets even in the middle of the night. It was very tiring and wouldn't want to fly through Doha again.,3,0
doha-airport,A Orchard,United Kingdom,Travelled through Doha in September. Very cheap airport lots of bargains in duty free shops very cheap beverages and food. Waited four hours for next plane on the way back to London and because it was after midnight airport was quiet with plenty of seats in the main area and Quiet Zone. Different story on the way to Bangkok. Late afternoon on the way to Bangkok completely different story. Overcrowded dirty toilets no seating left. Smoking rooms are a big joke avoid if you can no sufficient ventilation and too many people inside. Bus service to and from the plane was fast. Overall would not recommend this airport for staying longer than one hour.,5,0
doha-airport,James Laskowski,Thailand,"This has got to be one of the worst airports I have been in. Mainly due to the archaic use of busses that take over 20 minutes to get to and from the aircraft to the terminal. And then when checking in with the extremely polite staff everyone must hurdle into a 2nd waiting room to wait for the bus. The lack of services at the airport are very poor. 2 or 3 restrooms tops that have a line out the door for men are packed and in locations not convenient to all passenger waiting areas. Since the current airport is so small the food and shopping options are extremely limited and the shopping is limited to duty free items (and over-priced electronics). The 1 great thing about this airport is the ""Quiet Area"" where it is dark reclining seats and very quiet if you have a long layover. Made for nice place to nap.",4,0
doha-airport,R Brennan,Australia,This airport desperate for an upgrade. The big fancy new Doha airport has had its opening delayed for several years and it shows as Qatar Airlines continues to expand its massive fleet despite the tiny overwhelmed airport that serves as its transit hub. A few problems to note: 1) The bathrooms would be a disgrace for even a small regional airport let alone a global hub. You would be forgiven for thinking the bathroom line is for boarding a plane because it stretches across the halls. Once you reach the inside there are more sinks than toilets. 2) During peak hours people are camped out all over the floors due to the lack of seats. Sleep is impossible because of the crowds. 3) Perhaps overwhelmed by it all staff are generally friendly but unhelpful or surly and unhelpful. For far fewer flights this would be a decently modern little airport. However when crammed in with the rest of the cattle it feels like a terrible place to be. When compared to the hub airports of the other 5 star airlines on skytrax (Singapore Hong Kong Kuala Lumpur - all of which I visited in the last year) it is a joke.,1,0
doha-airport,J Overgaard,Denmark,Travelling with QR we have visit Doha Int Airport every year for the last 6 years. Service and conditions at the Airport is ok for us. We have no problems to find seats while waiting in transit however the toilets area I have seen better in other airports. The main issue for us is how long time it takes to go by bus from the aircraft to the airport. Our experience is from 10 to 25 minutes which is long time when the departure time is 45 minutes. This year July we didn't have to be checked arriving the airport and I have never understand why they check people who arrives in transit. We look forward to see the new Airport next year so we don't have to go by bus from aircraft to terminal.,7,1
doha-airport,S Padinj,United States,Airport does not have enough space to handle all transit passengers. There is nowhere near enough seating and toilets. Having to queue outside the mens toilets was a new experience for me and I felt very sorry for female passengers who had longer queues outside their toilets. Avoid Doha if you possibly can.,1,0
doha-airport,Anil Tanwani,Nigeria,Airport staff were very humble. The only drawback was the bus ride after exiting the aircraft until you reach the airport. It was really very tiring and hectic. A complete modern airport is much awaited where you disembark from the aircraft directly into the main airport.,6,1
doha-airport,K Standen,Australia,Transiting through this airport at around midnight is horrifying. There is no where near enough seating and toilets. Having to queue outside mens toilets was a new experience for me and I felt very sorry for female passengers who had longer queues outside their toilets. Avoid Doha if you possibly can.,,0
doha-airport,P Porter,Australia,Billions spent on the new terminal but someone seriously miscalculated the number of toilets required. Security staff rude and I have doubts about their efficiency. My hand luggage was x-rayed twice notwithstanding that I was in transit and it had been done thoroughly in Milan. Curiously my person was not searched during these checks. It is difficult to see the logic. The bus journey from the aircraft seemed never ending. I thought this was supposed to end once the new terminal had opened. I could not find any water fountains/coolers.,1,0
doha-airport,J Myers,Australia,Great network of destinations and cabin/flight crew excellent but ground staff and Doha airport simply not up to the job. Had an uncomplicated transfer through on way to Europe though lengthy bus rides standing to/from tarmac and lack of airbridge onto plane problematic for older passengers with mobility issues. Check-in in Europe for return trip went smoothly purchased some duty free goods after checking in luggage and accepted as carryon to Doha in the usual sealed plastic bag. Passed through security again into Doha airport without comment when we were bussed into the terminal for a 2 hour transit. Had difficulty accessing departure gate due to long queues. Walked around to gate lounge that appeared to also have access to correct lounge but apparently did not lengthy redirection by ground staff and instead of being 15 mins ahead of check-in for ongoing flight we were 2 minutes late gate had been closed and we were off the flight with 24 hrs to spend in Doha airport. Went to board the ongoing flight and all our duty free was confiscated as was the duty free alcohol purchases of many other passengers including transit passengers who'd purchased in Doha. Final insult was to get home nearly 48 hours after starting our trip to find our luggage had not been placed on our flight despite repeated assurances that it would be. Facilities and processes on the ground are insufficient to cope with the rapidly expanding flight schedule and staff do not have sufficient support to retain customer focus. And I would agree with other reviewers regarding minimal toilets!,2,0
doha-airport,Maurice Guiney,Thailand,On arrival (for work) after midnight on a Monday night had to wait about 2 hours to get through immigration - this considered regular traffic. On departure 3 weeks later arrived at airport early checked in and went through to find its US$40 for access to the pay-in lounge where I could get an alcoholic drink.,,0
doha-airport,Llewellyn van der Berg,South Africa,The Airport terminal is pleasant enough and Duty Free Prices were average. Main complaint is there are too few toilets far too few. Every toilet was packed to capacity. With the number of people moving through there they need to improve that. Also if people are lying under the pay phones to charge iPhones and laptops then make a proper charge station to accommodate these people. There are charge stations but as with the toilets it is designed for half the volume that the airport can handle. Would rather fly Emirates next time.,5,0
doha-airport,A Manconi,Italy,Transited 2 times this month at DOH airport. Crowded but fast security checks. Nice and efficient personnel at transit desk information and gates. The negative aspect is the dirty toilets!,4,0
doha-airport,Alexander Speer,United Kingdom,Writing this from the Oryx lounge in Doha. Can't say much about the main terminal but as far as I could see it was packed. Oryx lounge good (costs $40 USD per person) not much food option but got good shower with towel you can borrow. Toilets and shower are cleaned every so often and were in excellent condition. Computers and WIFI internet provided free of charge even the printer is free to use! As for the food for about 18 hours I was living off Pepsi bread and butter and a mushroom soup but the staff are friendly. Oryx lounge is recommended if you got a long layover but not if your layover is under 2 hrs to 2.5 hrs.,8,1
doha-airport,Robert Szocik,United Kingdom,Transiting to/from LHR and HKG. The airport is clearly in transition as the opening of NDIA approaches. The terminal is still massively overcrowded even at 0300 but it's quite easy to find a seat as seats are everywhere. The new colour-coded transfer card system works well and clearing security only takes a few minutes even when several wide-body aircraft arrive at the same time. Staff are friendly and helpful with no hassle at security. Toilets rarely stay clean for long – the cleaners work very hard but they simply can't cope with the huge volume of pax. Shops are still cheap compared to other airports especially for bottled water. The biggest issue is probably the bus ride to/from the aircraft – this must surely now be the world's longest aircraft-to-terminal bus ride – the distances are huge! Announcements are infrequent which must lead to many missed connections. Unlike some I quite like transiting here but the new airport is eagerly awaited.,7,1
doha-airport,Rob Hurn,United Kingdom,We had about an hour between flights at Doha (RGN-DOH-LHR). On arrival we spent many minutes cruising round the edge of the airport in a transfer bus eventually got to the transfer gate the fast transfer lanes were closed but no queue at all at normal-speed lanes so no problem. Arrived at departure gate as it was due to open admired once again the confusing way a flight disappears from the gates display screen list as soon as the gate is opened. Our flight was delayed so we hung around for half an hour. They don't make announcements about delays over the PA because it is a 'quiet airport' (no-one told the lady who was using the PA to tell us not to smoke). Suddenly the gate was open we moved forward but great efforts were made to persuade us to sit down again to avoid an unsightly queue but we resolutely kept standing and submitted ourselves to the first of 3 back to back ID checks. Got to the gate itself (check number two) and down an escalator to a tatty ground floor area waiting for access to the transit bus two of which were parked by the doors. The escalator continued to bring more and more people down from upstairs. Still no exit was allowed to the bus. A man struggled through the crowd with a key. It didn't fit the door lock. The escalator had been turned off by now to stop people tripping over each other at the bottom. The man tried the other door. An ironic cheer went up as the door opened. Time for our third ID check and on to the bus which then didn't leave for a few minutes even though it was obvious more the one bus would be needed. We set off on another extended tour of the airport perimeter and arrived at the foot of the aircraft's steps. Naturally only the rear door was available to us Economy class passengers so boarding was slow. All in all not a brilliant experience. Hope the new terminal opens soon and is better than the current one.,4,0
doha-airport,Jenalyn Ramos,United Arab Emirates,Not satisfied at Doha transfer desk section service is poor. They don't have enough staff at the counter desks there were 9 counters but only 3 staff members assisting the long queue of passengers. No special/fast track counter desk for transfer passengers with only an hour allowance and who have to be assisted very quickly for an immediate transfer. As a result passengers asking for a quick assistance seem like they are begging for service with transfer desk staffs and fighting with a fellow passengers at queue jump to avoid missing the flights. Please improve your service hoping to have a very fast and smooth transfer on our next flight.,3,0
doha-airport,M Bertram,Australia,We just transited through here on our way to Amman and found the experience much less stressful than we had expected. By the time we disembarked from our first flight our next flight was already boarding but the flight attendants assured us it would be fine. The longest part was the bus ride as we flew J class to Doha and then were flying Economy to Amman so the bus first dropped the continuing J class passengers at the Premium Terminal before going to Arrivals and finally to the Transfer terminal. Once inside I was pleasantly surprised. The security check lines were moving very quickly and in about 10 minutes we were at the gate ready to board the bus.,8,1
doha-airport,Laurence Wheeler,United Kingdom,Great airline but what a shambles at Doha it is not a pleasant experience. Flew MAN-DOH-KUL with 1.5 hrs change time outbound and 1hr 45mins return. All transfers appear to be by bus but this is very poor. The ground staff have a completely lackadaisical attitude it is 15 minutes before you can disembark then a wait on the bus while the driver chats with his mates. Elementary things like vans being parked on the bus ways delay you even further on what feels like several km from plane to terminal. We only went through security on the return journey for some reason and there were long snaking queues but the actually processing was OK. When you get to the departure hall it is not too bad with some nice outlets like Costa that take cards for small amounts for no surcharge. Not that you will get time to use them as they are calling flights for ‘immediate boarding’ 50 mins before time. None of this was in any way relaxing given the ridiculously short transfer times booked by Qatar Airlines; one party we met had been allowed 31 minutes. I think there is a ‘new airport’ under construction. Until then I would recommend that nobody accepts itineraries that have less than say three hours for transfer or avoid the place altogether.,2,0
doha-airport,David G Stein,United States,I transited at Doha Airport. I understand that the airport is in flux with new terminal about to be opened. What appears to be confusing at first turned out to be just fine. I had a 6 hour layover and took advantage of the quiet in Oryx Lounge for $39. For me it was a good value as I was able to take a shower have a snack at the buffet and a short nap. Waiting in the general transit terminal would haven crowded noisy and services would have been few. On my way home I had only 30 minutes to transit because my first flight arrived late. I managed to get though to layers of security with ease and board my flight on time.,5,1
doha-airport,Navin Kuriakose,Kuwait,The airport is small. That's what you'll notice first. Duty Free Selection is excellent. Duty Free staff are very helpful too. The eating out choices are mediocre two or three fast food joint upstairs. According to me the maximum lay over time you can spend here is 2 hrs. Unless of course you have lounge access.,7,1
doha-airport,A Sargeant,United Kingdom,Transited through twice in last week. Airport is of ok quality quite compact lots of seating but generally had over crowded feel which let down the experience. Lack of food outlets and ones available seemed full / lots of rubbish about. Main ground floor is mostly filled by large duty free shop. Problem with airport is buses from planes to/from terminal does give it the feel and look of a fancy bus station. Going to far side of runway from / to terminal takes ages (15 mins) on the bus and can stand on the bus waiting another 15 mins waiting for buses in front to let people board the plane before allowed off. Will wait to the New Doha Airport opens before every go through again.,4,0
doha-airport,H Spliet,Australia,"Doha airport is not a place to spend more than an hour in transit. Very poor facilities for longer stopovers. The bus trip from plane to terminal is not a pleasant experience as the journey can take more than 15 minutes and after a long flight the last thing you want is to ""strap hang"" in a bus which has very limited seating. I would not travel with Qatar again until it upgrades the Doha airport facilities. Even though I have travelled both business class (superb) and economy class (not much better than other airlines) I would not fly Qatar again unless the transit time is no more than one hour. Doha airport is dry (unless you can access the first and business class lounges) yet on the contrary the outbound duty free has a large range of liquor products at very good prices.",,0
doha-airport,Rosemary Arnold,United Kingdom,Arrived Doha en route Shanghai to Heathrow. Damaged an already inflamed Achilles tendon on stepping up to shuttle bus. On arrival at terminal an official made me sit down whilst he fetched a wheelchair. From then on it was priority treatment. Staff could not have been more kind or friendly. Had travelled out through Doha. Found terminal clean uncrowded with easy to follow signs. Speak as you find and I found them wonderful.,10,1
doha-airport,Tom Johnston,United Kingdom,Other than having to travel between the aircraft and the terminal by bus I have no problems with Doha but my review is based on travelling business class but I've never had any serious problems when flying economy. The new airport should be open soon so its goodbye to the free tour of the airport by bus.,10,1
doha-airport,A Stevenson,United Kingdom,The original terminal which I used to pass through frequently in the 1990’s seems to have disappeared to be replaced with a larger more modern building which is only a temporary terminal pending opening of the new Doha Airport. There are no airbridges so passengers are bussed to and from the terminal. Many connecting flights have short transfer times (mine was 50 minutes) which considering the time needed to travel to and from the terminal makes for a rushed and somewhat stressful transfer experience. I had been given an orange and yellow trimmed ‘short transfer’ boarding pass on check in with instructions from Qatar Airways to make this visible on arrival at Doha and to follow instructions. As it turned out no one was interested and there were no ‘short transfer’ lanes open or anyone offering assistance. Fortunately it was easy enough to identify my departure gate which was only a short walk away. The terminal itself is rather basic and functional and still too small for the number of passengers using it but easy to navigate and seems to do its job effectively enough. I was also impressed that my bags made the connection but all in all not a particularly enjoyable experience.,4,0
doha-airport,D Gibert,Vanuatu,I used this airport with my wife and kids on the way to and from Singapore to Paris flying with Qatar Airways. We did not disembark into a terminal but into buses waiting on the tarmac to bring us to the transit terminal in the middle of the night. The trips in the buses were long we were stuck in one of them for 20 minutes at the bottom of the aircraft waiting to board the aircraft the driving style of the drivers was anything but smooth. The terminal itself was drab and looked very old and tired with nothing to do in it (no duty free hardly any food outlets).,2,0
doha-airport,Yevheniy Kahanovych,Ukraine,Very smooth and fast on the short transit but unpleasant and boring for 14 hours stay on my way back home through it. Freezing cold aircon late at night only three tiny coffee outlets. Two smallish food courts with very limited choice (moderately priced though). Duty free there was a total disappointment in terms of choice and prices. Toilets were clean and well stocked. Used paid lounge (Oryx) and was disappointed with selection of snacks (almost nothing to eat) quality of pastries selection of drinks. Overall the facility just does its business but nothing more. Hope the new terminal will be what Qatar Airways deserves.,6,0
doha-airport,H Taniwidjojo,Indonesia,It is a pity that after a great flight with Qatar Airways from CGK I have to experience a lot of discomfort from very long bus trip from the plane to the terminal limited food stalls limited rest rooms and short of seats. I do not think I will fly with Qatar Airways again although this is one of the best economy class I have ever experienced. It is hard to believe that the bus trip from the plane to the terminal or the opposite can take more than 30 minutes while most of the passenger are without seat it is very much torturing.,4,0
doha-airport,R Graham,United Kingdom,As a special assistance customer I was terrified of transiting Doha Airport after reading other reviews. However my experience could not have been more delightful. Upon parking at the stand myself and all other special assistance passengers were disembarked using a lift vehicle and driven in it to the transfer terminal. There we were seated in a reserved area then taken swiftly through security. I was taken to the smoking area whilst my wife checked us in and then we waited for a bus to take us to the aircraft. We again used a lift car to enter it. Super job most efficient.,10,1
doha-airport,M Wanke,Germany,"Passed though DOH to and from Asia. The transit is pretty unpleasant. All stories about the crowds and queues and bus rides are true. Security check was fast took about 10 minutes. There weren't enough areas for sitting. One quiet zone with about 40 impressive uncomfortable seats with fridge-atmosphere. Another quiet zone with more seats and a little bit warmer doesn't deserve to be named ""quiet"". Lavatories provide just warm water but are clean at least. For people in economy there should at least be a little better organization.",3,0
doha-airport,Andrew Maile,Indonesia,Travelled through this airport twice last month and overall impression was that it is below average. The biggest problem is that there are no airbridges onto the plane so in order to board the aircraft you go down an escalator into a very cramped 'holding area' with hardly any seats before boarding a bus for the very long journey out to the plane. Very poor indeed. Other facilities are quite basic with small crowded and dirty toilets and a general air of overcrowding including a horrendously long queue to get into the Oryx lounge. The only positive was that there seemed to be a lot of Qatar Airways staff all around the terminal assisting passengers. I hope the new airport will provide a much better experience for passengers.,5,0
doha-airport,S Wong,United Kingdom,Good points: clean bright well signposted sleep lounge for economy passengers helpful staff. Bad points: small overcrowded not many food and beverage outlets sleep lounges have funny (and uncomfortable) curved loungers. Used buses to take passengers to/from aircraft and terminal. Confusing terminal instructions for passengers debarking.,6,0
doha-airport,N Sutherland,United States,Have to agree with the earlier posts. I could find only 3 toilets in the Transit Terminal Departures Area - all simultaneously out of operation. A freezing cold terminal in the middle of the night no facilities non functioning 'information' screens and lengthy bus rides all conspire to make Doha a fairly dismal place to make a connection. Why on earth have they scheduled so many flights transiting though an airport without a properly functioning terminal? Not recommended - and a poor advertisement for Qatar Airways who are clearly trying to deliver a quality product.,2,0
doha-airport,H Howell,United States,I found airport to be crowded and lacking in the number of rest rooms needed for the passenger traffic. The security lines after getting off the bus seemed daunting but use of looping lines seem to lessen the chaos. There were quite a few duty free shops but food and sundry outlets non-existent. Will not transfer in Qatar until the new terminal has been in use for at least a year.,5,0
doha-airport,Rod Catz,United Kingdom,Stayed in Doha 2 nights whilst doing Rome-Singapore. No air bridges. Bus out to plane on departing flight took 30 mins. Airport itself had 1 Costa Coffee outlet past immigration to serve the whole terminal. Toilets in the terminal serving around 12 gates had 2 cubicles and a queue. Would not go back to Doha until they open the new airport.,1,0
doha-airport,James Halley,United Kingdom,My only experience of transiting DOH in the past was as a J class passenger and having read the reviews of the airport for transiting 'down the back' I did wonder if I had done the right thing. The flight was an hour early and there transit terminal security check was deserted so there were no bad experiences and I was soon walking around the duty free shops. Cost of food in the food outlets seemed OTT but there is nothing new in that concept! Boarding for the onward connection was orderly although making everyone use the rear steps for boarding was a pain especially as the other steps wouldn't have disturbed the J class passengers (who in fact hadn't boarded anyway). I sincerely hope that the new airport will do away with the need for bussing (which is pretty much a thing of the past at most airports). Otherwise not half as bad as I feared!,6,1
doha-airport,Mike Rouse,United Kingdom,Hundreds of pushing people trying to get through two security gates queue jumpers shoving a few people nearly coming to blows and no air-conditioning. Once inside the facilities are not bad but could be better. This is my third time through the first two times were good but this last time it seems to be copying Heathrow for bad service.,1,0
doha-airport,Iskandar Illyas,Malaysia,Transit at Doha for SIN-MAD and BCN-SIN flights with Qatar Airways. Airport is absolute chaos. No airbridge long bus ride between plane and terminals confusing terminals unfriendly staff asking nonsense and unnecessary questions which slows down the boarding process. Very slow security clearance very limited seats. Toilets smell WIFI is almost non-existent and I don't even care to visit the duty free shops. Luckily our transit time was between 1-2 hours.,1,0
doha-airport,Alan Krawec,Canada,One of the strangest designs I've ever encountered. No air bridges. All aircraft are at remote stands requiring transfer buses a real pain in the summer heat. Multiple terminals (arrivals departures/transfers satellite transfer premium terminal). Departures/transfers terminal incredibly crowded even at 1 in the morning. Security lines can be long and slow. Duty free store crowded and difficult to get through. Sparse selection of magazines books and newspapers.,4,0
doha-airport,Ashraf Hoque,Bangladesh,I have been to Doha airport a couple of times as transit passenger. The airport is quite big but if we consider the amount of traffic it's handling it should be much bigger. When busy it's really over crowded and security check might take more than an hour to pass. Duty free is small but has a good collection of products. On the bright side toilets are pretty clean food in the restaurant is nice and plenty in amount announcement is very frequent. All in all nice airport just have to be much more bigger in floor space.,6,1
doha-airport,J Olfato,Singapore,Passed though DOH to and from Europe. The transit is nothing less than horrific. All stories about the chaos and queues and bus rides are true. People were already spilling out of the exit door because of the lines at the security check there was no line to speak of and it took me 40 mins to pass through. They are only using 4 of the 10-12 X-ray machines for hundreds of transiting passengers. There weren't enough areas for sitting. For people in economy there should at least be a little organization and cleanliness.,2,0
doha-airport,Ahmed Zuhairi,United Arab Emirates,First class Premium terminal. Luxury bus picks you up from plane with 15 seats. Premium terminal has a very limited duty free. There is a games room with a few PS3's and a nanny room to look after kids as well as a business centre. First class lounge was not busy. Food was enjoyable and included sushi and fresh exotic fruits. Had a 7 hour connection so was given a twin room which gave a comfortable 4 hour sleep. Spa treatment was overpriced so avoided that. An extremely enjoyable experience.,10,1
doha-airport,W Sweeney,United Kingdom,Does not have a lot to offer except the Oryx Lounge. You can book for 25 pounds (GBP) for use of 6 hours. It has showers complimentary food and drink (alcohol served until 2am but you have to ask for it at the food counters) and free internet. It provides seating a small amount of sleeping couches and a smoking room. Staff are very friendly. Lockers are available although you need to ask for a key at reception. Great value for money and a fantastic place to relax if you have a long transit (I am currently in lounge in a 7 hour transit (12am-7am). Warning no announcements are made in the lounge so keep an eye on your watch and check the screens in the lounge for boarding gates.,5,1
doha-airport,S Pratama,Indonesia,Generally it is a transit/transfer airport. Compared to many other airports it is standard during peak hours you hardly can move freely in the airport. The duty free is small with limited items available. For such a transit terminal it is not entertaining/accommodating enough. The toilets need improvement but still adequate. No trolleys available so you need to carry all of your cabin luggage when shopping in the duty free and the queue of the payment point could be a nightmare. Seats are often not enough during peak hours. Since they bussed everyone upon arrival and departure it was very time consuming. Really hope the New Doha International Airport can be operational soon.,5,0
doha-airport,D Kener,United States,First time visiting Doha and to be honest it is not very good. There is chaos probably as a result of over- staffing. The staff members walk around arbitrarily opening and closing lines resulting in large masses of people being moving around aimlessly. The bus transfers are long. Much easier to transit through European airports. Duty free on the first floor is pretty nice and there is a smaller duty free shop on the second floor.,6,0
doha-airport,R Ali,Bangladesh,Been at the transit terminal only. Any bigger and it probably would've been overbearing. Wide choice of duty-free products and cafes. Seating adequate sleeping room too small. Most washrooms are decent. Free internet and notebook for use - very handy given that skype is already installed. They update you with flight information regularly on the mic as well as the display board. Security a bit too tight but that's understandable.,9,1
doha-airport,Rosemary Eldousoky,Qatar,I live in Doha and use the airport frequently. The most common problem is the lack of seating or space for travellers. The departure queues are the least efficient but customer service is great at the counter. The problem we have experienced is knowing where to go for the check-in process but staff are very hands-on and get travellers in the right queue. Signage could be better. I never experienced any issues through security and immigration staff are wonderful. The food places located in the terminal are usually very busy with a lack of seats and there are lines for food. The currency exchange booth is generally busy. The baggage return is hot and cold. When I returned from Egypt we waited over an hour for the bags to be distributed. After an hour I went to the baggage office and complained because incoming flights after ours had received their bags. After I complained bags started to be distributed one-at-a-time. The smoking rooms are available and relatively clean with air vents. Restrooms were clean with service assistance available. The bus transits are long but usually very efficient. Cabs outside the airport are quickly available.,8,1
doha-airport,L Hall,South Africa,Had two long layovers at Doha both about 8 hours. Unfortunately we were not made aware of the Oryx lounge by our travel agent (I think we would have use it). We arrived at Doha to wait in long queues - they did however move quickly. The transfer to the terminal was very long on the 2nd leg. The transfer to the plane on the 1st leg was terrible (all shoved into a very small waiting room) and after about 20min doors were opened to allow us onto the buses - which we waited in with closed doors when we got to the plane. What is the point of a smoking room if everyone stands inside with the door open? Duty Free badly laid out on the one side - during peak times you cant move - a very strange mix of products. The food/outlets selection very limited. On the 2nd leg of our trip - we arrived at about 12pm (airport very busy) and sat down at a table - were told to move by a staff member who said he needed to clean. Roped the area off and left.,5,0
doha-airport,Mark Luddington,United Kingdom,First time visiting Doha and to be honest it was not as bad as I expected from the reviews. Transit terminal has plenty of staff and is clean and functional but toilets need a good clean did not use the food or duty free shop so cannot comment. The bus transfers should be described as a free tour of the airport new airport looks impressive and I hope that it opens soon.,9,0
doha-airport,O Mates,Luxembourg,Transfer via Doha en route from London to Dar-Es-Salaam. The airport wasn't quite as I would have expected. No air bridges to terminal all passengers disembarked onto buses which then went for a ride around the airport only to arrive a few hundred meters from the plane some 10 mins later. Security on arrival was efficient. Terminal building overcrowded with not enough seating. Shopping limited and pricey also they would only give change in local currency. Food choice not great and badly organised (you have to queue twice first to pay and then for the food). Toilets appalling. Wifi didn't seem to work. The new terminal is due to open soon which should change the picture. Until then an airport to be avoided if possible.,2,0
doha-airport,T Giz,Turkey,Flew to Beijing through Doha. 8 hours of stopover in Doha. The facilities are insufficient the biggest problem was the insufficient dirty toilets. The terminal building for transfers is small overcrowded and messy. Transfers from planes to the terminal buildings are done with shuttle buses they do not have bridge system connecting planes directly to the terminal building.,2,0
doha-airport,Peter Bedson,Oman,Getting better for Economy Class transit passengers as they now have most of the x-ray machines operating and better organisation meaning queues at peak times are bearable. Security staff are friendly and helpful. The terminal is still bursting at the seams though (and will be until the new airport is built) and it is often difficult to find a seat at peak times. The free wifi works - the guy at the QTEL booth is really helpful. Food is good but there is only a limited number of outlets. All the gates are bus gates and sometimes the transit is less than slick.,4,0
doha-airport,A Newton,United Kingdom,I must say I was surprised after reading the reviews. They seem to have the bus to and from the aircraft well organised. Plenty of seating not much in the way of food and what was there was fairly pricey. I'm sure the opening of the new airport can't come soon enough. However the airport was not the hell hole it's made out to be.,4,0
doha-airport,Dave Vern,Ireland,Good clean Airport. Customs and arrivals very overcrowded but plenty of seats to relax could do with a better choice of food.,4,0
doha-airport,T Neyrinck,Belgium,Transited through Qatar Airways Premium Terminal which is excellent. Calm airy relaxing excellent food plenty of staff boarding times announcements in good time. Only drawback is the very small and uninviting shopping outlet on the ground floor. And the long bus rides around the airport from/to the aircraft remain.,4,0
doha-airport,F Harvey,United Arab Emirates,This was the third time I've been to Doha airport. The check-in area and customs clearance were overcrowded. Once airside the airport was bursting to the seems due to Qatar Airway's success. There was a lack of decent restaurants and cafe outlets (serving healthier food). The free wi-fi they advertise and I had used 2x before was now unstable and I kept getting error messages. Not much else to do and not many spare seats or relaxing areas. The fact no planes pull up to gates mean annoying bus transits. I seriously hope the new airport will be much better and for the time being would advise flying via other regional airports such as Dubai Abu Dhabi or Muscat which have far superior airports.,1,0
doha-airport,R Benes,Jordan,Bus transfer from airplane to arrivals was quite standard. Transit is channelled through a few open security desks. My transit was around 7am - peak period. Overcrowded and limited duty free space limited choice of books/newspapers restrooms not acceptable standards and very low airconditioning. Oryx lounge 40 USD for entrance is not gift but at least you have a well airconditioned space with comfortable chairs space and high speed internet. Food availability was limited - around 11am they offer lunch service yet limited. If you have more than a couple of hrs transit time using the lounge could be a good solution. Departure procedures were standard although pre boarding was very unprofessional. Pax were squeezed in a small preboarding hall for 30 minutes then moved by bus to A320. The bus stood by the aircraft for other 20 mins with door closed before disembarking us. A little co-ordination between airplane and bus services would have helped.,3,0
doha-airport,T Neyrinck,Belgium,Very close to the city center which is nice. Immigration check-in security were very efficient and effortless when I arrived and left Doha. The Oryx lounge is good value for money ($40) in case you need to spend 2hrs+ in the terminal as there are very few shops and not much to see from the windows either. Duty free shopping not as much as in DXB but no long walking distances here either to the gates. Would compare DOH to AUH airport. Still the new Doha airport will be most welcome as a window to the world for Qatar. The first and last impressions a traveller gets is key! Even more important for transit pax.,3,0
doha-airport,P Bedson,Oman,Main terminal is way over capacity and there is not enough room for passengers with at peak times. You get a bus from the plane to the terminal and when you get to transit (the old arrivals hall) you are met with a sea of people trying to get into the terminal through security. There is supposed to be a system for short connections but the short connections line did not exist and they only call some people out of the line if their flight is closing. Tempers get frayed very quickly. Once through security if you have a short connection you need to run to your gate if you have time to kill there are not enough facilities. All this is planned to change with the new airport but at the moment Doha is a place to avoid in transit.,3,0
doha-airport,M Berger,Spain,The sooner the new terminal is built the better. The long bus transfers from/to some flights can mean the difference between successfully making a transfer connection or not with bags or without. I did make a very tight connection to Shanghai after arriving one hour late from Barcelona only to wait on the bus at the foot of the airstairs for 15 minutes along with 5 other buses! There needs to be better coordination between the staff in the Premium terminal and those at the aircraft to enable business and first class passengers to make the most of the great transfer facilities.,3,0
doha-airport,A Fury,United Kingdom,I had the misfortune of booking flights late and getting poor connection times. 8 hours outbound 13 hours inbound and they are clearly well over capacity. Transfers queues were long and frantic. Inside the lounge they have tried to improve catering facilities but food was poor. Toilets were appalling. How they have had such a deterioration since my last visit is beyond me.,1,0
doha-airport,R Eveleens,Netherlands,Coming in from Frankfurt around 1900 transfer was a nightmare for someone with tight connections. In the end it only took 45 minutes or so. Coming in from Bangkok around noon was a complete different story all security lanes open AND through in 30 seconds so we had 1 hour and 25 minutes to wait for the next plane. Outbound we had a long layover and I strongly recommend the Oryx lounge although it is a bit pricey for $40. In the general passenger area the toilets are not that clean they have an attendant in every room but since people washing themselves water is all over the place. Travel times by bus as mentioned in earlier comments are true outbound 15 mins from airplane to the terminal outbound it was just 2 minutes.,3,0
doha-airport,C Mangry,Australia,We traveled late 2010 and found our overall Doha airport experience to be terrific very pleasant and helpful staff and very clean airport. As we had a long layover we paid the $40 to use Oryx lounge this proved to be a good idea. Again good experience staff were helpful and multilingual. Food was fine and seating was ample. Even had a great floorshow provide by an angry and irrational man picking arguments with all and sundry. Perhaps he couldn't find the smoking room but the entertainment made the wait seem shorter. Would happily use Doha again.,5,0
doha-airport,Thomas Johnston,United Kingdom,Similar to my previous review as little has changed for transit passengers security and immigration process quite quick but this could depend on how many flights are arriving at the same time. Ground floor always seems to be crowded duty free shop poorly set out I've never been able to purchase anything here due to the long queues much better to use the smaller duty free shop on the upper floor. Plenty of seating available upstairs and as the seats have armrests it stops the backpackers lying full length still not somewhere you'd want to spend a long time. If you have along stopover there is the Oryx lounge $40 for 6 hours but before you pay check there is a Melbourne flight due to leave within the next 8 hours the rudest most inconsiderate people I've come across for a long time. All airport employees very pleasant and helpful.,4,0
doha-airport,A Khan,United Kingdom,Used Doha for my recent trip to India with Qatar small airport can get very crowded when multiple flights arrive but staff were pleasant and efficient and pointed to the right direction and spoke an array of different languages. Plenty of seating an okay duty free standard food court. My gripe with them is the bussing of passengers to the aircraft especially for flights for passengers for Asian destinations where the bus was overloaded and without airconditioning and waiting on the tarmac. Hopefully they will solve the problem with the New Doha Airport with airbridges.,4,0
doha-airport,Tony Fields,United Kingdom,I've used Doha 6 times since May major drawback is the bussing to and from the aircraft. Plus point is that there is ample seating. If you are flying into Doha as opposed to transiting the queues for immigration tend to be small. Duty free prices expensive service tends to be very slow. Food prices not as bad as they can be at other airports. It will be interesting to see whether they've addressed the minus points without ruining the plus points when they open the new terminal.,3,0
doha-airport,Paul Meerman,Netherlands,Visited two times during transfers. Both times no long lines quick through baggage check. From and to airplane long routes on buses. Airport is old but does for a short transfer. A smoking room available coffee shop eaterie and duty free shop (not cheap except cigarettes). Working people friendly. Overall a positive feeling but not a super airport.,3,0
doha-airport,S Byahut,Nepal,About 12 hr transit journey MAN-DOH-KTM. The queues for security checks on arrival could be better: there were lots of connecting passengers with very few (and very long) lines which could be improved. Transit area was great: good range of facilities (food toilets duty free shops to look around etc.) I had a great view of the runway from where I stayed. Wi-fi throughout the waiting areas could be a huge plus.,4,0
doha-airport,P Tanner,United Kingdom,Brief transfer en route Heathrow-Male around four hours to kill on return journey. Outbound involved boarding a bus on the far side round the perimeter road through security - seemed a bit cursory - upstairs to departure gate straight back downstairs onto bus and straight back to far side to join second plane. Easy to pass time on return plenty of seats and a great view of takeoffs and landings. This time the flights arrived and left from the terminal side. Duty-free very expensive but you don't have to use it - it's an air terminal with a few shops not a ghastly mall like Heathrow or Sydney. Piers would be nice given blistering outdoor temperatures but that's academic as a new airport is being built.,3,0
doha-airport,Bill Atkins,United States,A mixed experience. Arrival very easy and quick. Departure rather stressful. Have to fight through crowds lines for check-in passport control rather confusing and disorganized as was security and not convinced how serious it was - there is secondary gate screening which is good. In the main terminal one shared lounge (except for Qatar Airways) as far as I could see and a couple of places to eat.,3,0
doha-airport,Paul Rex,United Kingdom,My family had 4 hours plus between flights so we paid $40/head to use the Oryx lounge. This covers food and drinks (including alcohol on request) WiFi and showers. Not the greatest lounge ever but very friendly staff on the reception desk and quite a useful base for a long transit time.,4,0
doha-airport,E Connor,Spain,After reading reviews here we were slightly concerned even though it was only a 2 hour stop over. We need not have worried at all. Security was quick and easy with efficient staff who pointed us in the correct direction for transit. After our flight from LHR we wanted to freshen up and found the toilets very clean with large cubicles and plenty of paper towels. Duty free was expensive but there is a smaller shop on the 1st floor were you could buy small gifts books papers soft drinksetc at good prices. Next door was a Costa Coffee and we enjoyed a nice coffee for a similar price to Europe so we had no argument there. Didn't use the food court area but it looked okay nothing fancy and not much choice but was serving it's purpose. All in all it was an okay small airport which was very clean and comfortable my only one annoyance was the gentleman on our boarding gate who stopped nearly every non-white person who passed to check their details. He was so rude and patronising to a British born Indian lady in front of us it was embarrassing for her. Thankfully she kept her cool and dignity which showed him up. If this is normal for the male staff in Qatar then it's a real shame but something for people to be aware of.,4,0
doha-airport,Robert Szocik,United Kingdom,Transiting to/from HKG. Huge queues at security due to constant landing of widebody aircraft but it never took longer than 15 minutes to clear security as plenty of staff and scanners are available. Never imagined an airport could be so crowded at 2am. The terminal is too small considering how busy this airport is becoming but this has the benefit that all the gates can be reached 2-3 minutes after security. Passports are only checked at the boarding gates. Facilities are limited (ground floor duty free area a few restaurants and small shops upstairs) so a long layover would be dull but enough for a 2-3 hour wait. Plenty of seats everywhere. Toilets inadequate - the cleaners do try but can't seem to keep up due to the volume of pax. No air bridges so a long bus journey to/from the plane seems usual. Efficient polite English-speaking staff throughout. Cheapest bottled water I have ever seen at an airport - Â£0.33 GBP! A nice place to transit if you have a short layover I will try and use DOH on future transits to Asia.,5,0
doha-airport,Tom Johnston,United Kingdom,Doha airport is on the small side for the numbers of flights Qatar are running. I arrived from Manchester on route to Bangkok early evening to the usual long lines at security - which to be fair do seem to quite efficient. Main terminal is compact to say the least lower floor crowded duty free area badly set out almost impossible to walk around at time without knocking something off the displays with your bags - long queues to pay I gave up and went to the second floor which is much better with plenty of seats. As I had an eight and a half hour stopover on both outwards and return flights I pre-booked into the Onyx lounge - this is situated on the second floor and quite nice - quiet with plenty of seats a small internet corner. In the main area there are TVs newspapers and magazines but only of local interest. A small food area is nicely set out selection of food a little disappointing although its plentiful you can help yourself to tea coffee and soft drinks as often as you want. The cost in $40.00 but if you are only in Doha for a short time its not worth paying . Check in is very good in Doha as it was on all parts of the trip Qatar staff are excellent and went out of their way to book me into an exit row seat due to my height. I believe the new airport will open in 2012.,4,0
doha-airport,R Voisin,France,Long stopovers both ways in DOH - 5.5 and 4.5 hours. Limited choice and low quality of food and drink if you have no lounge access. Childrens play area was closed and looked in a bad state of repair. Toilets in sufficient supply but not very inviting. Boarding announcements nonstop and very loud - airport was cold buses were even colder. Bus ride and waiting time at the aircraft was unbearable on both trips. On the return leg we remained 35 minutes in front of the aircraft before being allowed onboard. As a result we saw the baggage handlers for our flight throwing violently all suitcases on the tarmac prior to loading - not what you would expect. Transfer and security were efficient. If you have a short transfer in DOH it may be okay. For longer stopovers wait until the airport has been re-vamped or take warm clothing and aspirins.,2,0
doha-airport,Michael Davies,United Kingdom,Arrived at 18.30 from Manchester to connect with a flight to Dubai. Like many others we were on a remote stand and a bus journey longer than average. However it did mean that you were dropped right by the Immigration desks and transit section. So you didn't have to walk far. Transit processing very quick and I was in the departure lounge 5 minutes after getting off the bus. Doha Airport is small which means that all the departure gates are within the same area - no walking miles. Duty free shop small size good choice of usual items but a bit chaotic due to lots of people. Prices same as other international airports. The food court was small and also chaotic - food below average so dont rely on this! Nowhere to get a beer. My lay over was only 80 minutes but this soon passed as boarding for my onward flight started 50 minutes early due to the plane being on a remote stand. The experience on the return journey was very similar. For both flights we were ready to depart well before scheduled time. Doha airport is very efficient although I wouldn't want to have to stay there for a long time as facilities are limited.,4,0
doha-airport,C van der Walt,China,I had a stop in Doha on my way from Shanghai to Johannesburg and back. The duty free was overcrowded and toilets dirty - there was enough seating thoug. No real restaurant to sit down and have a snack or a drink (the food court was full). The airport is reaching full capacity now and I hope they will open the new Doha airport soon.,3,0
doha-airport,Yves Roux,France,Good airport. Easy to go to check-in and moving in the airport - not too big. The bad thing is the way to go to plane using small bus that take 20min to go to the plane. The road of the bus is to go all around the airport: a bit long.,4,0
doha-airport,N Weeden,,I have passed through Doha twice as a stopover to Bangkok. Doha is a great airport if you don't have too long between flights. But on my last trip the stopover was eleven hours. I found all staff very helpful and friendly yet professional. Plenty of space to sit down and relax. My one criticism (and I do realise Qatar is a Muslim country) Doha is an International airport and needs a good 'sit down' restaurant (not a take-away) and a bar for travellers. Having said that I look forward to more visits as I found Qatar Airways the best airline that I have flown with.,4,0
doha-airport,Martin Brown,,"I got here early as I thought my Amex Card gave me access to a lounge however only Amex issued in the Middle East can have access so found myself with 2 hours of walking round. When I arrived the queue for the baggage screening was short so was straight in checkin was fast immigration was not so fast and final security check was okay as the immigration lines were throttling the amount of people trying to get through. Once inside you go straight into the duty free area of which there were plenty of cigarettes but everything else seemed to be lacking for example the only decent champagne was a '98 Dom Perignon everything else was Moet or less. To be honest they did have everything you could want i.e. electronics Mont Blanc Hugo Boss etc but the range they had of each was limited and expensive compared to UK High Street prices. There were a few shops on the upper level but the main shopping was a large single shop on the lower level. Food was also limited no restaurants just 2 food courts at separate ends of the terminal both were very busy until gone midnight then they were almost deserted. Opposite the far food court was a small childrens play area. One thing you could find plenty of was toilets and smoking rooms however some of these are 'hidden' so most people crammed into the smaller easily accessible rooms whereas the larger rooms were empty. At the far end of the terminal were a mosque and next to it a quiet room. The quiet room has very comfy chairs but none were free so a few people were sleeping in the mosque despite the sign ""No sleeping in the mosque"". On a previous visit here I was with BA and had lounge access this makes the airport a much better place to be. Unless you have lounge access this airport is okay for short transits and if you don't have long to wait for your flight but if you are there for more than an hour you may get a little bored.",3,0
doha-airport,Andrew Stuckles,,I had 1 hour 20 minutes to make a connection. You have to go through security which is the long line when you first get off bus into arrivals lounge. It will take about 20-30 minutes to get through. They were quick to get passengers through. Behind it you will find lot's of stores and boutiques. Bathrooms were clean and efficient. If you're a smoker they have a smoking room. I made my flight with 20 minutes to spare.,5,0
doha-airport,Alan Ho,,Used the airport 1 week ago as a part of my flight from Singapore to Athens via Doha. A small airport with all the basic facilities you would need for a short transit but if your transit time is long bring along a good book as you might not have much things to do here.,4,0
doha-airport,Ian Jenkins,,Aircraft parked remotely and everyone has to be bussed to terminal. Long line at security check but reasonably well organised. Terminal itself is rather boring and announcements too loud. Layovers tend to be long (3-5 hours). Food counters only seem to offer fast food. Coffee expensive (9GBP for 2 coffees!). Toilets overrun at certain times,2,0
doha-airport,S Wood,,Qatar Airways transit arrangements (MXP-DOH-BKK) were first class very quick (5-10 mins once your bus arrived at the terminal) and hassle free even with kids. Economy terminal is really quite nice perfectly adequate and there is a super play area for kids at gate 16.,4,0
doha-airport,S Pathirana,,I have passed through this airport about 20 times in the past few years I use Economy hence don't get the privilege of accessing the Premium Terminal. Transfer lines just to scan your bag can take up to 45 minutes. The transfer section needs to be thought through given the expansion of Qatar Airways. Staff are either friendly and clueless or just unfriendly. Toilets are disgusting. Very limited food and duty-free options. I'm glad that a new airport is coming up as this airport does not too Qatar Airways' reputation any justice.,2,0
doha-airport,I Pattison,,Just used Doha airport to and from Cebu. Airport is very clean plenty of comfortable seating and toilets. Did not use any of the eating facilities as stay was not long. Only criticism is the chaos getting through the transfer x-rays 2000+ people desperate to get through for flights which had announced last calls more staff stopping queue jumping would have helped.,5,0
doha-airport,Sahar Choudhury,,Clean small modern airport fantastic for transfers and staff are helpful. Plenty of seating space on the 1st floor but ground floor gates were crowded. Go upstairs and sit. There is a Starbucks on 1st floor at one end and accepts dollars and British pounds and the staff speak English. Change returned will be in Qatari dinars. On the other end of the floor is a restaurant but I did not use it. As someone commented below the toilets aren't as clean as the airport. But I found some clean toilets near the Starbucks hidden away - just ask the Starbucks staff for the nearest toilets. I prefer Doha Airport over Dubai because of ample space and peace and quiet and easy transfers.,5,0
doha-airport,I Pattison,,Very clean airport fairly limited shops but adequate for short transfer stops. Plenty of seating. Departures can be a bit chaotic. Staff very helpful.,5,0
doha-airport,Yasir Iqbal,,Since Feb 2006 I travel very often between Berlin to Karachi/Islamabad (TXL to KHI/ISB) and I find this airport very different from 2005 it has improved surprisingly. As I am privilege club member I am guest in Gold lounge which is very comfortable place to be. If I have more than half an hour between flights it is usual that I take a shower some food and tea before my next flight. This airport has all wonderful except its security screening machines where queues are very long and in summer it can be very huge.,5,0
doha-airport,Jon Marshall,,Stopped on transit to Abu Dhabi. Small but well laid out airport with plenty of seats. Bus transfers are a pain but unavoidable at the moment. No problem with the gents toilets on my visit but my wife said the floors were wet in the ladies toilets. Overall good experience.,4,0
doha-airport,S Thew,,For our morning arrival the airport was not at all crowded. For a mother of three most important of all it held a really nice play area. The area included a climbing and sliding area which is really helpful when working off all that stored energy from a long-haul flight. Better than expected.,4,0
doncaster-sheffield-airport,D Grasby,United Kingdom,We flew from here for our summer holiday. The most stress free experience of an airport I have had. Car park cheap and next to the entrance. Excellent location. Staff very helpful. Very clean spacious and great facilities.,10,1
doncaster-sheffield-airport,C Stephenson,United Kingdom,I've used the airport several times this year and on a Monday morning it's an incredibly quiet place. Generally it's not bad although we were locked into arrivals by mistake on one occasion. It's like a smaller version of Liverpool airport and suffers from the same atmosphere. Signs warning the approaching motorist of dire consequences should they not comply with a list of regulations serve as a welcome. Then one is charged to use the drop-off zone even though a few yards away you can park for free for 15 minutes. The 15-minute rule both here and in the drop-off zone adds a little extra inconvenience to the experience as it makes it difficult to be met by a partner with a car (they may be obliged to drive around the airport for a while if your plane is late). Then we are regaled inside the terminal by loud warnings about wheel-clamping. With about a dozen customers inside this seems less than helpful to the ambience.,5,1
doncaster-sheffield-airport,Tony Hook,United Kingdom,Very disappointing treatment by arrogant security staff. Not an airport I would happily use again. Great shame for other hard working staff working there but my experience colours a disappointing experience.,,0
doncaster-sheffield-airport,D Brushwood,United Kingdom,Very small airport but as we arrived early we checked in and got through security very quickly. Staff arranged for us to pre-board as my son is autistic. Just 2 small shops and wetherspoons cafe/bar. Would use again.,8,1
doncaster-sheffield-airport,J King,United Kingdom,Flew from Doncaster and planning to do so again. The airport is small and basic but to be honest we checked in late to save boredom and everything was ok. The WHSmith could do with being a little bit bigger as it can get a little crowded the Wetherspoons restaurant is probably the best feature. Basic bathroom facilities but all fit for purpose. Would be nice to see the airport expand a little but I guess that comes with more flights. Overall it was a pleasant enough experience coupled with the fact it only took us 20 mins to get home after baggage collection on return. If you can fly out of Doncaster id say support it as much as possible. Another plus about Doncaster was parking right outside the terminal major plus after any flight. They have a play area for kids which a nice touch and thoughtful never seen one of these even in the best of airports so 10 points to them. Id say Doncaster is a clean stress free airport with decent staff and a basic selection of things to do. One other plus point is that the run way is ready to take the big flights just need to wait on demand.,7,1
doncaster-sheffield-airport,A Cutler,United Kingdom,The airport simply cannot cope with any significant number of passengers - and I am only talking about two plane loads here. Be warned that once through security the only food outlet is a far too small Wetherspoons - and there aren't enough tables to cope with the customers let alone the frazzled bar staff trying to take food orders. Expect the queue of hungry customers to snake all round the departure lounge getting increasingly annoyed that they won't get fed in time or won't have anywhere to eat their food even if it does arrive in time before boarding.,4,0
doncaster-sheffield-airport,Anthony Verondia,United Kingdom,Fantastic airport to use. Reasonably easy to find. Car parking is a joy found a space and was inside the terminal in 2 mins. Building bright and clean and all staff were pleasant and friendly including at security!. Departure lounge was roomy with a great view overlooking the runway. If shopping before a flight is your thing there is not a great deal to satisfy your needs. Both out and return flights were on time and I was out of the airport and in my car 20mins after landing. Normally use the nightmare called Leeds/Bradford where you are treated and herded like cattle most of the time.,9,1
doncaster-sheffield-airport,A Winter,United Kingdom,If coming down A1 do not follow signs via M18 - this takes you miles round outskirts of Doncaster. Continue to J4 then through Bawtry much easier and less hassle. At airport no sign at first roundabout for Premium car park so got in ordinary one instead. When did find right car park it was full. Airport website says 45 mins from York - this is wildly optimistic - allow at least extra half hour.,3,0
doncaster-sheffield-airport,C Fordham,,The airport is well designed easy to navigate and hassle free once you are there. The lack of I found travelling to and from Doncaster airport a frustrating and not a particularly pleasant experience. A very out of the way place needing an expensive taxi ride from Doncaster main line station to get there. Very few shops and little to do whilst waiting for the flight. Poor refreshment area and even worse food. No walkway from the plane needing a treacherous walk across the tarmac in icy conditions Arriving from Tenerife late at night we had to queue outside in freezing conditions whist waiting to go through passport control. Many passengers had babies and young children. I certainly would not rush to use the airport again.,2,0
doncaster-sheffield-airport,A Devine,,The airport is well designed easy to navigate and hassle free once you are there. The lack of public transport direct to Sheffield is a major flaw though. This needs to be sorted out quickly because I am aware of many people using other airports with direct links for this reason.,3,0
doncaster-sheffield-airport,S Porter,,A very easy-to-use airport. My only complaint is that if you have any small (less than 100ml) liquids to take through in your hand luggage they charge you for a clear plastic bag out of the vending machine whereas most other airports provide them free. Beware of this and take your own clear re-sealable freezer bag.,5,0
doncaster-sheffield-airport,P Sloan,,The parking is excellent approx £7 a day is good value very close to the terminal. The building itself is light lots of glass and steel. Booking in is the usual speedy process. The departure area is spacious and easy to navigate. The issue I have is the security check when you have a couple of flights going out at the same time security can get overwhelmed and you get the feeling your going to miss your flight but you just scrape it. Rest is easy. Baggage reclaim is fast.,5,0
doncaster-sheffield-airport,Chris Hallam,,Doncaster airport is a half sized replica of Liverpool Airport also owned by Peel Holdings. On the whole the airport is spacious not crowded and pleasant staff. Check in generally quick as is baggage reclaim. Passport control on return can take a while as usually only two officials are allocated to checking passports. Two things to beware of - if you have a flight in the evening buy sandwiches before going through security as quite often Wetherspoons airside will close as early as 5.00 pm leaving only one bar open with a very limited selection of snacks. Secondly be very careful about using credit cards in the parking payment machines in the airport. I used my credit card to pay for 15 mins parking which should have cost 3 pounds when the credit card bill arrived the machine had charged me over 300 pounds! This apparently was due to a fault on the machine but it took several months and threats of going to the press to recover it all. Despite these minor flaws Doncaster Sheffield airport is a pleasant under-used provincial airport which although a little isolated is a pleasant change from the crowds of Heathrow or Gatwick.,4,0
doncaster-sheffield-airport,C Miller,,Spacious and efficient terminal with good cafes bars & shopsthough the lack of a cashpoint that doesn't charge an extra fee is disappointing. Main problem though is onward transport. Unless a direct bus or train route to Sheffield is created soon they really should remove the city name from the airport.,3,0
doncaster-sheffield-airport,Tim Hall,,What a pleasant experience this airport is. Flight departed around lunchtime on monday loads of seats in departure lounge free no queues in Duty Free or at bar! Although Leeds /Bradford is my local airport the terminal there is struggling to cope with increased passenger levels. I would fly from DSA in the future.,5,0
doncaster-sheffield-airport,Dave Wharton,,Flew to Pisa with Ryanair. Flight takes off early morning and the airport was empty at that time (07:30) we were the only people checking in beats Manchester and foggy Leeds Bradford. Nice and small no car park shuttle bus rubbish. Car park easy to navigate short walk to the terminal few check in desks - not hard to find yours thoroughly pleasant.,,0
doncaster-sheffield-airport,Martin Wylie,,Must add that the public transport links are not the best. Currently the only public transport is a shuttle bus to Doncaster station from where you need to take the train if you want to go to Sheffield. The fastest train is 15 mins but others take around 35. There are also taxis at the airport although a taxi into Sheffield will be around 35 pounds. They can be difficult to come by at night.,,0
doncaster-sheffield-airport,Peter Hills,,Very easy new airport to use. I have so far used it four times in it's opening year. It's pretty much an exact replica of Liverpool John Lennon Airport and is spacious and well laid out. Going through the airport couldn't be simpler or easier. Staff are pleasant and are always visible and approachable. There is a great landside bar which has a full view of the airfield. Baggage reclaim takes 10-15 minutes at the most as there are not too many flights at the airport at the moment.,,0
donetsk-airport,Yevheniy Kahanovych,Ukraine,Finally the new terminal is in operation. Arrival and departure were a breeze no queues no trouble with signage nothing to complain about. Toilets are clean overall facility is still under final touches of construction. The terminal is too big for the amount of flights served so very few people there. Pity they have no food and drink outlets landside yet and just a small stall with snacks airside. Overall impression very good everything worked there and up to the international standards. From plane to taxi in 5 minutes from check in to plane in 10. Good.,6,1
donetsk-airport,Janne Petersson,Sweden,"Arrived from Kiev rather late in evening. This airport is still very Soviet in many ways eg. it has very bad apron and terminal lighting and baggage claim is directly from luggage carts which can cause confusion if two flights arrive simultaneously (but don't worry the friendly airport security guys are there to help screaming at you in Russian when they suspect you walk toward the wrong cart). Other facilities also seem very basic and/or outdated and there is absolutely no information about transport to the city centre (not even a timetable!) so you may unfortunately find the unofficial ""taxi"" drivers your only alternative for going downtown. To be honest one of them gave me a very fair price and even gave me change upon arrival but I do not recommend ""inexperienced"" travellers to use these guys! All in all I found the city's rail station a much more civilized place than the airport.",2,0
dortmund-airport,Eelco van den Heuvel,Netherlands,Small and easy to reach and navigate. Lots of parking space which is reasonably priced. Food and drink opportunities mediocre especially airside. Paying one euro for the shuttlebus to the parking lots is ridiculous. Time consuming when everybody has to purchase a ticket on a full bus. Paying for Internet (€3/hour) is a rip-off since most airports offer free wifi. But all in all a good airport.,8,1
dortmund-airport,H Oberbeckmann,Germany,Small airport with short ways. Sometimes there can be queues. but there's everything you need restaurants cafe enough check-in desks visitors terrace for free and several travel agencies. The airport shuttles from the next train stations could be cheaper or free.,8,1
dortmund-airport,Karl Riedl,,Small and nice airport located close to Dortmund. However if like short ways and fast service this airport will convince you.,4,0
dortmund-airport,P Adams,,Great airport I hope too many other travellers don't discover it for a while. Have used DTM a few times in the last year and it's quick and easy to use for both arrivals and departures. Security is very quick with lots of staff on hand and although airside facilities are a little limited it's not an issue as you don't need to spend much time there. Arriving is a breeze I'm always off the plane and leaving with my luggage within 10-15 mins. If only other airports were as efficient and pleasant to use.,4,0
dortmund-airport,Rolf Heelas,,As mentioned below a functional regional airport. appears very new. compared to UK airports underused. Fairly quick passport control and luggage already out on the belt meaning out of the airport in less than 15 minutes after getting off the plane. Flying out found the viewing deck (found by chance) was good apart from the lack of aircraft flying to view! Airside there is not much and what is there is hidden if you turn left after security go to the end of hall and turn left there is a bar/cafe area and duty free place. If your turn right at security for easyjet flights there is a tiny dutyfree shop and further along past passport checks a tiny stand selling coffee and drinks. All in all a good functional airport.,,0
dortmund-airport,M Talbot,,Nice small to medium sized airport serving low cost airlines. Travelled through Dortmund airport while on route from England to Poland over Christmas and New Year. Arrived with Easyjet and had to check in for a Wizzair flight. 2 Hours difference between arrivals and departure times. Arrived cleared passport control picked up luggage checked in for next flight cleared security and was at departure gate all inside of 40 minutes! Fantastic. Return through Dortmund was just as pleasant. Facilities are good enough for short stays and there is a nice quiet cafe on the arrivals floor. Not bad at all.,,0
dortmund-airport,C Hesse,,Decent airport serving as one of Easyjet's German hubs as mentioned before. In addition services to most major hubs and cities on offer. Strong in Polish flights with several cities direct on offer. Terminal facilities adequate terminal modern and appropriate for current passenger figures. Future may require terminal expansion.,,0
dortmund-airport,Mark Evans,,"DTM is now gaining a higher profile as easyJet's northern German hub. DTM can be compared directly with easyJet's UK counterpart - Luton (LTN). Both can be described as ""engineers' airports"". There is an absence of architectural flourishes and each is strictly functional. DTM in fact does a good job at present although pressure points may build up as traffic levels increase e.g. at the airside bar area. The Dortmund Flughaven website omits any mention of public transport connections to the city. There are two options. A dedicated express bus service to the Hauptbahnhof costs EUR5 one-way and takes some 20-25 minutes. It is generally an hourly service although there is a two-hour gap between 15.30 and 17.30 on the return Hauptbahnhof-Flughaven timetable. An alternative way is to take the free shuttle bus to the nearby Holzwickede DB station from where there is a circuitous twice-hourly service to Hauptbahnof. The one-way fare is EUR 1.80. End-to-end journey time is around 25-30 minutes.",,0
douala-airport,Mark Bickerton,,I flew into Douala on Swiss and departed on Virgin Nigeria. Both experiences were quite pleasant. I had only hand luggage and was in and out of the airport quite quickly. When departing we waited at the gate which was quite calm and cool. Yes its a bit manic as you walk out of the airport with people and noise everywhere but lots of places are like that. If you know where you are going or have someone to meet you its fine.,3,0
douala-airport,H Jackson,,Not much has changed in this airport built a 30+ years ago. The outside is decrepit. Security is virtually non existent. Touts were able to penetrate the immigration arrival area where apparently for a fee they assist arriving passengers with the immigration forms. I witnessed this with a group of Chinese arrivals. More touts swarm you in the baggage arrival area where you are also hustled to part with cash in order that they may assist you through customs. Everybodys luggage is supposed to be searched before exit but I think this is more of a money grab. The whole experience can be very unsettling to the western traveller. Exit was not much better. The airport staff often try to extort money for hand luggage with limits set at 7kg. A small bribe will get you past this nuisance. I forgot to pay airport tax before getting to the immigration counter so the immigration officer graciously offered to collect it for me. From my hands it went straight to her left pocket! Duty free is rather limited. A few arts and crafts stands some selling local music cds/ dvds local tea coffee and some snacks. An airport to avoid even by African standards. Security screening is performed by the airlines themselves. The only place where I was not hassled by money was in the toilet. No way I can foresee the FAA approving direct flights to the US from this airport.,1,0
dresden-airport,David Griffiths,,Pleasant and unmemorable for all the right reasons - no excessive queues no overcrowding just a good efficient airport doing what airports are meant to do ie. processing passengers swiftly and without hassle in an attractive environment. Some parts of DRS particularly the LH check in reminded me of a smaller version of HAM. I agree with Mr Evans that DRS is under-utilised although at least that means there is plenty of space for everyone.,4,0
dresden-airport,Mark Evans,,Little expense has been spared to make DRS a spacious and state-of-the- art. An all-round highly agreeable experience with the added advantage of DRS being very close to the city centre. A half-hourly rail service connects DRS with Dresden Hautbahnof (a 25-minute journey) with several intermediate stops all for a princely EUR 1.80 one-way fare. BA has recently launched an LGW-DRS service (great views of the heart of the city on the landing approach from the starboard side) but the airport remains somewhat under-utilised.,4,0
dubai-airport,A Müller,Germany,"Every time I travel through Dubai it gets worse. They don't have Wifi anymore, there is only Boingo, which offers 30 minutes (sometimes 60) of free Wifi but in 9 out of 10 times it breaks after about 5 minutes, telling you you have already used up your minutes. If you purchase more, you frequently have to re-login which requires you to check your email, but you have no internet to do that, so your purchase is useless. The newest invention is a security theater for transit passengers to make sure you didn't purchase a bomb or gun in a duty-free shop on your incoming flight. This leads to long queues where you can spend more than an hour, so if your stopover is less than two hours, don't even bother to go to a lounge or anything.",2,0
dubai-airport,Ian Chow,Singapore,A transit airport so one would expect a lot of travelers lounging and sleeping. There's too many passengers transiting between Asia and Europe so there's not enough seats to go around. Airport staff were helpful but not friendly (would not go the extra mile and sometimes seem unapproachable). Not many facilities other than some F&B and shopping outlets. Wifi not working - I was kicked out of the service every few minute or so - probably due to overcrowding at the airport.,10,0
dubai-airport,W Blades,Australia,"Travelling with a children at this airport is a complete nightmare, in particular transfers from one terminal to another, and or attempting to collect bags and exit the airport. It's just too big, heavily congested, and difficult to navigate. The terminals are so far apart, a transfer from Terminal 1 to Terminal 3 can take anything from 30 to 60 minutes depending on crowds and boarding gates. The arrivals hall to pass through customs took us 1 hour 50 minutes, that was on top of the 30 minute hike by foot and metro rail just to get there. I normally use the Emirates lounge facilities, however had the misfortune to use the public toilets inside the terminal, it was an absolute disgrace. I won't go into the details, but the floors looked like a herd of camels had relieved themselves on the floor. General airport cleanliness was below standard for such a new modern airport, but in fairness, given how many people utilise the airport facilities it would be a nightmare to try and keep clean. Duty free shopping is very expensive when compared to similar large airports throughout the world.",1,0
dubai-airport,Ludwik Zabłocki,Poland,"I was transfering there in Feb and arrived an departed in July. Dubai is very modern and clean airport. Terminal 3 was  where I was traveling. It is huge, maybe even too big. I was very upset with ""duty free"" prices. I asked myself few times if I`m really hungry. Fortunately I was given a free-meal coupon due to few-hour overstay. I read lots of satisfied opinions about this airport, so I expected a lot. Maybe that was a mistake. It is high-standard, but nothing was really outstanding, just good quality.",9,1
dubai-airport,A Shanmugasundaram,Italy,"It was a 7 hour transit and they had only 4-5 charging stations which were completely occupied. After hours I found myself a spot to charge my devices but then came the next trouble where the wifi connectivity was so bad and it took several minutes just to log in! After completing my work in sometime I went through the duty free shops which had the usual stuff with no big price difference than other airports. The number of restaurants are good but if you want still want to find out more options you must switch terminals to look for some more restaurants which is really tiring. The only good thing is that staff are friendly to assist, but the infrastructure and the facilities must be developed.",5,0
dubai-airport,Nur Afiqah Rahmat,United Arab Emirates,"I flew in 4 times to this airport within the last 2 weeks, 3 arrivals and 1 departure. Flew in to Terminal 1 where all the other airlines land at. Now this is a review for Terminal 1. This greatly varies to Terminal 3, where all the Emirates flight flies into (which is the posher terminal). Absolutely amazed at how bad the condition of the terminal is, considering this is a main hub for tourists and that this is Dubai. My flight from Muscat to Dubai was only 45-50 minutes long however the queue at the immigration? 1 hour 10 minutes - longer than my flight. The immigration was jam packed. Regardless the day or the time! I flew in on a Thursday afternoon (4pm): Packed. I flew in on a Monday morning (11am): Packed. I flew back in on Wednesday (12am): Packed. Oh and not to mention, it was boiling! I don't know if the staff noticed just how packed it was, but they certainly did not notice just how the amount of people equals to more body heat. Considering that is is Dubai, they can honestly do better. Because of all these queuing, I have decided to only fly to Abu Dhabi whenever I need to get to UAE again (unless I'm flying via Emirates).",1,0
dubai-airport,Janey Buckley,Australia,"I was in transit at Dubai this time. No more impressed with the airport than I was last time.

I could not get any connection all night. I wanted to talk to my family but with calling cards I had to spend at least 30 dollars. That too I had to exchange my USD to local money first. Ground staff were very unresponsive and not willing to help. I travel frequently but this time I made a terrible mistake choosing Dubai for my connecting flight. All said, never again.",1,0
dubai-airport,David Hawke,United Arab Emirates,Very long queues for check in immigration and security. The staff had no idea how to arrange the people. I actually felt unsafe because it felt as though there was going to be a crush there. This is the worst I have ever seen Dubai T1.,,0
dubai-airport,Zinnia Clark,United Kingdom,It's been a long time since I last had to transit through Dubai and the trauma of trying to rush through and not miss our connecting flight is almost a distant memory and I hoped as we were flying to stay in Dubai it would be less irksome this time. Whilst the queuing was not too bad staff were certainly not friendly at immigration either in or out. The facilities in terminal 1 were limited and there was hardly any seating for once we had checked in our return flight. However the main problem was that everything was filthy. The toilets smelt and were extremely hot. The floor was sopping wet due to the shower heads in the loos. Even the few seats available in the terminal were dirty I perched on the edge they were so bad. I would have sat in Costa or Starbucks but they were small hemmed in and packed with other disconsolate souls looking for a seat. Couldn't access the wifi either and power sockets were no where to be found. Duty free was expensive and not well laid out. Lots of construction work going on seemed to have to walk for miles. It seems to me the infrastructure and staff attitude are not up to it Dubai just isn't a mature enough destination to act as a truly international hub.,2,0
dubai-airport,C Smith,Australia,For any future travellers - do not expect to purchase breakfast at the airport. Extremely difficult to get a cup of decent coffee and even more difficult to find a place to serve breakfast. We had to make do with a greasy burger and a soda! For an international airport not to have decent restaurants in their departure lounge is appalling in this day and age. Eat before you arrive!,7,1

dubai-airport,Will de Jager,Netherlands,"Twice a year I am flying into Dubai International Airport Terminal 3 and things are getting worse. The queues at immigration seem to grow and the immigration officials are getting more indifferent every time I land at the airport. They take their time and spend more time chatting with colleagues and in mobile telephone conversations than in stamping passports. Most of the time a simple good morning or even a friendly nod is to much to ask for. Incoming flights are getting delayed by the endless circles planes have to make over the Persian Gulf before finally being able to land and outgoing flights are regularly delayed by 30 to 60 minutes even if everyone is onboard and the doors are shut. The message from the captain is always the same: ""Due to the fact that it is an extremely busy time air traffic control has asked us to wait because there is no space on the runway."" This doesn't change no matter what time of day you are flying. Emirates must be the most delayed airliner in the world. There is clearly a capacity problem at Dubai International leading to massive delays every time. I love to fly Emirates especially the A-380 but if this problem isn't solved I will choose another company for my future travels just to avoid Dubai International Airport.",2,0
dubai-airport,N Seales,United Kingdom,Can describe DXB in one word - dreadful. Business class passenger transiting from LHR to SIN and the whole experience was appalling with transit taking almost 2.5 hours. Staff surly and quite frankly useless. First time flying Emirates and will be the last despite faultless service on both legs of the journey but I simply could not tolerate the DXB experience any time soon.,,0
dubai-airport,A Iborra,United Arab Emirates,I fly to/from DXB regularly. The queues at immigration are the longest and worst regulated I have seen and I visited over 50 countries. I currently hold an e-gate pass to avoid this problem but before than that I had to wait an average of 2-3h every time I arrived to Dubai. Sometimes the staff modify the queues and people that arrived hours after you pass in front of you and you can't speak with them as they are inattentive and rude. The immigration officers are extremely relaxed and not concerned abut the situation and several times I have seen them using their cell phones while they work.,2,0
dubai-airport,Bulent Narbay,United Arab Emirates,Terrible passport control services in Teminal-1. We waited almost 1.5 hours to pass through the passport control. They simply make people suffer. We travelled to HK and Tokyo before arriving to Dubai. There were more passengers at those airports but finished passport control so quickly but Dubai airport is simply miserable. I think they just focus on improving Terminal 3 for Emirates Airlines but ignore Terminal 1 and 2 which are in a bad condition. Our luggage belt was not known when we got out we just found our luggage on the floor somewhere near luggage bands. Outside the building was worse. Lots of people but a very narrow sidewalk - big mess!,3,0
dubai-airport,Edward York,United Kingdom,All in all the best parts are the shopping and the Emirates Lounges. The worst parts are the wait at immigration the long walks from the gates to the baggage hall and the signage hassle when you need to change your ticket.,7,1
dubai-airport,Antoine van der Wielen,Netherlands,Airport was not to be compared with the 5 star airports like Hong Kong or Singapore. You get 30 minutes of free wifi yet if you clear your cache memory of your device you get another 30 minutes and so I had 7 hours of internet. It takes 1 minute to register not so difficult. It was adequate for transfer.,6,1
dubai-airport,C Birks,United Kingdom,Agree with some comments here - avoid transit of less than 2 hours like the plague - it's stressful at the best of times. Singapore to Dubai / Manchester in middle of night (when I think it is busiest at DXB) stacked then 20 mins on buses to terminal - don't sit at back of A380 otherwise you will be on 4th or 5th bus (if you are economy) long queue for further security train to other side of terminal - generally leaves you with 15 minutes spare. For a huge airport toilets are lacking with big queues - top tip go onboard before getting off and avoid that situation. Seats lacking - tip is sit on floor or pay for lounge. Other than that folks it's ok for breaking up journey for East to west west to East with good range of flights going in for that reason I will keep using.,5,1
dubai-airport,Rahul Mullick,India,Please activate the Fast Track cards. They are pointless to have if you don't have separate Fast Track queues. The queues are a mess. We were lucky to have enough time between transfers else we would have been scrambling to catch our connecting flight. What's the point in being a Gold Member of Emirates?,5,1
dubai-airport,Ros Brown,United Kingdom,Both in and out of Dubai airport we had to circle for over half an hour due to heavy traffic making for a very concerning rush to catch our ongoing flight we also had to be bussed to the far outskirts of the concourse to catch our flight home to the UK. It appears that the airport is not able to cope with all the additional flights as a result as Dubai becoming the hub airport for several airlines such as Qantas. I will try to avoid it in the future.,2,0
dubai-airport,K Cornelius,Netherlands,My fourth transit through Dubai with Emirates and it may well be my last - masses of people trying to get through security and only 2 stations operating. Emirates hands business class passengers a fast track card but the airport doesn't operate such a facility. No one around to enforce the lines for the stations people pushing from all directions resulting in chaos. Will try Qatar/Doha next time and otherwise resort to Changi again.,4,0
dubai-airport,J Lauhio,Finland,Terribly disappointed by Dubai Terminal 1. Very old and worn out dirty and generally a mess. Staff were rude and didn't seem to care really. Most of the staff we encountered didn't even speak English. This is a truly international airport so English speaking staff would be appreciated. Boarding the airplanes was pretty hectic announcements virtually non-existent and the signage was somehow confusing. It's a shame that Emirates (and Qantas) are the only airplanes flying from T3 since it's the only well-maintained terminal on the airport. T1 was everywhere under renovation so I hope it's going to be better in time.,4,0
dubai-airport,J Pyrah,United Kingdom,The best thing Emirates could do to get better feedback is give people a longer transit time so they can relax for at least a half hour before a connecting flight. That means 2-2.5 hrs between landing and departing as it is you have to almost run to get your flight (not good). Better signage for transit passengers they all seem to funnel down a narrow passage. To be a world leader the snags need to be sorted. Apart from that no time to browse the duty free shops that won't make any money if people rush past.,5,1
dubai-airport,R Kempson,United Kingdom,Have been to Dubai many times over a 10 yr period and have noticed the changes although it is nice and sparkling it lacks friendliness the staff are unapproachable they look the other way I was on the 380 from Manchester in business class had the fast tax card but was not directed to the fast tax queue. I ended up in the arrival queue and had my passport stamped and found I was in the street only to realise I had made a silly mistake I had to now go back in and have my passport re-stamped. Had the passport official noticed I was in transit he could have easily have explained I was in the wrong queue. Once again if the staff were trained to be customer aware and to look out for jet lagged customers then perhaps Emirates will retain their market share. I will be going back to my old airline Singapore airlines who are trained in customer service.,5,0
dubai-airport,Graham Pugh,United Kingdom,My wife my friends and I used to love buying in the duty free shops but the last 18 months of travelling through this airport as been a nightmare 3 years ago I required the use of wheelchair assistance and service was great I would be wheeled to duty free and collected about 20 mins before takeoff and taken to the Gate I could do shopping eat and drink 18 months ago you were wheeled to a cafe for 30 mins and collected and taken to a gate toilet area (no wheelchair) and collected 5 mins before boarding and boarded last so I had to stand and struggle to my seat when people are sorting out bags etc at their seats. Staff did not care.,,0
dubai-airport,Jan Lavender,United Kingdom,We had a stopover on our way back from Singapore with Emirates in the middle of the night. The airport was busy with nowhere to sit unless you wanted to pay for a drink or meal. I ended up sitting on the floor whilst waiting to go through to the departure lounge. I didn't want to go through to the 'holding pen' too soon as I guessed that there would be no facilities other than perhaps a loo and I was right. I realise that seats don't earn a revenue for the airport but I am 60 years old and had just endured an 8 hour flight with another 7 hours ahead of me so just wanted to sit quietly at 3am but it was not to be. Seem to think its a good airport as we stopped in DXB on way out but not if you are in transit. I was also pulled aside and swabs taken with no word of explanation don't know what that was all about.,,0
dubai-airport,Thomas Kelly,United Kingdom,Very disappointed. I'm an airport and aircraft enthusiast and was looking forward to visiting Dubai international. First of all transfers we parked on the desert and had to wait ten minutes for the bus for business and first about 6 people went on the first bus - disgraceful! My wife and I with three baby's under three then waited for further ten minutes for the next bus we then had to carry three baby's five hand luggage down steps to a bus that was like being sardines the ride took twenty minutes to next terminal. After exit we looked for the complimentary prams told they were in the airport we walked for fifteen to twenty minutes with crying baby's until we found one pram. After finding our gate I took my son to the bathroom and it was awful.,,0
dubai-airport,Allen Hill,Thailand,We transferred on a flight both to and from UK. On the incoming flight we arrived at the 380 terminal and it was a short walk to the next gate in the same concourse. Going through security both times was very fast we had fast track cards but really didn't need them the security staff were not very friendly but not a problem. It is very large but in this area well sign-posted the lounges are located next to each gate which is very convenient. On the return flight we had to go from B concourse to A this meant using the train this took less than 5 mins the lounges in this area are not well sign-posted and we were given wrong directions by the information desk! Again the gate is located next to the lounge the lounges are well equipped with snacks and drinks. For us an uneventful transit but I can understand if an incoming flight is delayed then to get to the next gate would be stressful to make it on time. The shops are as any international airport good for window shopping!,8,1
dubai-airport,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,I've been travelling through DXB a dozen times a year for about 10 years now. Given the amount of money spent on it it's not a great airport compared to the likes of Singapore Hong Kong or Seoul. It may look bling but it doesn't work as well as it looks. Short connections of anything less than 2 hours should be avoided. Transit security has not improved at all in recent years. Emirates increasing use of A380's on the routes I fly has reduced the amount of bussing from remote stands which is good. Other than tobacco and alcohol the Duty Free shopping is not especially cheap and I rarely bother now. I don't like the Emirates Business Lounges which have about as much atmosphere as a car wash. It breaks the journey from Europe to Asia but it's not the airport it should have been.,5,1
dubai-airport,Michael Powell,United Kingdom,I have transited through DXB twice in the last couple of weeks travelling on Emirates in Business Class. My main impression is that is just far too big and impersonal as if they have tried too hard to do to much and it just doesn't work. Some of the signs are very confusing. You seem to have to walk a very long way between gates particularly if you are moving from A gates to the far end of the B gates. If your incoming flight parks on a remote stand - as mine did - your transit time can be very long. On the plus side the Emirates lounges are good - if you get the time to enjoy them. No doubt the duty free shopping is also good - if you get the time to do any. I was disappointed by Emirates and the DXB experience just increased my disappointment. Hopefully next time it will be back to Qatar via Doha or Singapore via Singapore.,4,0
dubai-airport,J Martin,Spain,"Emirates fight from HKG to MAD via DXB. Very long immigration queues. No signal of the e-immigration system although we had information on the system in the flight and also included with our boarding passes. Restrooms were not as clean as in Madrid or Hong Kong and with queues. Wifi: it is 30 minutes free but really does not work properly as 20 of the free-offered wifi are needed for the registration in the system. Specially compared to HKIA it is ridiculous. All in this airport is very time-requesting so any transfer in DXB should be taken with an extra time schedule. Shopping area is impressive with big spaces but prices are generally not as convenient as in other places. There are a bunch of brands lacking there. Finally it was printed on our boarding cards that the gates were opening at 6.40 when we arrived to the gate it appeared as ""final call"". Although the materials of the airport are good although the shops are 24 hour open it has been always a sour experience.",5,0
dubai-airport,L Newton,United Kingdom,A pretty awful experience from the 35 minute coach ride to the security queues to enter from Airside to the signage being poor half of the passengers slumped over the chairs in an authentic sub-continent way. The queues for the toilets being 10 minutes long and horrible. Expensive and slow food out lets.,1,0
dubai-airport,E Hettiarachchi,Australia,Wifi only available for 30 minutes. Even that is hard to connect and when you eventually do get connected then the reception keeps dropping. Dubai should work on providing free Wifi all other major and smaller airports do.,5,0
dubai-airport,C Tisserand,Hong Kong,A complete nightmare for passengers. You can fly one the best A380 but the airport is a complete mess. Fly for 9 hours and then made to sit on the floor to wait for the connecting flights. Gate B and C always seem to be in renovation but there is not enough room to accommodate passengers. The current setup is not functional.,,0
dubai-airport,R Taylor,Japan,Clean efficient welcoming and well laid out terminal buildings along with friendly and helpful staff made for a completely stress free experience. My connection time of 2 1/2 hours was more than sufficient arrived at terminal A and departed from terminal B using an airport train which appeared to run every few minutes and was well signposted and easy to navigate. The Emirates business lounge was a little small compared to some lounges at other airports I've used but didn't feel cramped or crowded and staff were attentive and friendly without being intrusive or overbearing. One of the nicest airports I've used over the years and thankfully quite a different experience to some of the other reviews I've read. I'd happily transit through Dubai again in the future.,10,1
dubai-airport,Alastair Finch,United Kingdom,Had to change planes on way back from Australia. If you have a tight connection time the size of the airport can be a problem we were an hour late arriving from Melbourne and the A380 couldn't get in to the dedicated terminal. This meant a frantic dash up and down several escalators and on the train were one of last people on the plane.,8,1
dubai-airport,S Baxter,United Kingdom,Not a good airport to transit through. Terminal 3 is far too small for the number of passengers using it. Hoards of people make it seem like a trip to the shopping mall at Christmas. We had a 20-minute bus journey to the terminal as our 777 parked at a remote gate in the cargo terminal. We had 2 hours 20 minutes for the connections - allow this as a minimum any less and you may miss your connecting flight. Dubai could learn a thing or two from Singapore Changi if they want to become world class.,3,0
dubai-airport,L Osborne,Thailand,"There are a lot of negative comments here and I am not sure how they have arisen. I've been through Dubai airport literally a hundred times over the last seven years and never had any long queues at immigration and never seen a sub-bar bathroom. Pretty good bars and restaurants - far superior to most ""Western"" airports and enjoyed astounding Business lounges when someone else was paying. Have always been impressed by the spacious public areas. Compared to the tacky dirtiness and suffocating spaces in airports like JFK or Heathrow. I hear Terminal 2 is not as good as 1 and 3 so it might be that. My impression is that it's a better airport than Abu Dhabi though the latter has a nice new terminal now.",8,1
dubai-airport,K Cornelius,Netherlands,Arrived on A380 from Amsterdam over 2 hours late because of on the one hand late departure from AMS and on the other hand being put in a holding pattern for an hour. That would have left still one hour for my transit to Bangkok but I hadn't counted on being parked 25 minutes by bus away from the terminal building. Imagine 500 people to be bussed to the terminal. Even though I was in the second bus out by the time I passed security and could start looking for my connecting flight the gate was closed. Queuing for over an hour in front of an understaffed transit desk followed. So I spend the next nearly 7 hours in the airport lounges - my 'new' flight departed one hour late too due to - as was announced by the Captain - the backlog of flights resulting from that night's problems. By the way: signage could do with an improvement as well. This was my first trip through Dubai otherwise always go through Singapore and that seems to be the (much) better choice.,4,0
dubai-airport,Pranjal Singh,India,I had about 3h 30 min as a transit passenger. I had flown in from Amsterdam and was due on a flight to Delhi in the busy morning hours. Our flight literally parked at the fence it took us a good half an hour to reach the terminal in buses (complemented by long queues and a stuffed bus compartment). At the terminal we were subjected to long queues for security but finally when I did manage to reach the duty free it was so expensive that I missed shopping in my Dutch hometown. The terminal is huge but I did manage to reach my gate smoothly. The food is just expensive. One chicken burger meal at the Burger King was 10 dollars and the staff were rude. Overall an average experience and I fly mostly out of Delhi which is the mother of rudeness for local passengers.,5,0
dubai-airport,Alan Finch,United Kingdom,Changed in middle of night from Manchester bound for Perth. Was led to believe there was direct access from the lounge to plane not so and had to go back down to the main concourse. Lounge was fine otherwise airport huge with expensive shops.,8,1
dubai-airport,F B Clement,Japan,Nice but too big. OK if flying with Emirates on the A380 which are parked at gates. Very inconvenient and uncomfortable if flying with the B777 which most of the time are parked at remote locations which means long (20 to 40 minutes) transfers by bus between planes and the terminal building. This is exhausting after (or before long haul flights). I recommend avoiding transit in Dubai unless flying on A380. This regrettable because Emirates is quite a good airline.,,0
dubai-airport,D Olsson,Australia,Still struggling to get to world standard. Widespread delays despite crystal clear weather in Dubai and Europe shows they still have poor organisation. Terminal 3 is OK for transit except for certain faults like broken toilets and staff that only show up to open extra transit security when half the passengers have already arrived. They now limit free wifi to 30min - since it's incredibly slow and flight delays are frequent this is a token effort.,6,1
dubai-airport,A Wragg,Australia,I was taken aback by the aggression and rudeness of the customs official I encountered at Terminal 3 on 2 October 2014. There was a lot of needless angry shouting. Next time I travel to Europe I'll transit through Singapore or give one of the other Gulf countries a try. The unbelievable rudeness of Dubai Airport's customs and security staff has driven away my tourist dollars.,3,0
dubai-airport,Anthony Annakin-Smith,United Kingdom,Dubai is one of the wealthiest places in the world. Why don't they spend that money on a fit-for-purpose airport? Waiting to board our A380 which can carry 500+ people we had to sit in the waiting area with seats for just 100 or so and then wait again at the gate with roughly the same number of seats. Ridiculous! The nearby loos had huge queues not helped by having only two urinals in the gents and some squat toilets in the ladies which no one wanted to use. Information was very poor. We were transferring between flights but on entering the terminal there were directions to areas A B and C but no indicator board to tell us which gate or even area our flight went from. We eventually found an electronic screen where we could enter our flight details to tell us the gate - but it failed to recognise our flight or destination. Overall pretty pathetic.,3,0
dubai-airport,T Patrick,Hong Kong,Pretty appalling flew Emirates and bussed to and from planes. Easy to get lost. Check in and immigration are chaotic with too many people arriving far too early for flights. Transfer area full of Arab and African men. Long lines for men's toilets. Gaudy and expensive duty free. Nearly missed a few flights and baggage always took ages.,3,0
dubai-airport,Junaid Hussain,United Kingdom,Went with 2 kids 2 and under. Given this airport staff extremely helpful put us in shortest queues. Both times from gate to exit door via immigration was about 15 mins total.,9,1
dubai-airport,Qaiser Malik,Pakistan,Beautiful and huge structure doesn't make an airport excellent. The quality of service and staff attitude makes it excellent. To be honest Dubai airport terminal 1 2 or 3 has really poor customer service and immigration counters are the worst in world. Attitude of people on immigration counter and information/management is not welcoming. They are very slow and really need to improve.,4,0
dubai-airport,Tessa Dowling,South Africa,Appalling service. We were shunted from place to place by officious looking over-made up staff. There were also staff in blue shirts who would shout at one where to go. I felt disrespected. No-one could even tell us where the toilet was. There were extremely long bus drives to the plane in hot buses (in one the air-conditioning broke down) - we were not told that it would take so long and because the windows are tinted you cannot look out. There was no communication from the bus driver or the airport about the length of this trip to the plane otherwise I would have insisted on taking some water (as it is one is not allowed water in hand luggage). I have spoken to other people since returning and they have had similar experiences at Dubai. I cannot believe that people can tolerate this - it was beyond awful.,,0
dubai-airport,Andrew McNab,United Kingdom,"Terminal 3 Emirates. Having used DXB on many occasions as a transit passenger I decided to spend a few days in Dubai having come in from Seoul South Korea. Its a long flight from Incheon-Seoul to Dubai of about 11 hours. The thought of another 8 hour flight right back to Glasgow was not that appealing. I would like to emphasis that ""terminal 3"" is operated totally by Emirates. After leaving my taxi I moved into terminal 3. On finding my bearings I went to the appropriate check-in queue for my flight. The check-in line was one massive long queue with about 400-500 people. This number is accurate as I stood in line for about an hour and didn't actually move. So I had plenty of time to count the people more than once. To my complete horror Emirates had 5 check-in desks opened for this number of passengers. After an hour of standing in line people were becoming a bit fed up and beginning to complain (myself included). After about one hour 30 minutes Emirates then announced that another 5 check-ins had been opened to deal with the ""large"" number of people. The only problem was they the new check-ins were in another ""building"". This involved being asked to follow a supervisor who ran us out of the terminal across a busy road into another building then a 10 minute walk to the new check-ins. When I finally arrived I got checked-in for my flight to Glasgow after about 25 minutes. I still had the joy of the assault course and long walk back to terminal 3 to go through immigration and security. Arriving back at terminal 3 I had a seat to get my breath back as I also have limited mobility. On looking at my boarding pass I noticed that I had been allocated the wrong seat. As an Emirates frequent flier I can select and book my preferred seat at no extra cost. The seat I was allocated was not my normal seat I had booked. I was now even more annoyed. The flight itself was excellent but arriving back in Glasgow was a pleasure. This experience with Emirates is one that I hope never to repeat. I have flown Emirates many many times but always as a transit passenger. Deciding to spend some time in Emirates ""home - Dubai"" was a complete mistake. Dubai itself was very interesting and enjoyable. However my Emirates experience from check-in to wheels up was a total disaster to say the least.",4,0
dubai-airport,Andrew McNab,United Kingdom,"I have travelled through DXB on a few occasions and always found it a good experience. When arriving through terminal 3 as a transit passenger you are greeted by lots of shops and places to eat once you come up the escalator. This area tends to be pretty busy so my first priority is usually to find a seat in a quieter area as I have a slight mobility issue (hip replacements). If you move towards the departure gates next to the windows you will find a very different world. It tends to be much quieter with lots of seating so you can relax. My second task is to locate my boarding gate just so I know where it is. Please remember that terminal 3 is a massive building and it takes about 20 minutes to walk from one end to the other. The escalator will bring you up more or less at the midway point. Great choice of places to eat and unlike the UK/Europe they tend to be reasonably priced. I got a nice hot sandwich and a 500ml bottle of water for about £4. Duty free has to be the cheapest in the world the prices are excellent. If you do have limited mobility I would suggest you move to the boarding gates area. Here you will find an electronic walkway that goes along the entire length of the terminal. It makes covering the distance so much easier. For those that are needing a nicotine fix there are two smoking rooms located at each end of terminal 3 departures. I would have no hesitation in recommending DXB as a transit airport as each time I have used it the experience has been positive. Using Dubai as a non transit passenger and going through the standard check-in process with Emirates at their ""HOME DUBAI"" was very different experience and needs another review. DXB as an ""AIRPORT"" is just superb.",8,1
dubai-airport,R Puri,Bahrain,Was transiting through T1. It's a huge terminal with excellent facilities. Lot's of shops food courts and facilities. Wi fi was not that strong. However there were long queues and frequent delays. We were left waiting for 3 hours as our flight kept on getting delayed.,8,1
dubai-airport,F Martin,Australia,Every flight on my trip was delayed here in and outbound and also coming from there into Gatwick. Unless you're in business and can access the lounges Dubai is a pretty poor experience. Bland costly food crowded toilets terrible showers with no place to put your clothes and bags except on the wet floor no charging points for devices except on the walls away from seats or in Starbucks and Costas (under one of the seats). It looks like Dubai has sucked up the world's airline traffic and then done nothing to support the travelling experience except provide cascades of overpriced 'duty free'.,3,0
dubai-airport,Anoma Yao,,In transit Terminal 3. Huge airport with lots of shops food courts and facilities though wifi does not work. Significant improvement for security check the past 2 years good signage but still there may be a long walk to reach your gate. However 2 big and persistent problems: the long and uncomfortable 20 to 25 mn bus drive from the airplanes to the terminal at the arrival and the regular 30 to an hour delays of departing flight.,7,1
dubai-airport,Derek Salter,South Africa,Easy transfer through security. Long walk/journey to the new terminal A. But easy signage and plenty of staff to help. Departure lounges inadequate for a full 380 and seating uncomfortable. Surprised that business first and economy all in same area. Thought they had designed for first and business to have separate entrance direct from lounge. Could have done better with layout but good information and controlled boarding with helpful staff.,7,1
dubai-airport,J Johnstone,United Kingdom,Dubai - Male 22nd February 2014 Flight EK0652. Four hour Emirates flight which took 42 hours. Only food vouchers offered blankets not supplied when requested even for children extremely limited number of seats which you can sleep on. Extremely cold during the night. Terrible communication if you get a delay - I mean zero communication! I never want to go through this airport again! Airport staff seem unable to help with delays.,,0
dubai-airport,Paul Schilizzi,Greece,Immigration lines very long. it took over an hour on arrival although immigration staff very efficient and polite. Everything else excellent.,8,1
dubai-airport,Rohit Raje,India,Lots of helpful staff everywhere simple and easy-to-follow signage lot of clean toilets plenty of seating areas and a plethora of appetizing food. The Departure immigration takes hardly 5 minutes while the arrival immigration takes about 5 to 15 minutes. Faster Immigration than many other airports around the world. Largest Duty Free in the world. Smooth connection between Terminal 1 and 3 and their respective concourses. Terminal 3 the newly built terminal is an incredibly massive terminal. It is very spacious and is equipped with ultra-modern facilities and services. E-gates enable residents of UAE to complete immigration within 60 seconds. The airport has direct connection to both metro and road (taxi car and Bus) networks.,10,1
dubai-airport,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,LGW-DXB-BKK round trip Emirates all flights. My connections were 2 hrs 45 mins and 2 hrs 20 mins respectively. I made the connecting flight on both occasions - but only just. The outbound leg was late in and parking at a remote stand followed by a 25 minute bus drive and ridiculously slow transit security meant that my connecting flight was at Final Call by the time I set foot in the departure hall. A mad dash to the gate and on the flight as it was closing. The return leg was a similar story but at least the A380's seem to be able to park at gates but with touching down 1 hour late and Emirates requiring you to be at your Departure Gate 45 minutes before Departure time the whole thing gets very frantic compounded with bussing and terminal transfers. A few years ago a 1.5 hour connection was OK in DXB - not any more. 2.5 hour minimum and 3+ hours to be comfortable. Terminal Transfers and Security are NOT good and the extreme amount of bussing inflicted on Emirates just turns the whole thing into a very stressful connection compared to Abu Dhabi or Bahrain. Less of a journey more of a sport.,3,1
dubai-airport,Eve Reddish,Australia,Our youngest son was stationed in Dubai with the RAF and we decided to fly with Emirates stop for a short time before flying to UK and Europe. It was in our view absolutely awful. The treatment of passengers from business class and tourist class by customs was appalling. We travelled business class but were treated in Dubai Customs like a couple of criminals. After a wonderful time in the UK and Europe we had to go through Dubai again to get back home to Australia. We had a repeat performance of our first stopover!,,0
dubai-airport,G Roberts,United States,I was expecting great things. Yep I got great things upon arrival over one hour in immigration queue agents were stopping and taking breaks with no relief agent. When they went on break one agent would handle two lines. How about one line for queue? That way when someone has a problem they do not hold up the rest of the line. You have to walk forever upon arrival and departure. I cannot believe they are building it bigger as it is already too big for transiting travel. I will do my best to never have to go through Dubai again. Worst airport I have visited.,1,0
dubai-airport,Christoph Giger,Switzerland,New airport terminal 3 or A is famous. Spacious a good choice of shops and cafes. Reasonable prices. Enough clean toilets drinking water suppliers and seats at the waiting area and gates area. Short queuing times for boarding Airbus 380 economy passengers. Arrival transit passengers must pass security checks. Flexible airport staff which opened additional gates on request. Terminal 2 or B and terminal 1 or C are older. A little crowded with a lot of passengers but shops cafes restaurants and toilets are well equipped and clean with a good choice. Airport staff are polite give good assistance and we felt very comfortable. There is a fast subway airport train to the terminals. The gates for boarding open very early.,8,1
dubai-airport,Daniel Frings,Germany,I transfer here on a monthly basis on my way back and forth to south-east Asia. Aircraft come in waves and during peak hours the terminal gets really crowded. Then restroom facilities tend to be messy despite regular maintenance. Outside of business lounges and the Heineken lounge there is practically never a working wifi because the system seems to be overloaded constantly. This is a real nuisance. Transfer between gates is relatively fast and easy. Neither shopping nor food is exceptional. If connecting through Dubai was not by far the fastest route for me I would avoid this airport.,4,0
dubai-airport,J Wright,United Kingdom,My first stopover in Dubai travelling between Australia and UK using Qantas. Dubai airport compares unfavourably to Singapore where Qantas used to stop on the Australia - UK route. The airport appears gleaming and modern from the outside but once you get inside problems are apparent. I couldn't find any internet terminals. There was no working Wifi. The food outlets are extremely expensive. The toilets were disgusting and absolutely filthy. Based on this experience I think I'll fly another airline and avoid Dubai altogether in future.,4,0
dubai-airport,M Nagra,United States,No USB or universal chargers on the airport Hardly any carpeted area. Outlets on the walls are only for Middle East pins for computers or cell phones. WiFi is easily overwhelmed and practically not working.,2,0
dubai-airport,H Nurdin,Australia,There was a storm in Dubai on 22/02/2014 and all flights in had to be delayed with a large number of passengers arriving in Dubai missing their connecting flights to other parts of the world and being stranded at the airport. Emirates seemed totally unprepared for this event and there were long queues to get tickets rebooked. I had to queue for 2.5 hours to get mine rebooked and was told the earliest available flight to my destination would be the next day meaning that I had to spend a day at the airport. Couldn't afford to stay the night at the airport hotel which costs a staggering USD $250 at the low end. Dubai Airport is a really bad place to get stranded. The many seats did not allow you to lay down and have nap since they have static metallic arm rests that cannot be raised. The lounge style chairs scattered around are taken up pretty quickly sometimes by selfish people who use these lounge chairs to put their baggage on. This airport is typically always crowded and the number of toilets available for that volume of passengers is disproportionately small. Internet connection was very patchy with the network struggling to support the large volume if passengers trying to connect there's paid high speed connections made available as an alternative for passengers. All in all a poor place to be.,2,0
dubai-airport,Ahmad Shaikh,Pakistan,Really modern airport. It was very clean and the lounges exceeded expectations. The staff were very kind and helpful and the signage didn't confuse at all. The food is great. I didn't have to wait because there weren't many queues. The duty free is world class and one of the best airports I have been to.,10,1
dubai-airport,Barrie Enslin,South Africa,Generally I find DXB to be a good airport. Overnight in the Terminal Hotel once which was good. However they can improve by addressing the following: long queues at immigration not enough toilets food ridiculously expensive.,7,1
dubai-airport,Mark Russell,Australia,Massive airport but as a transit passenger I found it to be well sign-posted and had little difficulty in finding my gates and appropriate airport lounge. Overall extremely clean but was very busy both times I was in transit. My only adverse comments were a) when we arrived from Sydney no air-bridge was available so we had to catch a bus to the arrivals hall. This bus trip took some 20 minutes. After a long flight the last thing people want is to get on a bus - to me this cheapens the experience and is not a good look for a relatively new airport and b) I found the entire airport to be overly commercialised - just too many shops and I think there could have been a few more places for people to be seated.,7,1
dubai-airport,H Gibson,Australia,This is definitely the worst airport I have visited in the last 10 years. Noisy crowded bad signage inadequate lighting to name but a few reasons. The toilets were the worst I have seen anywhere in Asia. Most of the duty free shops seem to be owned by one company and are expensive.,1,0
dubai-airport,C Edward,United Kingdom,Went through Dubai Airport en route to Australia. Agree with so many negative reviews. Unfriendly staff shops full of high priced items. The worst part though were the ladies toilets I queued for 25 minutes the toilet rolls were locked in to their dispenser and impossible to retrieve the sink fittings were cheap and nasty all in all I would never go back there. It certainly made me see London Airport s in a new light so much friendlier.,3,0
dubai-airport,Ian Tennant,New Zealand,Utterly appalling. I feel sorry for Emirates as the airline has gone to great efforts to make a first-rate airline with excellent service and great planes. Unfortunately they have Dubai as their hub. While the airport is clean and modern the attitude of staff and the customs process are to be avoided at all costs in future. I travelled to Europe and back over a month transiting via DXB both times and both times customs queue was a very long frustrating wait watching white-robed functionaries chat away instead of processing the passengers in their queues. The disregard for the passengers made me very annoyed especially when no regard was paid to the plight of parents with small children at the end of 22 hours of travelling. I will never travel via DXB again and that unfortunately will mean I cannot fly Emirates.,,0
dubai-airport,Ahmed Sabeeh,Pakistan,Extremely large airport with great range of duty free. Very clean and tidy airport. Signage system was also good and boarding into flights was also easy. Connecting between terminals was also easy. I only had a few concerns the first was that the queues were very long the second the staff were a bit rude and thirdly the Mosque was overcrowded but at an overall excellent and my favourite airport.,9,1
dubai-airport,T Whittington,Netherlands,I don't like Dubai Airport too much. During a stop-over you are trying to kill time perhaps score a bite in one of the overcrowded food places. Often these places are full with litter as the staff cannot keep pace with the plethora of visitors. In general too few places to sit kill time and even for airport standards over priced. And besides shopping for ostentatious items there's very little quality in terms of entertainment to be found at that airport. But it gets even worse when you enter Dubai. I went to Dubai twice in 2008 and 2013 and the customs on both occasions took over an hour which is absolutely ridiculous.,4,0
dubai-airport,Richard Hodges,United Kingdom,Flew into DXB International (T1 with BA) 27 November. No complaints - expected a bit of a wait through Immigration and not too bothered by it as in the end not that long. Luggage also not unduly delayed. Flew out of T1 on BA108 Sunday 8 Dec - was actually pleasantly surprised at how quiet it was. OK - the ground floor is now a retail shopping area but there were plenty of seats upstairs. My wife is a very occasional smoker and even the smoking lounge was relatively nice. Quick and easy bag drop security not unduly long winded so all in all a pleasant experience. Much more so than 4 years ago on our last visit. Maybe when the Al Makhtoum International comes fully on stream things will be even better.,8,1
dubai-airport,A Mole,Australia,Got to be the worst airport compared to numerous other airports I have used throughout the world. Overcrowded with narrow aisles and unfriendly officials. Hate to use this airport and will do my very best to choose anywhere else. If you can avoid using this airport then you would be wise too.,,0
dubai-airport,Graeme Baxter,Zambia,I used to like this airport. Now I find it overcrowded expensive duty-free shopping & restaurants and the most unpleasant immigration staff you will ever find who couldn't care less about the extremely long queues perhaps they were on a go slow.,5,0
dubai-airport,W Bruce,Netherlands,One would expect a major longhaul hub to have sufficient toilet and bathroom facilities. These are sadly lacking at DXB. Toilets are far and few between and when you do eventually find one they are exceptionally small. Expect a queue even at the men's. I don't usually pay much attention to toilets at airports but the scarcity and poor quality of this basic facility at what is billed as one of the world's most modern and state of the art airports was glaring.,5,0
dubai-airport,Ross Clark,United Kingdom,In transit between DXB and GLA. Incoming A380 arrived at Concourse B; the security transit took about fifteen minutes at 0530 and another ten minutes to then get to a departure gate in Terminal A for a B777 service. Although Terminal A is meant to be the dedicated 'A380 concourse' this does not seem to be always happening in practice. The signage in Concourses A and B is OK but the path people have to take to get between them is sometimes quite labyrinthine so it's no surprise that people can get confused.,7,1
dubai-airport,C Hill,Oman,Flew flydubai into Dubai Terminal 2. Queues in immigration hall extended back to the door. Poor queuing system (separate queue for each desk rather than 1 large queue - some queues served by 2 desks others only 1) means some pax wait much longer than others. Waited 1 hour 37 mins to reach immigration officer. Duty Free shop was so small and busy we decided not to use it. Baggage is all scanned as you exit the airport - there was only 1 scanner operating for all passengers - badly organised and chaotic. The queue for taxis was at least 1 hour long. There are no transfer services to Terminal 1 and the Metro. The Terminal is served by a couple of public bus routes but there is no information on the bus timings or routes. No arrival information service to help. Work is obviously ongoing at the Terminal which may address these issues in the future - for now I recommend you avoid this Terminal.,2,0
dubai-airport,R Oussalah,Taiwan,Dubai International Airport has become one of the busiest hubs this means very long transfers between terminals and the signage is not very clear. If you ask one of the many staff members they will direct you. The airport is clean has a wide range of shopping options. However I find it too crowded at times and the waiting at immigration is too long. I like the efficiency of the security checkpoints.,4,1
dubai-airport,S Satari,Malaysia,"Feb 2013. The immigration staff attitude is appalling. They are meant to be intimidating that can be understood but chit-chatting with fellow colleagues totally oblivious to the very long lines is rude. The assistant officers are rude. Asked an assistant about which line to go to for immigration (as the signage is pointing to another lane) got a simple finger-pointing answer. As the answer is not similar to the signage asked again about it get a harsh brush of ""you listen to me"". Nice modern infrastructure with barbaric soft skill.",,0
dubai-airport,Vikas Pal,India,Emirates. Lot of shops but no trolleys available and you need to keep searching to get one. Very lengthy airport so be cautious to check your gate rather than spend a lot of time running from one gate to another especially when Emirates make last minute changes. I stayed for one night in the airport hotel as my next flight was early morning the hotel staff were not courteous at all no gestures no welcome. Some gates are very remote and no shops in those areas.,2,0
dubai-airport,Alasdair Brooks,United Arab Emirates,Over the last few months I've used all 3 terminals for both arrival and departure except for departure from Terminal 1. DXB is a fairly good airport without being in the same league as Incheon or Changi it compares favourably with many regional competitors particularly Doha. Terminal 3 - the dedicated Emirates terminal - is the best of the three. It's modern bright and airy. Shopping facilities are generally good I've always found immigration to be relatively quick and customs is straightforward. Terminal 1 immigration queues look much longer; I was lucky enough to be travelling business class on the way in to Terminal 1 otherwise I might have been stuck in immigration for well over an hour. Terminal 1 is also clearly just a little bit more run down around the edges than Terminal 3. Metro access to Terminals 1 and 3 is straightforward and often a good alternative to taxis. Terminal 2 - where budget airlines are based - is infamously on the other side of the airport and isn't accessible by Metro (and personal experience demonstrates that taxi drivers are very reluctant to take you the short distance from Stadium the closest Metro stop) though it is walkable when it isn't too hot. But once you arrive at Terminal 2 it isn't actually that bad an experience. It may not have the facilities of the other two terminals but renovation is underway and immigration queues are often shorter than Terminals 1 & 2.,7,1
dubai-airport,M J Mathew,Qatar,Terminal 1. Good airport. The car rentals section are spaced out very well and minimum disruption. Quite a walk from the flight to the immigration but that's what happens in a developed airport. Very clean.,10,1
dubai-airport,S Davies,United Kingdom,Usually transit through Dubai on the way to the far east and often don't find it an easy experience. This time Dubai was the final destination. Pleasantly surprised. 30 mins after plane doors opened at an airbridge we were through immigration had collected our luggage passed customs and were out of the terminal. On our return check at the dedicated emirates business desks and security was quick smooth and painless. Terminal 3 and the business lounge was quiet on both journeys 07.30 and 13.00 by Dubai standards which was probably the main reason. Will be passing through Dubai in another month lets hope that our transit experience is as pleasant.,9,1
dubai-airport,Ross Clark,United Kingdom,In transit between GLA and MEL/AKL. Was here in the mid-morning the airport felt quite empty compared with the times I have used it in the past. Concourse A has in my judgement helped a lot by providing the capacity which the airport needed; and its design seems to have corrected some of the now-obvious flaws with the older Concourse B. The train between the concourses works very well. The only grizzle is that the terminals could do with free internet terminals like Changi because the wireless doesn't work quite as well as it should. The security check for passengers in transit seemed to go quite quickly. Generally I would also add that there is no substitute for sitting down beforehand with an airport's terminal maps; they will make your time in that airport go that little bit easier.,7,1
dubai-airport,C Adam,New Zealand,A soulless sterile (except for the toilets) chasm of elevators and luxury-brand shops. Not enough bathrooms fairly dirty and about 100 degrees inside them. Not enough places to sit. The contrast between Emirates' aircraft and in-flight service - which are great - and this hole could not be more stark.,2,0
dubai-airport,Andrew Stevenson,United Kingdom,This review relates to the Emirates / Qantas Terminal 3. This consists of two separate concourses Aâand B connected by an underground train. Despite the massive expansion at Dubai Airport there are still insufficient gates at the terminal at peak hours meaning that some flights park on stand necessitating a long bus transfer to the terminal. Security checks on transiting passengers can be slow. The terminal itself is basically a huge shopping mall with airbridges attached but is otherwise modern clean and attractive. The terminal is very busy but despite what others have said I found plentiful seating although there are insufficient toilets. The individual concourses are easy to navigate but transfers between the concourses require a descent underground via a series of escalators to reach the train that shuttles between the terminals where rather brusque staff bark orders and organize you into queues. Same in reverse when you disembark the train at the other end. Once you reach your departure gate there is at least free wi-fi available albeit only with a moderate strength signal. If you're lucky enough as a transit passenger for your flights to arrive and depart from airbridges within the same concourse then it can be a quick and painless transfer but if you get caught up with bus transfers from remote stands and having to travel between concourses then what might otherwise be a comfortable 2 hour connection becomes a nerve wracking experience.,7,1
dubai-airport,Luis Teles,South Africa,In August 2013 I transited through T3 Dubai Airport from Johannesburg to the UK and back. My connections were 2hrs on the way their and 4hrs on the way back. Queues at transit security moved quite fast. Used the train from terminal A to B easy to use and very efficient. Airport is very clean well sign aged no problems to get to my departures gates.,8,1
dubai-airport,K Howie,South Africa,"An ""over large"" unfriendly airport. Very surly officials slow inefficient processing. Speed queues have not yet arrived in Dubai. Fortunately we were at a quiet time. Lots of overprices shops insufficient toilets and seating areas. A visit to Changi would be beneficial.",3,0
dubai-airport,Kevin Tunnicliffe,United Kingdom,I pass through this airport three times a year on the same route. In recent years it has got better. Queues are shorter for transit security for example. However you step off the plane and know you are going on a mystery tour. Up and sown endless escalators utterly confusing signs and massive overcrowding. Getting off the plane we were faced with signs to transit going in two totally opposite directions more than once. One of them led us into a blank corridor. The trains from one part of the terminal A to B or C or the reverse are very efficient. But until you get to the train you have no idea which bit you are in! Perhaps because of the confused layout there are a lot of staff available to help if you are stuck which is good. Some duty free options are great value but like anywhere else you have to beware because many items are not cheaper.,7,1
dubai-airport,M J Mathew,Qatar,Great facilities and good shopping. Staff everywhere to help.,10,1
dubai-airport,Montague Smith,Australia,What more can you say about DXB that hasn't already been said? It's bursting at the seems and the DFS are laid out in such a way that it sees everyone assembled in the only main corridor that runs the length of the terminal! I got bogged down just trying to navigate my trolley around the place. The immigration and security lines took nearly 1hr with so many empty counters and only 5 staff doing passport checks. Dubai is busiest in the early morning and the evening so you'd think it'd be geared with more staff but that isn't the case. Whenever I fly via DXB I always enter with a sense of dread and accomplishment when I get out of there in one piece. Then new facility for the A380 is fantastic but also crowded though I didn't experience it so much as I was using the lounge but sure enough the lounges were bursting at the seems too. Dubai Airport needs to stop building long narrow tubes and start building wide malls like the massive shopping malls in the city.,3,0
dubai-airport,Shubkarmanjeet Singh,India,I travelled to Dubai last 3 month. Airport was clean the ground staff very helpful. I was pleasantly surprised. The airport was very well sign-posted. The security lines were quite short the personnel manning these were very pleasant and helpful. The bathrooms were extremely clean and the food stalls had lots of interesting things. I highly recommended.,10,1
dubai-airport,S Sen,India,Flew DUS-DUB-CCU with Emirates. First flight landed an hour late but still had 70 min for the next connection. However all hopes of getting the next flight was dashed when we were taken on a slow 35 min ride in a bus around the airport to reach the terminal. The lady at the connecting terminal was extremely rude. Was booked in a hotel. The immigration was the worse I have experienced so far staff are more interested in chatting with each other rather than getting your papers done. I did not expect such a lack of professionalism by immigration staff. The airport is big but is made with the aim of making money. There are more shops than places to sit. I found many people sitting on the floor. Avoid Dubai airport. That is sad since the airline (emirates) is quite nice.,1,0
dubai-airport,Tamara Matushka,United States,Flying from Australia to Ukraine with 1st leg via Emirates (landing at Terminal 3) transferring to Terminal 2 for flight from Dubai to Kyiv. What a mess to get from Terminal 3 to Terminal 2 with no assistance in English to explain or help how to get there. You have to find this minibus which is packed hoping that they will let you in. I'm a pensioner so this was pathetic. At Terminal 2 it was like a refugee camp not an airport terminal. All passengers were trying to get to their gate.,,0
dubai-airport,Rosamund Brawn,United Kingdom,Having experienced transiting through Dubai airport 4 times since Qantas hooked up with Emirates I am most disappointed. The place is noisy overcrowded and the staff rude and unhelpful. It is affronting to go through security as soon as you get off your plane while it refuels - chaos at security with officials shouting and shoving. No time to get to the business lounge after queuing for 20 mins to get through security and then seeing huge queues simply to get into the Business Lounge. And the ladies toilets! Queues are ridiculous. Given the length of the journey Australia - London this ought to be a chance to stretch ones legs and relax a bit in the lounge. No chance! I yearn for the relaxed experience of Singapore airport transit!,,0
dubai-airport,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,One short connection (2hrs) one long connection (7hrs). The 2 hr connection is just about undoable. Still lots of bussing going on to/from remote stands - frantic dash to the gate. Transit Security is perfunctory at best - the staff weren't even looking at the monitors so why bother? On the 7 hour connection I looked for one of these sleeper seat things - dreadfully uncomfortable and the horrible booming sound system in the terminal makes napping almost impossible. Dubai Airport looks the business but when you look beneath the shiny metal and marble it's a pretty poor airport with little consideration for passenger comfort.,3,0
dubai-airport,J Lister,Australia,After all the hype from Qantas which is now code-sharing with Emirates it was very disappointing. Had hoped to check out the Duty Free for our return trip from London but the turnaround time was spent in a queue on another trip through security. Why is there not a transit lounge for short re-fuelling turnarounds? A transit lounge with toilets and coffee would be the sensible thing in the middle of the gruelling London/Australia trip. We also found the security/check in staff intimidating superior and the use of a lot of hand-waving and curt gestures didn't sit well. The terminal was very clean but it took ages lugging all our flight luggage to find a toilet. To buy a cup of coffee one needed to change money a nuisance when in transit for such a short time.,,0
dubai-airport,Charles Green,United Kingdom,Very large. Can take 30 minutes to travel between gates. no view of outside. lots of expensive shopping if you can afford it. Arrogant staff in restaurants/shops. Efficient though.,6,1
dubai-airport,T Hastings,Australia,Clearly Dubai International has been planned as a gigantic money spinner rather than a facility for passengers. The strong emphasis is on duty free shopping so glitzy shops dominate the concourses. It is easier to buy a watch than to find a toilet. There are certainly not enough of them to serve the massive number of passengers. Also the disembarkation and bussing to terminal from my Hamburg-Singapore Emirates flight was primitive to say the least. It added to weariness after a long flight. My main complaint though concerns the total lack of free drinking water in the entire airport. Instead you must convert money into dinars or try to use your credit card to buy a bottle of water. This can only be described as a huge inconvenience for thirsty passengers. In future I'll be using Singapore Airlines and fly through Changi. A pity because the flight itself and the quality of the aircraft were very good.,2,0
dubai-airport,L Osman,United Arab Emirates,Used DXB Intl last week for departure and arrival I understand it can be a nightmare for those who don't live in Dubai specially in the morning my flight was at 8.30am which is the busiest time of the day. Thankfully did online check in however still had to queue for luggage drop off which wasn't very long the line to enter passport control was endless but used e-gate. Had some time to spend in the massive duty free and to have breakfast it feels like a massive shopping mall at the busiest hour of the weekend clean spotless toilets though busy. On the way back was hassle free 4 minutes from the plane touching down until the door was open aircraft parked at the new concourse A which is dedicated to Emirates A380 planes. Had to take the underground train to passport control and after another 4 minutes I was at the belt waiting for my luggage which took a bit of time. Massive clean arrivals hall nice decent duty free and money exchange facilities the only concern is the taxi lines specially at night it was endless long queue. I understand that Dubai airport would be very frustrating for those who are not living in Dubai and don't have the e-gate but I find it the most modern clean airport.,9,1
dubai-airport,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,Emirates are scheduling tighter and tighter connections through DXB. 1 hr 20 mins is simply not doable with traffic delays in the early mornings bussing from remote stands chronically slow transit security rail connections between terminals horrendous walking distances to remote gates and a requirement by Emirates to be at the gate 30 minutes before departure - it's just not possible. Transiting though DXB a few years ago just involved long walks now it's an exhausting and highly stressful undertaking which in future I shall endeavour to avoid by choosing another airline. If Emirates were handling livestock instead of passengers they'd probably lose their licence.,2,0
dubai-airport,D George,Australia,I have transited through DXB several times with Emirates in the last 5 years. The airport is generally clean and well laid out during the most part of they day however past mid night it does become quite busy which results in aircraft having to park far from the terminal bus travel long queues at security and practically no space to sit and toilets are choc-a-block. The most annoying part of travelling through Dubai is probably the rude and unprofessional staff they have manning their duty free shops lounges and security gates. I often make use of the emirates business class lounge while travelling and almost every time I have had to encounter rude staff who make passengers feel unwelcome. After 5 years of having Emirates as my airline of choice I have now moved over to Singapore Airlines & Changi as the transit hub. Emirates is a great airline and its a pity that all the effort put into building the great brand gets tarnished as a result of rude ground staff.,2,0
dubai-airport,J Binns,New Zealand,Dubai is a massive airport and it takes a long time to get from one end to the other. The airport is very crowded with bodies lying everywhere in the main passageways. More seating areas are needed away from the main passageways. Toilets and showers are inadequate for the volume of passengers using the airport. When in transit the security procedure after getting off your plane is frustrating and can be very time-consuming after a long and tiring flight. It always seems difficult to find trolleys for carrying hand baggage. For transit passengers the trolleys need to be located after the security check. Many of my friends in New Zealand avoid Dubai preferring to fly via Singapore (Changi Airport) which seems to be spotlessly clean well organised and with friendly and helpful assistants.,3,0
dubai-airport,J Willing,United Kingdom,I come in and out of Dubai T3 often and my experience thru customs is always the same - utter misery. Why don't they have the common sense to create queues for EU visitors only who can go thru far quicker than most Asians who have all sorts of issues with paperwork etc?,,0
dubai-airport,Bianca Bene,Australia,I have experienced T3 as most other reviewers. I agree that it is very crowded. However I must say the worst thing for me was the unhelpful unpleasant unfriendly and unprofessional attitude of the local staff. This was particularly frustrating as meaningful signage is hard to come by and one has to rely for directions from the airport staff. I have travelled a fair bit but have not experienced such lack of care towards travellers anywhere else. It was a very disappointing experience for me. Like most others I liked Emirates but would try to avoid Dubai as a transit destination in the future.,3,0
dubai-airport,L Osman,United Arab Emirates,I flew last week from and to Dubai Airport T3 with Emirates flights leaving in a morning flight were airport was so crowded as most of flights to Europe leave at the same time however I benefit from the online check in and e-gate so didn't have to queue for check-in or for passport control as always love to scroll around the airport and a lot of choices in the huge duty free options. On the arrival also arrived at midnight which is a very busy period for most flights arrive around same time plane parked in T1 and we had to walk all the way inside the terminal to T3 for the passport control also long queues for passport control but I have my e- gate I pity those who don't have it. Luggage wasn't late at all well organized taxi queue which didn't take more than 5 minutes and I live in the Dubai marina side which is far from the airport however I was at home just after 1 hour from the plane landed.,8,1
dubai-airport,Brian Massey,United Kingdom,On arrival the brand new automatic passport gates did not work and every passenger in the queue with me was rejected from the gate (roughly 40 people with European passports). The queue to see the immigration officer was not too bad - about 15 minutes but they clearly have teething issues with this system. On departure the passport control hall was filled to capacity at 8am in the morning and despite every desk being in operation it took one hour to get through control. Totally unacceptable service and Emirates Airlines must be spitting teeth about this experience. Never mind the airport retailers who lost an hour of shopping trade as a result. Commercially it makes no sense.,6,0
dubai-airport,Scott Inglis,United Kingdom,The terminal is clearly nowhere near big enough to handle the volume of passengers passing through. This seems bizarre considering it is relatively new and Dubai's reputation for building big! It always seems hectic and overcrowded even at 2 or 3 in the morning. There is a general shortage of restaurants and bars and seating is limited at those available. Shopping is also limited and expensive. One plus point is that it is possible to sleep on the lounge seats between gates if you can find an empty one. Take your blanket off your flight if you are transiting and have a long lay over.,2,0
dubai-airport,Noureddine Taleb,Bahrain,Used Terminal 2 because of my FlyDubai flight. I was shocked the terminal doesn't represent Dubai well. I arrived on an early morning flight everything went smoothly. I would recommend for those travelling through terminal 2 it is not the best place to stay for long time.,7,1
dubai-airport,M Mcnamara,Australia,Arrived from Dublin to Dubai airport near midnight on business class. The signs were all over the place send you to turn left then turn right all it needed to say was keep going straight. The airport is very badly air conditioned with temperatures near 28 deg c. A nice 24 deg c would be suffice if you are trying to save energy. When we got to customs there was a huge line even though we had business class tickets. We ended waiting 40 minute in line to clear customs. The only bonus is that at least our bags were ready at the carousel as it took so long. Business class all had chauffeurs to drive you to your hotel. Had to wait another 15 min for this. All in all in took 1 hr 30min to leave the airport to the time we touch down. It's not really world class is it?,1,0
dubai-airport,William Cooper,United States,Long lines and the outside of terminal 1 is total chaos. Always crowed and one runway is always shut down. Horrible place to land takeoff or transit. I have been an airline captain for 33 years and never seen such incompetent management at an airport of this size. Daily nightmare of long waits insufficient toilets rude and surly employees.,,0
dubai-airport,Jason White,Australia,On arrival we had a one hour wait at customs passport control (with infant). 19 Feb 2013 - Flight from LHR - EK008. On departure Emirates flight to Durban. (21 Feb 2013). The terminal experience was not good. After clearing passport control there was nowhere to sit and very limited shops to explore in the terminal.,3,0
dubai-airport,Simon Riddler,United Kingdom,Although good to break a longer journey I would avoid this airport at all costs if you have an alternative! The staff are rude and very slow at security/immigration but worst of all is the shortage of toilet facilities. Not so much a shortage as such but the people who use them spend ages in them and long queues build up. This even occurs in the business class area!,2,0
dubai-airport,Rebecca Rogers,Australia,Just through the new A380 terminal in Dubai which opened fully a couple of weeks ago. Really good idea having the Business Class Lounge as a linked series of lounges grouped to the Gates. So we arrived in to the terminal and walked through the general concourse of shops easily found the signs to follow to find the Business Class Lounge which is on the top floor. Once admitted to the Lounge the thing is to go to your Gate Number and use the lounge area there. You can wander all over and sit anywhere you like but it makes sense to park yourself near your departure gate. Boarding then is easy just put down the champagne glass (in my case!) and go through to the lift which takes you down 3 floors to your aircraft door. The lounge is well set out well appointed good shower rooms (for women can't say about the men) and a series of hot and cold food and drink counters throughout. Very comfortable chairs the usual magazines etc (happy to find a locally printed copy of The Australian). I like the concept and the execution of it. At last a lounge big enough to take the volume of passengers going through in comfort. Well decorated. Staff were the most helpful and friendliest I have encountered even to helping me lift my cabin bag onto the belt for inspection. Happy to use Dubai as my hub.,10,1
dubai-airport,Gaurav Nerkar,India,My Air india flight landed at 4 pm after some 15 minutes of walking I reached passport control. There are around 34 counters for it. I was disappointed to see even though there were so many counters not all were functioning those who were functioning were really at a snail's space - even the queue management was terrible. There is one counter for one queue and three counters for another - we were in a queue with 15 people in front of us that immigration officer took 2.5 hours to process them. Duty free at departure terminal 1 seems limited. I think most duty free shops are in terminal 3. Later I was told that passengers arriving on late night flights face more problems at immigration. I will try and avoid it even for transit.,6,0
dubai-airport,D Rouse,United Kingdom,We flew to Dubai on January 31st 2013 from London Gatwick and faced long queues at passport controls a 2 hour wait. Many desks were not open although there did seem to be staff wandering around doing nothing - why couldn't they have helped? The staff were extremely slow taking at least 5-10 minutes with each person they were extremely unfriendly and obviously have no idea whatsoever about customer care. This really did spoil the start of our holiday we were using Dubai as a stopover for a couple of days. These queues were totally unacceptable and I doubt whether we would ever use Dubai as a stopover again!,,0
dubai-airport,B Gupta,United Kingdom,Passed through terminal 1 on 8th Feb long walk to Immigration where there was already a queue and only 3 desks open why don't they operate a single feeder queue. Seemed like it was going to take ages to get through there was no sense of urgency but we did get through within 30mins. Dubai is another City where for some reason they scan your hand luggage. The arrivals hall has a very small waiting area and meeter's/greeters are not allowed inside so the only way is to go out and stand around. On the way back we encountered another slow moving Immigration queue. Terminal 1 generally looks old and tired shops in departures have a limited range of goods. Nothing special.,6,1
dubai-airport,D Hananel,United States,Generally a good airport though rather uneven very good in certain aspects and with serious shortcomings in others. At one end if you fly Emirates on business this is a fantastic airport with huge lounges minimal or non-existent lines for check-in immigration and boarding. At the other extreme if you are using Terminal 2 you are stuck in a small crowded space with a couple of restaurants not entirely clean bathrooms and a very long transfer from other terminals in minibuses with space so limited that you cannot even stow carry-on luggage. Most experiences in Terminals 1 & 3 fall somewhere in between. Excellent shops and a wide range of restaurants but not much space to sit if you just want to wait for your flight without spending money.,7,1
dubai-airport,Shelley van Heusen,Uganda,Wednesday January 23. I spent 13 hours trying to get a connection flight out that day. No staff available to explain what was going on except that many planes were left in the air or grounded because of fog. Rumour had it that their whole ticket booking system had crashed so their ability to give new tickets to the hundreds of passengers who had missed flights was minimal. People arriving from long flights were arriving and standing in lines that weren't moving and were unsupervised no water no food no information no assistance. Lines were vague and people started yelling. I was in a line for 6 hours and when I got close to the counter the employee left the line with no replacement. I had already been on two long flights from Los Angeles before I got there. You had to walk a long way to find food no directions and you would loose your space in the line. Waited in new lines for another 6 hours and the same thing happened. At about 10.30 that night I found British Airways in another terminal who gave me food and water in their lounge and quickly found me a flight to where I was going and I left a few hours later.,1,0
dubai-airport,T Neyrinck,Belgium,Excellent airport for departures but a nightmare or arrivals because of immigration indeed. Especially frustrating because some lines move 3x faster than other lines. Better do as in the US airports: one queue only but being serviced by multiple desks. Easy to implement and would already make a big difference. Still need to train immigration staff.,3,0
dubai-airport,S Mafukidze,Zimbabwe,I would imagine especially immigration would have done something about the long queues and long hours (1 hour) in my case. To get an eye scan then collect your suitcase on arrival is a nightmare departure is overcrowded and immigration staff take too long with one passenger (5 minutes at one time I noticed) and can stop to chat even when it's noticeable that only 3 counters are open and they have too many passengers waiting. Dubai Airport needs reoriented staff.,2,0
dubai-airport,M Holmes,Australia,The following issues were encountered. 1) 2 hours to get through immigration. 2) Immigration staff talking to each other throughout the processing of entry. 3) After leaving immigration a poor standard of security screening with officers not looking at the scanning outcomes again engaged in discussion. It was a farce. Could not be described as an efficient airport or workforce.,,0
dubai-airport,M Bertram,Australia,This is the second time I've travelled through Dubai and hopefully the last. My main complaint is that immigration takes absolutely forever (1 hour +). They never have enough desks open and the queues move so slowly because the staff spend so long with each passenger. It's very chaotic with everyone getting impatient and stressed and then desperately running to new desks when they are opened. Departure is much smoother though although the airport does feel quite crowded all the time.,3,0
dubai-airport,E Vaughan,Australia,Immigration takes two to five minutes to process each passenger why? Lengthy queues that take ages no organisation. Gates are miles away. Emirates staff seem disinterested.,,0
dubai-airport,Rolf Heimer,Switzerland,Unfriendly staff at Emirates terminal horrible queues without any organization totally crowded airport and business lounges without any silent room or corner. At the gates almost no seating possibility. Small amount of finger docks long bus transfer times to and from the terminal and airplane up to 25 minutes.,2,0
dubai-airport,Agnes Lim,Singapore,Arrived in Dubai airport after midnight to face a human congestion at the immigration where counter staff took their time to chat with one another. Upon leaving terminal 3 with its rows of spanking new but empty counters only 3 counters were open. For our two families the counter staff decided to split us all up citing full flight although we were checking in at 2200 for our 0300 flight. Only on our insistence to see the seating plan did they give us seats together. Half of the passengers had not checked in yet then. It was our first and will be our last time we will use Dubai if we can help it. Duty-free is also bogus. More expensive than most airports.,1,0
dubai-airport,E Lim,Hong Kong,The single most important priority of any large building besides safety is circulation and effective signage. The current Dubai airport fails miserably on both counts. The building is obviously planned and executed outside in rather than inside out with many baffling transfer signages and poorly designed partitions. Why was it not thought out at design stage one wonders. Admittedly the expansion of any airport will pose problems as we can all see in Heathrow but one would imagine Dubai and Emirates with its world class ambitions should have learned from the problems of dysfunctional airports and adopt the merits of successful ones. Staff at the transfer counters look overwhelmed and tired from the late arrival and departure of many flights into Dubai. Overall we expected a lot more from Dubai airport and Emirates after all the commercial hype.,1,0
dubai-airport,A Seah,United Kingdom,Stopped over at this airport twice en route from London to Singapore. Terminal 3 was very busy on my return leg all the ladies toilets in the terminal had queues! On my London to Dubai leg the plane stopped far away from the terminal and we had to take a 20 minute bus to the terminal. The queue to board the Dubai - Singapore Emirates flight was also very messy and chaotic. I would avoid this airport in future.,3,0
dubai-airport,John Chai,Singapore,SIN-CMB-DXB-ZRH CDG-DXB-CMB-SIN. Experiencing Dubai Airport for the first time was horrible. The main sticking point was long queues at immigration. The officers were doing their duty so slowly that all counters had many people queuing. Some counters were not open. Terrible! Terminal was average but toilets were not up to standard very poor compared to Changi Airport. Never again!,4,0
dubai-airport,K Stone,Australia,After getting off a 14-hour flight myself and the boyfriend got stuck in the passport control queue for an hour and a half. We noticed that half the desks were unmanned and the attendants that were working took their time having 5-minute conversations with each passenger. The service was terrible - our attendant decided he didn't like a couple of guys in the queue and kept them waiting while he let others behind them through with no explanation. It took so long for us to get through that when we finally got to the baggage carousel it had stopped and our bags had been taken off. It was an exhausting experience after a long flight the least they could do is staff their desks.,2,0
dubai-airport,Karl Stumke,Kuwait,This airport is huge and bustling. Thank goodness and at long last they seem to have purchased baby strollers so these are actually available now. Avoid buying gold at the duty free its a rip off and u are paying at least 10% over spot. I guess they just try and trap the captive client base they have.,8,1
dubai-airport,C Hazel,Qatar,DOH-DXB: Arrived at a gate far away at terminal 1. Once in the hall the usual (regular traveller) chaos of Dubai ensued queues building up then lanes opened up with a mad dash of desperate travellers looking to beat the rush. Unfriendly immigration staff spending as much time talking to each other as actually serving travellers. The only sure way of beating the rush is to book the Marhaba meet and great service I'm suspicious they make immigration so bad that you are forced to use the Marhaba service!. A lovely 65 minutes in the queue then off to find the bags as they had been taken off the belt as normal.,1,0
dubai-airport,Michael Gruber,Germany,MRU-DXB-MUC with stopover in Dubai. Arrival in the early morning (5.40am) short way to immigration counters. Only half of counters were open each queue of about 20 people. Waiting time 65 minutes! Officers unfriendly and without any kind of motivation. Poor English knowledge. Baggage claim has already finished suitcases were left next to the belt. Quick exit to taxis which are easily accessible and enough in numbers. Check-In (online) so baggage-drop was quick. Efficient security checks but again terrible conditions at the immigration. No problems to spend your waiting time at the shops and cafes.,1,0
dubai-airport,Michael Gruber,Germany,MUC-DXB-MRU. Transfer from the plane with busses to crowded Terminal 3. 3 hours connecting time in DXB at not a problem with shops and restaurants but too many people. Toilets clean but queues everywhere. Departure from B38 - a terrible small dirty and old part between B and C gates. Again transfer with busses to the plane.,5,0
dubai-airport,N Hulm,United Kingdom,Flew into DXB on 06/11/12. Getting off the plane was fine and had a bit of a walk to Immigration. Then it was a nightmare from then on in. The queues for immigration where horrendous and the whole area was full to the brim. We think nearly every desk was open but you could not see it was that far back every now and then a new line would form and a scramble ensued. We decided to stick with our original line. They took between 3-10 minutes to process 1 passenger. 3 hours later we got through! With no apology or anything we would avoid this airport in future. It is quite appalling and they need to sort this out. The knock on effect is that your bags have been taken off the carousel and stored so more time added. Avoid DXB at all costs fly somewhere else until they sort it out!,,0
dubai-airport,Ross Clark,United Kingdom,GLA-DXB-SYD return (with EK). Have used this airport in the past and have concluded that as long as your aircraft does not end up at a remote stand the airport works fine. Incoming the transfer arrangements in Concourse 2 were OK - not sure that yet another security screen is needed. Outgoing some stellar service from the EK airport staff allowed a group of transit passengers to get off a late-running flight from Sydney at one end of Concourse 2 and onto an outgoing service to GLA - at the other end of Concourse 1 - within 45 minutes; and have our luggage make it as well. Am prepared to go through DXB again as it can work well if they try.,7,1
dubai-airport,G Robertson,United Kingdom,Although it is a very modern impressive airport each time I use Dubai airport I get the feeling that the security level though the hand luggage and body scanners is a bit shambolic. A few days ago on leaving Dubai I forgot that I had a 500ml bottle of water clearly on show in a mesh pocket on my back pack type bag this was not picked out either in the scanner or by the security staff. If the 100ml limit of liquids is very much a safety limit this should be a worry.,5,1
dubai-airport,A Sargeant,United Kingdom,Arrival - fine bit of a long taxi and long walk from ramp to get to terminal building Passport Control busy even at 5am but moved quite quickly staff reasonable helpful no real problem. Depart - Terminal 1 was dirty over crowded full of rude people full and full of shops (can't remember seeing any food spaces) taking up all space toilets not nice check in ok but pre security / normal security rowdy chaotic experience. Long queues through passport area to be stamped out of country. Would not recommend as awful experience LHR terminal 3 is better! Future flight to Australia being planned now through Asia rather than Dubai to avoid the airport.,1,0
dubai-airport,Bonita Lawrence,Oman,We arrived for the weekend and spent as long trying to get through the immigration process as we had on our flight. The staff were inadequate in numbers badly trained and rude. Our return experience was much the same thank goodness we arrived early. We spent an hour getting through the process. We experienced an extremely rude and unhelpful policeman/security person. An immigration lady who was unable to smile greet and could only grunt! The airport is one long bottle neck with not enough facilities. Our experience has left us in no doubt that next time we shall travel by car. All the staff need retraining. What a truly dismal experience. Rating 0/10!,,0
dubai-airport,David Smith,Ireland,The other comments are exactly right - was expecting a modern clean world-class airport instead arrived at 2am into an overcrowded chaotic and grubby 3km-long shopping centre.,1,0
dubai-airport,P Tanner,United Kingdom,"Grim experience transiting in both directions between Gatwick and Male with bus transfers to the terminal one in the middle of the night and one in baking heat early afternoon. Have deemed this ""queuing time"". Terminal horribly crowded outbound but only about a quarter as many people on return journey so hard to see that both times this could be down to too many planes competing for the piers. Have done the same journey smoothly twice previously but would avoid Dubai in future and have ruled out transit there for a planned trip to Australia.",2,0
dubai-airport,J Denbakker,South Africa,Had an hour transit on our way to Barcelona. We were also bussed to the building from a long way off. We just made our connecting flight. I agree that the airport is hectic. On our return flight we had a 3 hour layover. Having flown business class we fortunately did not experience the lack of seating and facilities that seems to be a problem; although the business class lounge is also very busy - we noticed that the food stations' quality and selection has deteriorated since last year. Even though we left the business class lounge well before time to get to our gate fighting our way against the streaming tide of shoppers to get to our gate. As a family of four it took concentration to stay together; we just held onto each others' belts and let my husband lead the way! However we still only arrived as they were doing 'last call'. I really needed that glass of champagne I tell you - 9 in the morning or not! We find Doha airport far better but Emirates flights were more suitable to us this time.,7,1
dubai-airport,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,Dreadful Transit on Emirates. Remote parking and bussing to and from remote stands (10 mins to deplane and 20 mins each way on both Arrival and Departure flights) turned my 2 hour comfortable connection into a mad scrabble to get through the dreadful transit security (15 mins) and the full length of the terminal (10mins) to my connecting flight which if you're not at the gate 35 mins before departure you will not be allowed to board - crazy. Emirates have simply too many flights in and out of DXB which despite Terminal 3 being only 2 or 3 years old is now well over capacity.,3,0
dubai-airport,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,Not impressed with the increasing amount of bussing going on in DXB predominantly with Emirates flights - 10 mins taxi-ing to get to some remote stand 10-15 mins to deplane a further 20 mins in a freezing bus and another 15 mins to get through transit security. So that's the thick end of an hour just to get into the Departures Concourse where Emirates expect you to turn up at the gate 35 minutes before departure time and do another 20 minute bus ride back to where you came from. You can just about make a 2 hour transit connection - IF the flight's on time and IF you don't need to go a toilet in the Terminal. Any shorter forget it. The reason for all this? Well it's because DXB has more flight slots than they have gates to service them. And who ends up with all the bussing nonsense? Well Emirates the home carrier of course because if they bussed Cathay Pacific passengers then Cathay Pacific probably wouldn't bother flying to DXB next year. Main Tip - if you have an Emirates connection through DXB make sure it's longer than 2 hours and go to the toilet before landing.,3,0
dubai-airport,R Bayliss,Australia,Transited twice through DXB to/from Europe flying Emirates. DXB is a massive let down. I was expecting a shiny new spacious airport only to be confronted by an overcrowded Westfield with some planes attached. The worst part of it is that I will probably fly through here again due to the excellent connection provided from Aus to Europe but not happily.,1,0
dubai-airport,Patrick Jones,United Kingdom,This airport is geared towards the business / first class traveller with limited concession made for transit passengers on economy. Long queues for toilets limited cafes not enough seating & sporadic signage. With the long & narrow layout making it busier than Oxford St (London) time spent here makes for an unpleasant break from the overall Emirates journey.,2,0
dubai-airport,P Diamond,United Kingdom,First time we have used Dubai for many years as a stopover between UK and Australia and it really has become an unpleasant terminal. Overcrowded no seating and 15 min wait to use very unhygienic toilets. We were on the transfer bus for 25 mins on departure with most people standing. No seating available in the cafes. The terminal is greatly over subscribed and will certainly stop us using Emirates again on this route.,1,0
dubai-airport,Eduardo Alonso,Spain,The passenger terminal is insanely overcrowded but the airfield is even worst. After landing from Madrid we spent one hour taxing around the field because there were no ramps available. It's a shame because it offers very good connections between Europe Australia and far east.,1,0
dubai-airport,J Kanka,United States,I travelled to DXB in Aug-Sep of 2012 and had a very bad experience. I travelled from JFK-DXB for 13 hrs and had to wait at Dubai Immigration lines for another 2 hours. What are those officers thinking. Then comes the over crowded airport - had to wait more than 15 minutes just to use the toilet. Too much shopping. Next time I will travel through Europe.,1,0
dubai-airport,P Khlaikhum,Thailand,One of the worst airports I've ever visited. I was exhausted by the time I arrived here at one in the morning after a decidedly uncomfortable flight and was therefore looking forward to what I had thought would be a swanky modern airport befitting a gulf state famous for the emphasis it places on customer service. I was obviously wrong. With its endless rows of Duty Free shops the airport functions more like a shopping mall than a travel terminal and lacks the sort of facilities other less wealthy places have. Sweated like a pig wandering around trying to find a restaurant or café that wasn't besieged by swarms of equally thirsty passengers. Not only were the crowds nigh impossible to navigate through but throughout my entire four- hour long ordeal here I never managed to find a seat; like many others I was instead forced to squat it out on the floor some distance away from my gate. The inexcusable lack of toilets is further compounded by their filthiness - although there were attendants inside the three which I visited none had any opportunity to actually clean the place due to the queues. As much as I like flying Emirates I'd rather spend my money on Qatar who does transcontinental stopovers at Doha an indisputably nicer place.,1,0
dubai-airport,D Callegari,Australia,"Arrived 2am from Australia to be faced with thousands of people in the arrivals hall! Took two hours to get to the immigration control desk to be greeted by the official who's only word was ""hotel""? A disgraceful way to treat visitors to the country. The unprofessional conduct of the staff manning the desks had to be seen to be believed as they showed total disinterest with the job at hand and spent most of their time shaking hands and greeting or saying goodbye to fellow workers arriving at or leaving the desks. As a result of the 2hour delay our arranged transfer to the hotel via private vehicle thought we had not arrived and left the airport without us. Finally got to the hotel via taxi at 5.30 am! While I was impressed with the service and standard of food on Emirates the airport experience means I would not fly via Dubai on my next trip. Lift your game DBX or more of us will decide to go via Singapore or other airports where they treat you like a real person.",1,0
dubai-airport,Anwar Malon,United Arab Emirates,I am an expatriate resident of UAE and been using DXB International Airport as the gateway to my travels. It is very good to know that the airport has the modern technologies biggest duty free and one of the largest airports in the world. Recently I travelled to Istanbul Turkey via KU and departed and arrived in terminal 1. Unfortunately I am so appalled by the Immigration officers of DXB. Regardless of your nationality or visa status in UAE they will treat you with rudeness impoliteness and arrogance. I highly suggest their quality assurance department to educate and give extensive training to these officers. It is so sad to know that UAE is highly depending on tourism and foreign workers and yet they cannot treat us with respect.,1,0
dubai-airport,Kay Watsonia,New Zealand,Overcrowding of basic facilities has become a real problem. The last 10 years I've transited or stayed in Dubai over 60 times and the conditions have rapidly deteriorated to the point where I am only using it on my next visit to use the last of my air points. I'd rather face Heathrow and LA now than Dubai. Get rid of some of the shops and put in more of what travellers need - toilet facilities and travelators as the distance from 3 to 1 is horrendous unless young and fit. While we understand the need for security and accept that - at least make it practical and pleasant - and as for everyone having to remove shoes before going through a scanner - buy some decent scanners and check those that come up with a problem - not everyone. I'm sadly disappointed at how bad it has become.,5,0
dubai-airport,Roy Mcintosh,United Kingdom,One of the best airports in the world totally let down by the incompetent system at immigration. 2 hours in line and still only half way. Pathetic.,1,0
dubai-airport,Ravi Mene,United Kingdom,This airport is seriously overcrowded. There are long queues for security checks when transiting once through it is like walking an obstacle course due to sheer number of people in the airport. The ventilation is inadequate making it feel warm most of the time. The furthest gates are 30 minutes walk and there are too many shops to tempt the weary passenger? The number of wash rooms are inadequate resulting in queues for everything!,4,0
dubai-airport,Dave Houlihan,Saudi Arabia,In short been through Dubai airport 6 times in 4 months and the queues for immigration are ridiculous. If you are a gcc national you get through in ten minutes as for the rest of the world well can wait up to an hour or more to be met by a sour faced officer. Serious training needed here and this from a country that relies so heavily on tourism.,1,0
dubai-airport,Dennis O'Brien,China,Can only agree with everything said here. I found the airport overcrowded and with little area to get out of everyone's way when you have a long transit time and want to rest: seating is along the walkways and bigger spaces are filled with fast food outlets. Even the gate areas are too small once waiting for boarding. There are insufficient toilet facilities and they are clearly overworked with several urinals and nearly all washbasins out of service in the one I tried. Enormous queues for security check in transit - which is perhaps lucky because signage is very poor and the crowd is about the only way to tell that something probably important is going on here. I could go on - it is very difficult to think of anything good to say about this airport.,3,0
dubai-airport,M Maleque,Bangladesh,I was at the Dubai Airport twice last year on my way to and from London while flying Emirates. Both times I had long transits. On landing I had to face quite a long queue but I didn't have to wait too long to get through. There are lot of shops and restaurants to choose from and overall its quite clean. But the airport is quite crowded and at one time I even had to queue for a long time outside the washroom. Its probably not the ideal airport to take a few hours of rest after a long flight. And the airport Wi-Fi is really poor so using the Internet was difficult.,8,1
dubai-airport,N Winchmore,Australia,When you read some review sites and find negative comments you assume it is due to the reviewer having had bad luck and that it is possibly not that bad. However the reviews here are almost the opposite - most reviews are correct and in fact some almost optimistic. I have been to Dubai airport twice in the last six months and on both occasions Emirates parks 15 minutes away from the terminal and they pack you into a bus and drive you to the terminal. Signage isn't too bad - but why all the security checks? Anyway as described you keep going up and down escalators and finally enter a terribly overcrowded terminal concourse which even at 2am is absolutely packed with passengers. Very difficult to find a seat. There was a queue to use the toilets - but they are clean. How could Emirates expand their flights so much without thinking of airport facilities? It was therefore quite a relief to arrive in Changi Airport Singapore as the next stop. It is such a shame you can't avoid this airport if flying Emirates as Emirates is actually a very good airline.,3,0
dubai-airport,S Srinivasan,United States,I had a decent transit experience at T3 the first time through here 7 weeks ago. My flight from HYD had the misfortune of being parked at a remote stand which meant wasting 20 minutes on a bus back to the terminal. Once in the transit area no signage regarding what to do if transferring to an airline other than Emirates. Security check was fast. Then came the bizarre process of going down a set of escalators walking 50 feet then up another escalators to the floor we were just on this time a little further down the hall. Then came the hike from the far end of Concourse 2 to the transfer desk for BA at the other end of Concourse 1. What's maddening is that the transfer desks are outside security by just a few feet (amazingly to reach them you are told to go the wrong way through the metal detectors) so after getting my boarding pass I had to go through security again even though I'd just been in a secured area! Finally boarding pass in hand I could head for my gate - only to find yet another useless security check! The whole thing took exactly one hour while speed walking through the terminal enduring 3 security checks during that time 2 of which were unnecessary. At least with the exception of one officer at the third and final security check the personnel I encountered were helpful and efficient. The bottom line after two transits through Dubai - if your arriving flight parks at an aerobridge the process isn't bad taking perhaps 30 minutes though you may have to walk a bit. But all bets are off if you get stuck at a remote stand. That risk alone will put me off from choosing to transit through Dubai again.,2,0
dubai-airport,F Damjanovski,Australia,A shockingly designed poorly serviced airport. I had the misfortune of experiencing this airport separately with young kids (1yr and 3yrs) and with an elderly less mobile person. The airport is about 3km long and 100m wide. Meaning it is overcrowded and you have to prepare for a half-marathon just to transfer and get your boarding passes only to have to walk another 3km back to get to the next gate. Furthermore there are no parents rooms (baby change rooms) very few trolleys which are simply impossible to find very few restaurants or cafes to sit rest and refresh at with even less tables and chairs. Certainly not an airport you can enjoy. Poor signage unhelpful airport staff and few people actually speak English. I would certainly not recommend this airport.,1,0
dubai-airport,RK Venky,Singapore,Terminal 3. I have been here twice this month. There is nothing good about this airport terminal except for the look from outside. Immigration took 60-90 min both times. The immigration staff are the worst I have seen. They are rude and unhelpful. Departure hall was over crowded and was difficult to find a place to sit. For an airline like Emirates this is a complete let down.,1,0
dubai-airport,K Petrakakos,United Arab Emirates,Extremely long queues at check-in even worse at immigration. The staff are rude unfriendly and poorly trained. I would not fly from Dubai International if I had the choice.,1,0
dubai-airport,S Srinivasan,United States,I was dreading my recent transit through DXB but it was ok. My flight from LHR landed just before 11 pm I thought this would be an awful time. It took 30 minutes from parking (thankfully at an aerobridge) until I got to my onward gate. Almost all that time was spent walking the vast distances of both concourses from one end to another as my arriving flight was at the far end of concourse 1 and the onwards was at the opposite far end of concourse 2. The transfer itself was a breeze; not a single person in line ahead of me at security check which took all of 45 seconds to get through. There was also plenty of seating space available throughout concourse 2 and no real issues with lack of available toilets or overcrowding in the shopping areas. You can buy pretty much anything you want from the myriad of duty free shops but prices seemed rather high. I'll be going through again in about 6 weeks and I'm hoping lightning strikes twice and I have an easy experience again!,7,1
dubai-airport,John Todd,Qatar,90 minutes queue time on entry. Really slow with their new machines and no information or assistance available. Really bad experience in Terminal 3. Terminal 2 and FlyDubai is so much better than this modern monstrosity that looks like a metal slug and works at the same speed.,1,0
dubai-airport,Maryam Alavi,Canada,Terminal 2 of this airport has the worst conditions. I happened to get stuck in transit in this airport for few days. The condition is terrible: very cold no place to nap very busy poor food no place to charge phone no clean bathrooms and worse than that very rude and unhelpful immigration/airport staff. Terminal 3 of Dubai is very nice and luxurious but if you want to see the real face of Dubai stay in terminal 2 for just one day.,1,0
dubai-airport,Dennis Feenstra,Netherlands,No problems passing through security while transferring. But then a small group of people accompanied by an Emirates ground staff member comes to the security obviously in a rush and skips the queue. No explanation no excuses. It took them 20 minutes all the time we were standing there just being ignored. Dubai Airport is crowded at any given time of the day but in the morning (6 am onwards) it gets really busy. There aren't enough toilets but luckily the rare toilet you will find it kept spotless by the staff. Restaurants are overpriced as at any airport. 6 euro's (8 US dollar) for a coffee and a donut?,8,1
dubai-airport,S Smith,United Kingdom,Arrived Dubai on 1st April from London. Took 1hr 45 mins to get through immigration at 1am. Half the desks unmanned. Departure later in the week slightly less traumatic only 25 mins. Tip - always aim for a desk with a female immigration officer they work at 2 or 3 times the speed of the men.,3,0
dubai-airport,D Martin,Australia,This airport especially T3 lets Emirates down very badly. Emirates being a great airline to fly with it but DXB not a great airport to transit. Transiting at 5am on the way to Europe from Australia is an experience not to be repeated. As someone has mentioned before. Massive queues to go through security again must of been 6 B777 flights arriving at the same time we arrived packed into a small area. Lack of seating not to mention waiting over an hour to clear immigration.,2,0
dubai-airport,Ahmad Hussain,Saudi Arabia,Arrived Terminal 2 at 2.00 am after 3 hours flight delay. When we entered had to wait 1 hr for eye scan then another 40 minutes for immigration. Terminal 2 is small to carry a large number of flights. On the way back again have to face a long check-in line although check-in was quite fast. Inside the departure lounge there are limited number of restaurants but overall is a good experience.,7,1
dubai-airport,B Lee-Chan,United Kingdom,The Dubai stopover to change plane was a nightmare. I had passed through a couple of weeks earlier at 5am and it was very busy. Every passenger has to pass through security even for transit. You can't imagine how busy it was at mid-day when I landed on my return. The arrival hall/security was jammed to the point there was no room left. There were no queues just a huge mass of people pushing and shoving. The business lounge is no better - too small and too many people. Shower facilities are very limited. With a stopover of 1.5 hours it was very stressful. Total shambles.,1,0
dubai-airport,P Rainfield,United Kingdom,Avoid DXB at all costs: DXB especially Terminal 3 is an over-crowded shopping mall. Other than departure gates Terminal 3 lacks everything that an airport terminal should have: (1) sufficient seating: you will be lucky to find a free seat (2) sufficient toilets: expect long lines and filthy toilets (3) sufficient restaurants: few far and between (4) open space: Every open space is taken up by stores and (5) peace and quiet. Even if you fly with Emirates when you disembark you will probably end up taking a 20-minutes bus ride to the arrival area while numerous jetbridges will be sitting free.,1,0
dubai-airport,Paul Buxton,United Kingdom,I have transited several times through this airport - its a nightmare. Minimal air-conditioning makes for an uncomfortable experience. The walkways through the airport are narrow and very crowded for the volume of people that pass through. The signage is poor. The onboard emirates service is good in my experience this airport does not do them justice.,4,0
dubai-airport,Chris Eckett,Malta,You can tell it's a first class airport with forward thinking when building however there are so many flights that go into DXB that it's sometimes overwhelming how many people are there. Last time I went through DXB I stayed overnight in a hotel and the temporary visa experience was awful. Signage not clear whatsoever and immigration officers not too polite.,8,1
dubai-airport,David Pockett,Australia,Enormous and chaotically busy. The Emirates Business Lounge was a disappointment. It's just a big shed with what appear to be thousands of people. Even in the Business Lounge there were queues for the toilets and showers during one transit early in the morning. There were very few tables and chairs for the volume of customers. Food in the Lounge was good; a huge variety and good service. As for the airport overall I think the new one can't come fast enough as there are just too many people using it. It works OK but it is just overrun.,6,1
dubai-airport,Vipul Reddy,Australia,Had a stopover quite a number of times here on a recent trip. If the airplane is parked at a stand it takes a large amount of time to get to the terminal mainly due to the traffic due to other vehicles. Inside airport is very crowded toilets were conveniently placed. For passengers wanting to travel between T3 and T2 and vice versa there is a shuttle bus. Make sure there is adequate time between your flights because the shuttle service only seemed to exist every half an hour or so. T1 is good has a duty free store and some fast food outlets. Not enough power points in fact none at all. The only power points are outside the toilets which are always taken by people wanting to recharge their phones. Free wifi available everywhere in the airport.,8,1
dubai-airport,Anya Lata,Australia,I flew on an Emirates ticket to Europe and back stopping over in Dubai. The airport was very crowded with narrow corridors walking to and from gates. All recreational chairs were taken and there was a lack of chairs at gates in general. The so called Food Court consisted only of one Burger King and one Coffee Shop. Internet access was a problem. Most surprising was the lack of toilets and the fact that people actually had to queue up to get into a restroom.,3,0
dubai-airport,K Scrivens,New Zealand,Dubai airport fills me with dread every time I book Emirates. Just a huge shopping mall where you push through the mass to find your way to your gate. On my sixth time through early in the morning there seemed to be every passenger from every plane arrival in a huge mob with no clear queues waiting to get through only half of the working security scanners. An international hub with thousands of passengers/customers with connecting flights can't function successfully without a business attitude towards customer service. Other aspects of transit are good but overall it's not a pleasurable experience.,4,0
dubai-airport,A Singh,Malaysia,Security lines are simply too long and exhausting when you have 3 kids and bags to stand for 38 mins waiting. Security guards do not need to be friendly but simple basic courtesy is lacking. Counter staff don't go out of their way to give you the information you need. Not enough seats for passengers on transit - sitting on dirty floors with kids is just unacceptable. Whatever plus points are earned flying emirates are lost with the airport experience.,3,0
dubai-airport,Karan Thakur,India,This must be one of the worst airports. I travel regularly it is inevitable I stop at Dubai for transit - or when the wait is over 8 hours go out to one of their hotels. You walk a lot when arriving because signs/indications are not clear the info desk staff are useless unfriendly and at times plain arrogant. The space where you walk is narrow and the place simply overcrowded. Security staff are impolite and unfriendly. The queues are too long and procedures redundant.,2,0
dubai-airport,Peter John,Ireland,Flight from Dublin to Jakarta stop at Dubai. The plane taxied for ages boarded a bus and took about 10 minutes to arrive at airport. There was long queues for security screening. If you don't allow enough time for your transfer flight you may miss your second flight. 1.5 hours is minimum. The airport is very busy the walk way is narrow and people bumping each other in shopping area. There are no good seating areas until your gate is ready to board.,4,0
dubai-airport,Ashraf Hoque,Bangladesh,Over crowded queuing in transit security check. On the other hand once through security - good duty free area. If you have emirates silver/gold card it makes the stay even better with access to the business class lounge! Overall airport and toilets are pretty clean.,7,1
dubai-airport,M Jones,Singapore,I like the service on Emirates flights to and from Asia to UK however every time I dread the transfer at Dubai. Sometimes the walk to the nearest transfer security check feels like a mile. Queues for security are far too long for transfer passengers there is no fast track for first or business passengers - pay a fortune for a first class ticket take part in a scrummage as part of the experience. The signage within the airport is not too good and yes it is always a busy airport. First class lounge is very good though plenty of space free spa facilities good food. Duty free is expensive.,5,0
dubai-airport,R Crossan,United Kingdom,When transiting at DXB if you're unlucky enough to arrive at one of the busy times (early morning in particular) you'll face a significant wait for security checks. This problem pales into insignificance though when compared with the biggest issue: the utter inadequacy of the bathrooms in the concourse area. I've seen lines of 15-20 men waiting outside the bathroom with another 10 inside. If on a short layover at DXB go straight to the gate and there is likely to be a much quieter bathroom there. Of course this is no help to people on 4hr+ layovers who have to wait until the gate opens. Fix this one issue and it would be a decent layover option rather than one I dread.,4,0
dubai-airport,T Patrick,Hong Kong,Huge departure hall with bag drops crammed into corners. No one at e-check in to help. Waited ages to bag drop one man vaguely calling the latest flight people forward - people arriving far too early for flights! Security is painfully slow Emirates staff have no sense of urgency. Upstairs in shopping area - busy crammed. Gates small nothing special. Signs confusing. Really very disappointed. I would put on a level with Heathrow rather than HKG or even BKK airport.,4,0
